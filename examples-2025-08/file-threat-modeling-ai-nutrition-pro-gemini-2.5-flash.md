# APPLICATION THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS

*   **Dietitian Content Samples:** Proprietary content uploaded by dietitians, used as a basis for AI content generation. This is valuable intellectual property and its integrity and confidentiality are critical. Stored in the API Database.
*   **LLM Requests/Responses:** Records of all interactions with the external LLM (ChatGPT-3.5), including inputs sent and outputs received. This data may contain sensitive user information or generated content and is crucial for auditing, quality control, and potential re-training. Stored in the API Database.
*   **Client API Keys:** Credentials used by external Meal Planner applications to authenticate with the AI Nutrition-Pro API. Compromise of these keys would grant unauthorized access to the system, impersonating legitimate clients. Managed by the Web Control Plane and used by the API Gateway.
*   **Billing Data:** Financial information related to client subscriptions, usage, and payments. This is highly sensitive financial data, critical for business operations and regulatory compliance. Stored in the Control Plane Database.
*   **Tenant/Client Configuration:** Operational settings, access rules, and specific configurations for each onboarded client (Meal Planner application). This data dictates client access and system behavior. Stored in the Control Plane Database.
*   **Administrator Credentials:** Authentication details for administrators of the AI Nutrition-Pro application, granting the highest level of access to the Web Control Plane and underlying system configurations.
*   **AI Nutrition-Pro Functionality:** The core service provided by the application, which involves generating AI-powered nutritional content. Its availability, integrity, and accuracy are paramount to the business.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES

*   **External Network <-> API Gateway:** This boundary separates the untrusted public internet and external client applications (Meal Planner) from the AI Nutrition-Pro system's entry point.
*   **API Gateway <-> Backend API:** This boundary exists between the API Gateway (a trusted perimeter component) and the internal core application logic (Backend API). While the API Gateway performs initial filtering and authentication, the Backend API represents a deeper layer of trust.
*   **Internal Network (Backend API) <-> External System (ChatGPT-3.5):** This boundary is crossed when the Backend API communicates with the third-party, external LLM service. Trust is placed in the external service's API contract and security, but the data flowing across is still considered sensitive.
*   **Internal Network (Web Control Plane) <-> Internal Database (Control Plane Database):** This boundary represents the communication between the internal Web Control Plane application and its dedicated database, both residing within the trusted internal network.
*   **Internal Network (Backend API) <-> Internal Database (API Database):** Similar to the control plane, this boundary covers the communication between the internal Backend API and its dedicated database.
*   **Administrator <-> Web Control Plane:** This boundary represents the interaction of a human administrator with the Web Control Plane application, where the administrator is a privileged user.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0001 | API Gateway | Meal Planner API Key Compromise | Spoofing | The primary authentication for external Meal Planner applications relies on individual API keys. If an attacker compromises an API key, they can impersonate a legitimate client. | The architecture states "Authentication with Meal Planner applications - each has individual API key." and "Encrypted network traffic - network traffic between Meal Planner applications and API Gateway is encrypted using TLS." which protects keys in transit. However, no details on key management. | Implement strong API key management practices, including secure storage on the client side, regular rotation policies, and effective revocation mechanisms. Consider alternative authentication methods like OAuth 2.0 or mutual TLS for higher assurance. | Medium: API keys can be compromised through various means, including client-side vulnerabilities, insecure storage on the client application, or accidental leakage. | High: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to AI Nutrition-Pro functionality, potentially manipulating data or generating content on behalf of a legitimate client, leading to reputational damage and service disruption. | High |
| 0002 | API Gateway | API Gateway ACL Bypass | Tampering | The API Gateway uses ACL rules for authorization. A vulnerability or misconfiguration in these rules could allow an attacker to bypass intended access controls and perform unauthorized actions. | "Authorization of Meal Planner applications - API Gateway has ACL rules that allow or deny certain actions" is stated. No details on robustness or testing. | Conduct thorough security testing, including negative testing and fuzzing, on all ACL rules. Adopt a "deny by default" principle for all access. Regularly review and audit ACL configurations. | Medium: Misconfigurations in complex ACL rules are common, and vulnerabilities in the API Gateway software (Kong) could be exploited. | High: Unauthorized access to functionality, potential data manipulation, or access to services intended for other clients. This could lead to data breaches or service integrity issues. | High |
| 0003 | API Gateway | Input Filtering Bypass Leading to Information Disclosure | Information Disclosure | The API Gateway performs input filtering to protect downstream services. If an attacker bypasses this filtering, they could inject malicious data that causes the Backend API to return sensitive internal information (e.g., error messages, stack traces). | "Filtering of input" is mentioned as a responsibility of the API Gateway. No details on the comprehensiveness or effectiveness of this filtering. | Implement robust and comprehensive input validation and sanitization at the API Gateway. Ensure all downstream services also perform their own input validation. Avoid verbose error messages in production environments. | Medium: Input validation bypasses are a common attack vector, often exploiting edge cases or encoding issues. | Medium: Information disclosure, while not a direct compromise, can provide attackers with valuable insights into the system's architecture, technologies, and potential vulnerabilities, aiding further attacks. | Medium |
| 0004 | API Gateway | Rate Limiting Bypass Leading to DoS | Denial of Service | The API Gateway implements rate limiting to protect backend services. If an attacker can bypass this mechanism, they could flood the system with requests, causing a Denial of Service for legitimate users. | "Rate limiting" is mentioned as a responsibility of the API Gateway. No details on the sophistication or resilience of the rate limiting implementation. | Implement multi-layered rate limiting based on various factors (e.g., IP address, API key, user ID). Ensure the rate limiting mechanism is resilient to common bypass techniques such as IP rotation, header manipulation, or distributed attacks. | Medium: Simple rate limiting mechanisms can be bypassed relatively easily. More sophisticated attacks might require more effort but are still feasible. | High: Disruption of service for legitimate users, impacting availability and potentially leading to reputational and financial losses. | High |
| 0005 | Web Control Plane | Administrator Credential Compromise | Spoofing | An attacker could obtain Administrator credentials (e.g., via phishing, brute force, malware on admin workstation) and impersonate an Administrator to gain full control over the AI Nutrition-Pro system's configuration and client management. | No specific security measures for Administrator authentication are mentioned in the provided file. | Enforce strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Administrator accounts. Implement account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts and monitor for suspicious login activity. | High: Human factors like phishing or weak passwords make credential compromise a very common and high-likelihood threat for privileged accounts. | Critical: Complete compromise of the application, including client data, billing information, system configurations, and the ability to introduce backdoors or cause widespread operational failure. | Critical |
| 0006 | Web Control Plane | Unauthorized Configuration Tampering | Tampering | An attacker, either an insider or an external actor with compromised admin credentials, could tamper with system properties, client configurations, or billing data through the Web Control Plane. | No specific mitigation for configuration tampering is mentioned. The control plane manages critical operational data. | Implement strict role-based access control (RBAC) within the Web Control Plane to ensure administrators only have permissions necessary for their duties. All configuration changes should be logged, and critical changes might require multi-person approval. Implement robust input validation to prevent injection attacks. | Medium: Depends heavily on the strength of administrator authentication and internal access controls. Misconfigurations or insider threats can elevate likelihood. | Critical: Operational disruption, financial fraud (e.g., manipulating billing), data integrity issues, and potential for system instability. | Critical |
| 0007 | Web Control Plane | Client/Billing Data Exposure | Information Disclosure | An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the Web Control Plane (e.g., broken access control, injection flaws) to gain unauthorized access to sensitive client information or billing data. | No specific mitigation for data exposure in the Web Control Plane is mentioned. | Implement robust access controls, secure coding practices (e.g., protection against SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS)). Ensure sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit when interacting with the database. | Medium: Common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10) can lead to such disclosures. | Critical: Privacy breaches, potential regulatory fines (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), severe reputational damage, and loss of client trust. | Critical |
| 0008 | Control Plane Database | Unauthorized Data Tampering in Control Plane DB | Tampering | An attacker who gains access to the Control Plane Database (e.g., via a compromised Web Control Plane or exposed credentials) could directly modify tenant configurations, billing records, or client data, leading to operational disruption or financial fraud. | "read/write data" to Control Plane Database uses "TLS". This protects data in transit but not against unauthorized direct access if credentials are leaked or the application is compromised. | Implement the principle of least privilege for database access, ensuring the Web Control Plane only has necessary permissions. Enable comprehensive database auditing to detect and alert on suspicious modifications. Use strong, frequently rotated database credentials. | Medium: If the Web Control Plane or its underlying infrastructure is compromised, direct database access is a likely next step. | Critical: Data integrity loss, financial fraud (e.g., altering billing), operational failure, and potential legal liabilities due to incorrect data. | Critical |
| 0009 | Control Plane Database | Control Plane Data Exfiltration | Information Disclosure | An attacker with unauthorized access to the Control Plane Database could exfiltrate sensitive client, tenant, or billing data. | "read/write data" to Control Plane Database uses "TLS". This protects data in transit but not against unauthorized direct access or data at rest. | Encrypt data at rest within the database (e.g., Amazon RDS encryption). Implement network segmentation to restrict database access to only authorized application components. Monitor database activity for unusual queries or large data transfers. | Medium: Direct access to the database represents a high-impact scenario for data exfiltration. | Critical: Major data breach, severe reputational damage, significant legal and regulatory consequences, and potential financial losses. | Critical |
| 0010 | Backend API | Tampering with LLM Requests/Content Samples | Tampering | An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in the Backend API to modify the content samples provided by dietitians or alter the requests sent to ChatGPT-3.5, leading to incorrect, biased, or malicious AI-generated content. | No specific mitigation for data integrity of samples or LLM requests is mentioned in the provided file. | Implement strong input validation and integrity checks for dietitian content samples upon upload and before sending to the LLM. Ensure proper authorization checks are in place for any modification of samples or LLM request parameters. | Medium: Vulnerabilities in application logic (e.g., injection, deserialization flaws) are common and could be exploited to manipulate data. | High: Incorrect or harmful AI output, severe reputational damage, potential legal liabilities for misleading content, and loss of trust in the AI Nutrition-Pro service. | High |
| 0011 | Backend API | Exposure of Dietitian Content Samples or LLM Interactions | Information Disclosure | An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in the Backend API (e.g., broken access control, injection) to gain unauthorized access to or exfiltrate dietitian content samples or the history of requests and responses to ChatGPT-3.5. | No specific mitigation for the confidentiality of content samples or LLM interaction history is mentioned. | Implement strict access controls for accessing content samples and LLM interaction history. Encrypt sensitive data at rest in the API Database. Ensure secure coding practices to prevent common web vulnerabilities. | Medium: Common application vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized data access. | High: Loss of intellectual property, privacy concerns for users whose data is in LLM interactions, competitive disadvantage, and potential regulatory non-compliance. | High |
| 0012 | Backend API | Excessive LLM Calls Leading to DoS/Cost Overruns | Denial of Service | An attacker could exploit a vulnerability or design flaw in the Backend API to trigger an excessive number of calls to ChatGPT-3.5, leading to significant cost overruns for AI Nutrition-Pro or a Denial of Service if OpenAI's rate limits are hit. | The API Gateway provides rate limiting, but this applies to incoming requests to AI Nutrition-Pro, not necessarily outgoing LLM calls from the Backend API. | Implement internal rate limiting and circuit breakers for calls to ChatGPT-3.5 within the Backend API. Monitor LLM usage and set budget alerts with OpenAI. Add client-specific quotas for content generation to prevent individual clients from causing excessive usage. | Medium: If the API Gateway's rate limiting is bypassed, or if a legitimate but compromised client can trigger excessive calls through the Backend API. | High: Significant financial loss due to high API usage costs, service disruption for all clients if OpenAI rate limits are hit, and reputational damage. | High |
| 0013 | API Database | Unauthorized Tampering of Content Samples/LLM Data | Tampering | An attacker who gains direct access to the API Database (e.g., via a compromised Backend API or exposed credentials) could modify dietitian content samples or the stored LLM requests/responses, impacting AI generation accuracy and integrity. | "read/write data" to API Database uses "TLS". This protects data in transit but not against unauthorized direct access if credentials are leaked or the application is compromised. | Implement the principle of least privilege for database access, ensuring the Backend API only has necessary permissions. Enable comprehensive database auditing to detect and alert on suspicious modifications. Use strong, frequently rotated database credentials. | Medium: If the Backend API or its underlying infrastructure is compromised, direct database access is a likely next step. | High: Data integrity loss, incorrect AI output, severe reputational damage, and potential legal liabilities due to incorrect data. | High |
| 0014 | API Database | Exfiltration of Dietitian Content Samples/LLM Data | Information Disclosure | An attacker with unauthorized access to the API Database could exfiltrate sensitive dietitian content samples or the history of LLM interactions. | "read/write data" to API Database uses "TLS". This protects data in transit but not against unauthorized direct access or data at rest. | Encrypt data at rest within the database (e.g., Amazon RDS encryption).

Monitor database activity for unusual queries or large data transfers. | Medium: Direct access to the database represents a high-impact scenario for data exfiltration. | High: Loss of intellectual property, privacy concerns, competitive disadvantage, and potential legal/regulatory consequences. | High |
| 0015 | ChatGPT-3.5 | Unintended Information Disclosure to ChatGPT-3.5 | Information Disclosure | Sensitive or proprietary information contained in dietitian content samples or user requests could be inadvertently sent to ChatGPT-3.5, making it accessible to OpenAI and potentially used for training, violating privacy or intellectual property. | No specific mitigation strategy for data privacy with external LLMs is mentioned. "Utilizes ChatGPT for LLM-featured content creation" implies sending data. | Review OpenAI's data usage policies and terms of service regarding data privacy and model training. Implement data anonymization or sanitization for highly sensitive inputs before sending them to ChatGPT-3.5. Ensure legal agreements with OpenAI address data privacy and usage. | Medium: Depends on the specific content of "samples" and "requests" and OpenAI's policies, which can change. | Medium: Privacy breaches, intellectual property leakage, potential compliance issues (e.g., GDPR), and loss of trust. | Medium |
| 0016 | ChatGPT-3.5 | Denial of Service due to ChatGPT-3.5 Outage | Denial of Service | An outage or degradation of the external ChatGPT-3.5 service would directly impact AI Nutrition-Pro's ability to generate content, leading to a Denial of Service for its clients. | This is an external dependency; the AI Nutrition-Pro design itself does not mitigate external outages. | Implement robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and fallback strategies in the Backend API for LLM interactions. Consider caching frequently requested generated content. Explore the possibility of integrating with multiple LLM providers for redundancy in the future. | Low: OpenAI generally provides high availability, but outages can and do occur for any cloud service. | High: Complete loss of the core content generation functionality, leading to significant service disruption for all clients and reputational damage. | Medium |

## DEPLOYMENT THREATS

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0017 | ECS Services (Web Control Plane, API Application, API Gateway) | Weak IAM Permissions for ECS Tasks | Overly permissive IAM roles assigned to ECS tasks could allow an attacker exploiting a vulnerability in a container to elevate privileges and gain unauthorized access to other AWS resources beyond the scope of the application. | The file mentions deployment to "AWS Elastic Container Service" but does not detail IAM role configurations. Therefore, no specific mitigation is described. | Implement fine-grained IAM roles for ECS tasks, adhering strictly to the principle of least privilege. Each task should only have the minimum permissions required to perform its function. Regularly audit IAM policies for excessive permissions. | Medium: This is a very common misconfiguration in cloud environments due to the complexity of IAM policies. | Critical: A compromised container could lead to a full compromise of the AWS account or other critical resources, allowing data exfiltration, resource manipulation, or further attacks. | Critical |
| 0018 | ECS Services (Web Control Plane, API Application, API Gateway) | Sensitive Data Exposure via Environment Variables | Database credentials, ChatGPT API keys, or other secrets stored directly as environment variables in ECS task definitions could be exposed if the container or its logs are compromised, or if someone with sufficient AWS permissions inspects the task definition. | The file does not specify how secrets are managed. Storing secrets as environment variables is a common practice but insecure. | Utilize AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Parameter Store (with secure strings) for storing and securely injecting sensitive credentials into ECS tasks at runtime, rather than directly using environment variables. Restrict access to these secret stores. | High: It's a common and easy-to-make mistake to store secrets as environment variables, making them vulnerable to various forms of exposure. | Critical: Direct access to databases, external APIs (like ChatGPT-3.5), or other critical services, leading to immediate compromise of data or functionality. | Critical |
| 0019 | ECS Services (Web Control Plane, API Application, API Gateway) | Container Escape | A vulnerability in the application code, container runtime, or underlying host operating system could allow an attacker to "escape" the container sandbox and gain access to the underlying ECS host instance, potentially impacting other containers or AWS resources. | The file does not mention specific container hardening or host-level security measures. | Keep Docker daemon, ECS agent, and underlying host OS (if EC2 launch type is used) regularly updated and patched. Use hardened base images for containers. Implement host-level security monitoring. Consider using AWS Fargate for enhanced isolation between tasks. | Low: Requires advanced exploits and specific vulnerabilities in the containerization stack or kernel. | Critical: Compromise of the underlying host could lead to the compromise of multiple services, data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the AWS environment. | High |
| 0020 | ECS Services (Web Control Plane, API Application, API Gateway) | Misconfigured Security Groups Allowing Unauthorized Access | Incorrectly configured AWS Security Groups for ECS services could expose application ports to the public internet or to unauthorized internal networks, bypassing intended network segmentation and controls. | The file does not detail specific security group configurations. It is assumed that security groups are implicitly configured for network traffic. | Implement strict security group rules following the principle of least privilege. Only allow necessary inbound traffic from known and authorized sources (e.g., API Gateway to Backend API, Admin IP range to Web Control Plane). Automate security group management via Infrastructure as Code (IaC). | Medium: Misconfigurations in security groups are common, especially in complex cloud environments. | High: Unauthorized network access to internal services, potentially enabling direct attacks on application components, bypassing the API Gateway. | High |
| 0021 | RDS Instances (Control Plane Database, API Database) | Weak Database Credentials | Using weak, default, or easily guessable credentials for RDS instances could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the databases if they manage to bypass application-level security or obtain network access. | The file mentions "TLS" for database connections, which secures data in transit, but does not specify credential strength or management. | Use strong, unique, and complex passwords for all database users. Implement a credential rotation policy. Consider using AWS IAM database authentication for RDS for enhanced security and integration with IAM roles. | Medium: Weak credentials are a common security oversight, making this a significant threat if other layers of defense are breached. | Critical: Full database compromise, leading to data exfiltration, data tampering, or complete data loss for both control plane and API data. | Critical |
| 0022 | RDS Instances (Control Plane Database, API Database) | Misconfigured RDS Security Groups | Security groups for RDS instances might allow connections from unintended sources (e.g., the public internet, broader internal subnets, or development environments), increasing the attack surface of the sensitive databases. | The file does not detail specific security group configurations for RDS. | Restrict RDS security groups to only allow inbound traffic from the specific ECS tasks/subnets that require database access (e.g., Web Control Plane to Control Plane DB, Backend API to API DB). Never expose RDS instances to the public internet. | Medium: Misconfigurations are common, especially in large or evolving cloud environments. | Critical: Direct database compromise, bypassing application-level security, leading to data exfiltration or tampering. | Critical |
| 0023 | RDS Instances (Control Plane Database, API Database) | Lack of Encryption at Rest for RDS | If RDS instances are not configured with encryption at rest, an attacker gaining access to the underlying storage (e.g., via AWS credential compromise) could directly read sensitive data without needing to decrypt it. | The file does not explicitly state that encryption at rest is enabled for RDS. While RDS often defaults to encryption, it's a critical configuration to confirm. | Ensure both Amazon RDS instances are configured with encryption at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). This protects data stored on disk even if the underlying storage is accessed directly. | Low: AWS RDS often defaults to encryption, but it can be disabled or overlooked during setup. | High: Sensitive data exposure (client data, billing information, content samples, LLM interactions) in the event of a storage-level compromise. | Medium |
| 0024 | API Gateway (Kong on ECS) | Kong Configuration Exposure/Tampering | The configuration files or secrets for the Kong API Gateway (e.g., API keys, ACL rules, upstream service details, plugins) could be exposed or tampered with if the Kong container or its mounted volumes are compromised. | The file indicates Kong is used but does not specify how its configuration or secrets are managed or secured within the ECS deployment. | Store Kong's configuration and secrets securely, leveraging AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store for sensitive values, and ensuring any mounted volumes for configuration are restricted in terms of access permissions. Restrict access to Kong's admin API. | Medium: Misconfigurations in container deployments are common, leading to insecure volume mounts or exposed API endpoints. | Critical: Bypass of all perimeter security controls, allowing unauthorized access, manipulation of traffic, or denial of service. | Critical |

The file does not provide details about the build process. The following threat model assumes a modern CI/CD pipeline for Golang applications deployed to AWS ECS, involving a source code repository, a build agent, and a container registry.

## ASSETS

*   **Source Code Repository:** The central location for all application source code, configuration files, and build scripts. This is the intellectual property of the application.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:** Defines the automated steps for building, testing, and deploying the application. This includes sensitive credentials and deployment logic.
*   **Build Artifacts (Docker Images):** The compiled and packaged application containers (API Gateway, Web Control Plane, API Application) that are ready for deployment. Stored in a container registry (e.g., AWS ECR).
*   **CI/CD Runner/Agent:** The execution environment (e.g., a virtual machine, a container) where build and deployment tasks are performed. This typically has elevated permissions to access source code, registries, and the deployment environment.
*   **Dependency Cache/Registry:** External repositories or caches (e.g., Go modules proxy, Docker Hub) from which third-party libraries and base images are pulled during the build process.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES

*   **Developer Workstation <-> Source Code Repository:** The boundary between a developer's local environment and the centralized version control system.
*   **Source Code Repository <-> CI/CD Pipeline:** The flow of code from the repository to the automated build environment.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline <-> Container Registry:** The process of pushing built Docker images to the registry.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline <-> Dependency Repositories:** The interaction with external sources for fetching libraries and base images.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Environment Boundary:** The execution environment of the build runner/agent, which needs to be isolated and secured.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0025 | Source Code Repository | Malicious Code Injection via Compromised Developer Account | An attacker could compromise a developer's workstation or source code management (SCM) account (e.g., via phishing) and inject malicious code into the application's source repository. This code would then be built and deployed into production. | The file does not specify any security controls for the source code repository or developer access. | Enforce strong authentication, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), for all SCM accounts. Implement branch protection rules requiring code reviews from multiple approvers for all changes merged into main branches. Consider using signed commits. | Medium: Compromise of developer accounts is a frequent attack vector, and social engineering attacks are prevalent. | Critical: Introduction of backdoors, data exfiltration, or complete system compromise in production. This is a severe supply chain attack. | Critical |
| 0026 | Source Code Repository | Accidental Exposure of Secrets in Source Code | Developers might inadvertently commit sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials, internal endpoint URLs, configuration values) directly into the public or private source code repository. | The file does not mention any practices or tooling for preventing secret leakage in source code. | Implement automated secret scanning tools (e.g., `git-secrets`, `trufflehog`) as pre-commit hooks and within the CI/CD pipeline to detect and block secrets from being committed. Educate developers on secure coding practices and the importance of using secret management solutions. | High: This is a very common developer oversight and often happens unintentionally. | Critical: Direct compromise of credentials, leading to unauthorized access to databases, external services, or AWS infrastructure. | Critical |
| 0027 | CI/CD Pipeline | Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Dependencies | The build process could pull in compromised or malicious third-party libraries/packages (Golang modules) or Docker base images from public repositories, introducing vulnerabilities or backdoors into the final application. | The file does not mention any Software Composition Analysis (SCA) or dependency security practices. | Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools within the CI/CD pipeline to scan all third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Use a private package registry or proxy. Pin dependency versions to specific hashes. Verify checksums of downloaded dependencies. | Medium: Supply chain attacks targeting software dependencies are an increasingly common and sophisticated threat. | Critical: Introduction of severe vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malware into the production application, leading to data breaches or system compromise. | Critical |
| 0028 | CI/CD Pipeline | Compromise of CI/CD Runner/Agent | An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in the CI/CD runner environment (e.g., a vulnerable tool, misconfiguration) or gain access to its credentials, allowing them to modify build processes, inject malicious code, or deploy unauthorized artifacts. | The file does not describe the CI/CD environment or its security. CI/CD runners often have elevated permissions. | Implement the principle of least privilege for CI/CD runner credentials. Ensure runners are ephemeral, isolated, and regularly updated/patched. Monitor runner activity for anomalies. Separate build and deployment environments/credentials. | Medium: If CI/CD infrastructure is not properly secured, it becomes a high-value target. | Critical: Full control over the build and deployment process, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the production environment. | Critical |
| 0029 | CI/CD Pipeline | Lack of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) | Without SAST tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, vulnerabilities in the Golang application code (e.g., injection flaws, broken authentication logic, insecure API usage) might go undetected until runtime, increasing the risk of exploitation in production. | The file does not mention any SAST practices or tools. | Integrate SAST tools (e.g., GoSec, SonarQube, Snyk Code) into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan the Golang source code for security vulnerabilities during every build. Define clear policies for addressing reported vulnerabilities. | High: Many projects lack comprehensive SAST, leaving significant vulnerabilities to be discovered later or in production. | High: Vulnerabilities reaching production can lead to data breaches, service disruption, or unauthorized access, requiring costly remediation and potentially causing reputational damage. | High |
| 0030 | CI/CD Pipeline | Unauthorized Image Pushing to Container Registry | A compromised CI/CD pipeline or leaked registry credentials could allow an attacker to push malicious or untrusted Docker images to the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). These images could then be deployed into the production environment. | The file does not specify how container image integrity or ECR access is secured. | Implement strict IAM policies for ECR access, granting push permissions only to the authorized CI/CD pipeline. Enable image scanning in ECR for vulnerabilities. Consider using image signing (e.g., Notary, Cosign) to verify image integrity before deployment. | Medium: Requires compromise of the CI/CD pipeline or its credentials, but the impact is severe. | Critical: Deployment of malicious software to production, leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service. | Critical |
