Here are the mitigation strategies for the AI Nutrition-Pro application, addressing threats specific to its architecture and functionality:

*   **Mitigation Strategy: Robust Input Validation and Sanitization (Pre-LLM)**
    *   **Description:** Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization at multiple layers to prevent various attacks.
        1.  **API Gateway (Kong):** Configure rules to enforce schema validation, length constraints, and character set restrictions on all incoming requests from Meal Planner applications. This acts as a first line of defense, filtering out malformed or overly large requests.
        2.  **Backend API (Golang):** Perform more detailed, semantic validation of all data received, especially content samples and parameters destined for the LLM. This includes checking for unexpected control characters, script tags, or patterns indicative of prompt injection attempts. For inputs directly used in database queries, use parameterized queries or Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) to prevent SQL injection.
        3.  **Web Control Plane (Golang):** Apply similar rigorous input validation for all administrator inputs (configuration, client data) to prevent command injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or other vulnerabilities that could compromise the control plane.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Prompt Injection (Severity: High): Prevents malicious input from manipulating the LLM's behavior.
        *   Data Poisoning (Severity: High): Reduces the risk of malicious content samples impacting the LLM's long-term behavior.
        *   Malformed Input (Severity: Medium): Ensures system stability by rejecting malformed requests.
        *   SQL Injection (Severity: High): Protects databases from malicious code injection through user inputs.
    *   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of prompt injection, data poisoning, and various API/database injection attacks by ensuring only well-formed and safe data enters the system.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** The API Gateway mentions "filtering of input."
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Detailed implementation of input validation and sanitization within the Backend API and Web Control Plane, specifically targeting LLM-related threats and database interactions.

*   **Mitigation Strategy: LLM Output Validation and Moderation**
    *   **Description:** After receiving a response from ChatGPT-3.5, the Backend API must validate and potentially moderate the generated content before returning it to the Meal Planner application. This involves:
        1.  **Content Filtering:** Implement algorithms or integrate with a content moderation API (e.g., OpenAI's Moderation API or a custom solution) to detect and filter out harmful, inappropriate, or policy-violating content generated by the LLM.
        2.  **Schema Validation:** Ensure the LLM's output conforms to expected formats and schemas, preventing unexpected structures that could break downstream applications.
        3.  **Sensitive Data Detection:** Scan LLM responses for any accidentally generated sensitive information that should not be exposed to the Meal Planner application or stored in the database.
        4.  **Contextual Review:** If feasible and necessary, perform a lightweight check to ensure the output is relevant to the original prompt and doesn't contain unexpected "hallucinations" or deviations that could mislead users.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Malicious/Inappropriate Content Generation (Severity: High): Prevents the application from distributing harmful or offensive content.
        *   Data Leakage (Severity: Medium): Reduces the risk of sensitive information being unintentionally included in LLM outputs.
        *   Reputation Damage (Severity: High): Protects the application's reputation by ensuring content quality and safety.
    *   **Impact:** Reduces the risk of the application generating and distributing harmful or inappropriate content, protecting the application's reputation and preventing potential data leakage through unintended LLM outputs.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Implementation of post-LLM response validation and content moderation within the Backend API.

*   **Mitigation Strategy: Granular Rate Limiting and Quota Management**
    *   **Description:** Implement robust rate limiting and usage quota mechanisms to control the consumption of AI Nutrition-Pro resources, particularly LLM calls.
        1.  **API Gateway Rate Limiting:** Configure the Kong API Gateway to enforce granular rate limits per API key (meaning, per Meal Planner application). This prevents a single compromised or malicious Meal Planner from flooding the system with requests.
        2.  **Backend API Quota Management:** Implement logic within the Backend API to track and enforce usage quotas for each Meal Planner application, based on their subscription or billing plan. This should actively deny requests once a quota is exceeded and provide appropriate error messages.
        3.  **Circuit Breaker for LLM:** Implement a circuit breaker pattern when calling ChatGPT-3.5. This pattern prevents cascading failures and helps manage LLM costs if the external LLM becomes unresponsive or if there's an unusually high volume of requests from the backend.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Excessive LLM Usage/Cost Overruns (Severity: High): Prevents uncontrolled spending on external LLM services.
        *   Denial of Service (Availability) (Severity: High): Enhances the availability of the service for legitimate users by preventing resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Protects against financial losses due to excessive LLM usage and enhances the availability of the service for legitimate users by preventing resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** The API Gateway mentions "rate limiting."
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Granular rate limiting per API key, usage quota management within the Backend API, and a circuit breaker for LLM calls.

*   **Mitigation Strategy: Multi-Tenant Authorization and Data Isolation**
    *   **Description:** Implement strict multi-tenant authorization rules throughout the application to ensure that each Meal Planner application (and its associated users/data) can only access and modify its own resources.
        1.  **Tenant ID Enforcement:** Every piece of data related to a Meal Planner application (content samples, LLM requests/responses) stored in the API database and handled by the Backend API must be explicitly associated with a unique `tenant_id`.
        2.  **API Gateway Enforcement:** ACL rules in Kong should be configured to verify that an API key is only authorized for its specific `tenant_id` and cannot be used to impersonate or access data belonging to other tenants.
        3.  **Backend API Enforcement:** All database queries and data operations performed by the Backend API must explicitly filter by the authenticated `tenant_id`. This prevents Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities where one tenant could access or modify another tenant's data by simply guessing or manipulating IDs.
        4.  **Web Control Plane Enforcement:** Ensure that the Web Control Plane also enforces tenant-specific access and data isolation for administrators managing Meal Planner applications.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) (Severity: High): Prevents unauthorized access and modification of data across tenants.
        *   Data Leakage between tenants (Severity: High): Ensures confidentiality by isolating each tenant's data.
        *   Unauthorized Access to other tenants' data (Severity: High): Prevents one Meal Planner from interfering with another.
    *   **Impact:** Crucially prevents unauthorized access and manipulation of data across different Meal Planner applications, maintaining data confidentiality and integrity in a multi-tenant environment.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** The API Gateway mentions "Authorization of Meal Planner applications - API Gateway has ACL rules that allow or deny certain actions."
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Explicit enforcement of `tenant_id` at the Backend API data access layer and ensuring comprehensive multi-tenant isolation across all data operations.

*   **Mitigation Strategy: Enhanced Administrator Access Control**
    *   **Description:** Strengthen the security of administrator access to the Web Control Plane, which manages critical system configurations, client onboarding, and billing.
        1.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Mandate MFA for all Administrator logins to the Web Control Plane. This adds a crucial layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if a password is compromised.
        2.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement granular RBAC within the Web Control Plane to ensure that administrators (and other roles like App Onboarding Manager, Meal Planner application manager) only have the minimum necessary privileges to perform their specific duties (principle of least privilege). For example, an "App Onboarding Manager" might not need access to server configuration.
        3.  **Secure Session Management:** Ensure robust and secure session management practices are followed, including short, appropriate session timeouts, secure cookie flags (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`), and immediate session invalidation upon logout or detecting suspicious activity.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Administrator Access (Severity: Critical): Prevents attackers from gaining full control over the system.
        *   System Configuration Tampering (Severity: High): Protects critical system settings from malicious or accidental changes.
        *   Data Breach (Severity: High): Reduces the risk of sensitive client and billing data being exposed.
    *   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to the core administrative functions of the AI Nutrition-Pro application, protecting critical configurations, client data, and billing information from compromise.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not explicitly mentioned, beyond the existence of an "Administrator" role.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** MFA for admin users, granular RBAC for different control plane roles, and specific secure session management practices.

*   **Mitigation Strategy: Database Data-at-Rest Encryption (for Sensitive Data)**
    *   **Description:** Ensure that all sensitive data stored in both the Control Plane Database and the API Database is encrypted at rest.
        1.  **Amazon RDS Encryption:** Configure both `control_plan_db` and `api_db` to use Amazon RDS encryption with AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys. This encrypts the underlying storage volumes, backups, and snapshots automatically, providing a baseline level of protection.
        2.  **Sensitive Fields Encryption (Conditional):** For extremely sensitive data points (e.g., specific parts of dietitian content samples, or identifiable information within LLM requests/responses) within the API database, consider implementing application-level encryption *in addition* to RDS encryption. This would involve encrypting specific fields before storing them and decrypting them upon retrieval, offering an extra layer of protection even if the database itself is compromised.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Data Confidentiality Breach (Severity: Medium-High): Protects sensitive data (dietitian content, LLM interactions, tenant/billing info) from unauthorized access if the underlying storage is compromised.
        *   Compliance Violations (Severity: Medium): Helps meet data protection regulations by ensuring data is encrypted at rest.
    *   **Impact:** Protects the confidentiality of sensitive dietitian content samples, LLM requests/responses, tenant data, and billing information even in the event of unauthorized access to the underlying storage.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Amazon RDS typically offers encryption, but explicit confirmation of its activation and consideration for application-level encryption for specific data is not mentioned.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Explicit confirmation and configuration of RDS encryption for both databases. Assessment for and potential implementation of application-level encryption for highly sensitive data points within the API database.
