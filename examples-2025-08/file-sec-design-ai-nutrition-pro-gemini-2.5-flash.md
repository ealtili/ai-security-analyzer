# BUSINESS POSTURE

The AI Nutrition-Pro application aims to empower dietitians by integrating AI-powered content generation into their existing Meal Planner applications. The primary business goals are:

1.  **Enhance Dietitian Productivity**: By automating the creation of content such as diet introductions, the application reduces manual effort for dietitians.
2.  **Integrate with Existing Ecosystems**: Provide a robust API for seamless integration with various Meal Planner applications, expanding reach and utility.
3.  **Monetization of AI Services**: Establish a scalable platform for offering AI content generation services, including client onboarding and billing management.
4.  **Leverage Advanced AI Capabilities**: Utilize state-of-the-art LLMs like ChatGPT-3.5 to deliver high-quality, relevant content.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed include:

1.  **Data Privacy and Confidentiality**: Handling of dietitian content samples, which may contain sensitive professional information or, if misused, client data. Unauthorized access or leakage of this data could lead to significant reputational and legal damage.
2.  **AI Content Quality and Reliability**: The accuracy, appropriateness, and ethical implications of AI-generated content. Poor quality or inappropriate content could undermine the trust of dietitians and their clients.
3.  **Cost Management of LLM Usage**: Uncontrolled or inefficient use of external LLM services (e.g., ChatGPT-3.5) could lead to unexpectedly high operational costs.
4.  **System Availability and Performance**: Ensuring the AI Nutrition-Pro application and its integrations are highly available and performant to support continuous operation of connected Meal Planner applications.
5.  **Regulatory Compliance**: Adherence to data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA if client data is processed) based on the nature of the content samples and LLM interactions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

## Existing Security Controls

*   security control: Authentication with Meal Planner applications - each has individual API key. (Described in "Security" section, point 1)
*   security control: Authorization of Meal Planner applications - API Gateway has ACL rules that allow or deny certain actions. (Described in "Security" section, point 2)
*   security control: Encrypted network traffic between Meal Planner applications and API Gateway using TLS. (Described in "Security" section, point 3)
*   security control: API Gateway (Kong) provides client authentication. (Described in "AI Nutrition-Pro container context systems and persons" table, "API Gateway" row, "Responsibilities" column)
*   security control: API Gateway (Kong) provides filtering of input. (Described in "AI Nutrition-Pro container context systems and persons" table, "API Gateway" row, "Responsibilities" column)
*   security control: API Gateway (Kong) provides rate limiting. (Described in "AI Nutrition-Pro container context systems and persons" table, "API Gateway" row, "Responsibilities" column)
*   security control: Encrypted network traffic between Web Control Plane and Control Plane Database using TLS. (Implied by "Rel(app_control_plane, control_plan_db, "read/write data", "TLS")" in the C4Container diagram)
*   security control: Encrypted network traffic between API Application and API database using TLS. (Implied by "Rel(backend_api, api_db, "read/write data", "TLS")" in the C4Container diagram)

## Accepted Risks

No explicit accepted risks were mentioned in the provided documentation.

## Recommended Security Controls

1.  **Application-Level Input Validation and Sanitization**: Beyond API Gateway filtering, implement robust input validation within the `API Application` for all data received, especially before processing by the LLM. This mitigates injection attacks (e.g., prompt injection) and ensures data integrity.
2.  **Output Sanitization**: Implement measures to sanitize and validate content received from the LLM before returning it to the `Meal Planner application` to prevent potential malicious or malformed content from being propagated.
3.  **Secrets Management**: Securely manage API keys for `Meal Planner applications` and any credentials for external services (e.g., ChatGPT-3.5 API keys) using a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
4.  **Data Encryption at Rest**: Ensure all sensitive data stored in `Control Plane Database` and `API database` (e.g., dietitian content samples, LLM requests/responses) is encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption.
5.  **Least Privilege Access**: Implement the principle of least privilege for all internal services and databases. Each component (e.g., `Web Control Plane`, `API Application`) should only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform its functions.
6.  **Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring**: Implement centralized logging for all application components and infrastructure, coupled with real-time monitoring and alerting for security-related events (e.g., failed authentication attempts, unusual API access patterns, LLM errors).
7.  **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)**: Integrate security practices throughout the development lifecycle, including:
    *   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Automated code analysis during development and CI/CD.
    *   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Automated scanning of the running application.
    *   **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly check for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.
    *   **Container Image Scanning**: Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities before deployment.
8.  **Runtime Protection**: Implement runtime security for containers (e.g., AWS Fargate's security features, host-level security agents) to detect and prevent unauthorized activities.

## Security Requirements

### Authentication

*   SR-AUTH-001: All external system interactions with the AI Nutrition-Pro API Gateway must be authenticated using unique API keys.
*   SR-AUTH-002: Internal services (e.g., `Web Control Plane`, `API Application`) must use secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., IAM roles, service accounts) to access databases and other internal resources.
*   SR-AUTH-003: The `Administrator` accessing the `Web Control Plane` must authenticate using strong credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

### Authorization

*   SR-AUTHZ-001: The API Gateway must enforce Access Control List (ACL) rules to authorize `Meal Planner applications` for specific actions and resources.
*   SR-AUTHZ-002: The `Web Control Plane` must implement role-based access control (RBAC) for `Administrator` and other management roles to manage clients, configurations, and billing data.
*   SR-AUTHZ-003: Internal services must operate with the principle of least privilege, only having permissions necessary for their designated functions.

### Input Validation

*   SR-IV-001: The API Gateway must perform initial filtering of all incoming requests to mitigate common web vulnerabilities.
*   SR-IV-002: The `API Application` must perform comprehensive server-side input validation on all data received from `Meal Planner applications` (especially dietitian content samples and LLM prompts) to prevent injection attacks (e.g., prompt injection, SQL injection) and ensure data integrity.
*   SR-IV-003: The `Web Control Plane` must validate all input provided by `Administrators` for configuration and management tasks.

### Cryptography

*   SR-CRYPTO-001: All network traffic between external systems (`Meal Planner application`, `ChatGPT-3.5`) and internal components (`API Gateway`, `API Application`) must be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
*   SR-CRYPTO-002: All network traffic between internal components (e.g., `Web Control Plane` to `Control Plane Database`, `API Application` to `API database`) must be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
*   SR-CRYPTO-003: All sensitive data stored in `Control Plane Database` and `API database` (e.g., API keys, dietitian content samples, LLM requests/responses, billing data) must be encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
*   SR-CRYPTO-004: API keys and other secrets must be stored and managed securely using cryptographic best practices and dedicated secrets management solutions.

```

### BUILD process description

1.  **Developer**: The developer writes code for the `Web Control Plane` or `API Application` (Golang services).
2.  **Code Commit**: The developer commits their changes to a version control system.
3.  **Git Repository**: The code is stored in a secure Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, AWS CodeCommit).
4.  **CI/CD Pipeline Trigger**: A push to a specific branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`) triggers the automated CI/CD pipeline.
5.  **Build Container Image**: The Golang application code is compiled, and a Docker image is built for the respective service (`Web Control Plane` or `API Application`).
6.  **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Automated tools scan the source code for common security vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10, CWEs). Issues are reported, and the build can fail if critical vulnerabilities are found.
7.  **Dependency Scanning**: Tools analyze the project's dependencies (e.g., Golang modules) for known vulnerabilities using public vulnerability databases.
8.  **Container Image Scanning**: The newly built Docker image is scanned for operating system and library vulnerabilities. The build fails if high-severity vulnerabilities are detected.
9.  **Automated Tests**: Unit and integration tests are executed to ensure the functionality of the code.
10. **Linter / Code Quality Checks**: Code quality tools (linters) are run to enforce coding standards and identify potential issues.
11. **Publish Build Artifacts**: If all previous steps pass, the validated Docker image is tagged and pushed to an immutable Artifact Repository.
12. **Artifact Repository (e.g., ECR)**: A secure container registry (e.g., Amazon Elastic Container Registry) stores the build artifacts, ensuring version control and integrity.
13. **Deployment to Target Environment**: The validated and scanned container image is then pulled from the Artifact Repository and deployed to the AWS ECS Fargate environment (as described in the Deployment section).

Security controls during the build process:

*   **Supply Chain Security**: Dependency scanning and container image scanning protect against vulnerabilities introduced via third-party libraries or base images.
*   **Build Automation**: The entire process is automated to minimize human error and ensure consistency.
*   **Security Checks**: SAST, dependency scanning, and container image scanning are integrated as mandatory gates in the pipeline, failing the build if critical issues are found.
*   **Immutable Artifacts**: Once an image is built and scanned, it is immutable, ensuring that the deployed artifact is exactly what was tested.
*   **Secure Environment**: The CI/CD environment itself is secured with appropriate access controls and isolation.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

## Critical Business Processes to Protect

1.  **AI Content Generation**: The core functionality of generating diet-related content using LLMs for `Meal Planner applications`. This directly impacts the value proposition and the service offered to dietitians.
2.  **Client Onboarding and Management**: The process of registering `Meal Planner applications` as clients, managing their configurations, API keys, and billing. This is crucial for business operations and revenue generation.
3.  **Data Ingestion and Storage**: The secure handling of dietitian content samples and LLM requests/responses. Loss or corruption of this data would severely impact content quality and service reliability.
4.  **API Integration**: The seamless and secure interaction between `Meal Planner applications` and the AI Nutrition-Pro API. Any disruption affects external users directly.

## Data to Protect and Their Sensitivity

1.  **Dietitian Content Samples**:
    *   **Sensitivity**: High. This data represents proprietary professional content from dietitians. It could contain unique methodologies, specific dietary advice, or even indirectly hint at client information if not properly anonymized by the `Meal Planner application` before submission. Unauthorized access could lead to intellectual property theft or reputational damage.
    *   **Location**: Stored in `API database`. Transmitted between `Meal Planner application` -> `API Gateway` -> `API Application`.
2.  **LLM Requests and Responses**:
    *   **Sensitivity**: High. These include the prompts sent to `ChatGPT-3.5` (which contain dietitian content samples) and the generated responses. If prompts inadvertently contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI) about clients (which should be prevented at the `Meal Planner application` level), then this data becomes extremely sensitive. Even without PII, the combination of input and output represents the core AI-generated value.
    *   **Location**: Transmitted between `API Application` -> `ChatGPT-3.5`. Stored in `API database`.
3.  **Client API Keys**:
    *   **Sensitivity**: High. These keys grant access to the AI Nutrition-Pro API. Compromise could lead to unauthorized usage, data exfiltration, or denial of service through excessive requests.
    *   **Location**: Stored in `Control Plane Database` (for management), configured in `API Gateway`. Transmitted by `Meal Planner applications`.
4.  **Tenant/Client Configuration Data**:
    *   **Sensitivity**: Medium. Includes settings, preferences, and possibly usage quotas for each `Meal Planner application`. Compromise could lead to service disruption or unauthorized changes.
    *   **Location**: Stored in `Control Plane Database`. Managed by `Web Control Plane`.
5.  **Billing Data**:
    *   **Sensitivity**: Medium-High. Contains information related to service consumption and payment. Compromise could lead to financial fraud or privacy breaches.
    *   **Location**: Stored in `Control Plane Database`. Managed by `Web Control Plane`.
6.  **Administrator Credentials**:
    *   **Sensitivity**: Critical. Credentials for `Administrators` to access the `Web Control Plane` and potentially underlying infrastructure. Compromise grants full control over the system.
    *   **Location**: Managed by `Web Control Plane` (authentication system), stored in secure identity store.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

## Questions

1.  What is the exact nature of "dietitians' content samples"? Does it contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI) about end-clients, or is it strictly professional content from the dietitian? What are the mechanisms to ensure PII/PHI is not submitted to the LLM?
2.  What are the Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements for LLM response times and overall API availability for `Meal Planner applications`?
3.  How is the cost and usage of `ChatGPT-3.5` monitored and controlled to prevent unexpected expenses? Are there spending limits or alerts in place?
4.  What are the data retention policies for dietitian content samples and LLM requests/responses stored in the `API database`?
5.  What is the strategy for handling potential "prompt injection" or other adversarial attacks on the LLM via the `API Application`?
6.  Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2) that the AI Nutrition-Pro application needs to adhere to, especially concerning data privacy?
7.  How are API keys for `Meal Planner applications` generated, rotated, and revoked? Is there an automated process for this?
8.  What is the plan for disaster recovery and business continuity for the entire AI Nutrition-Pro system?

## Assumptions

### BUSINESS POSTURE

*   The primary users of the AI Nutrition-Pro API are professional dietitians interacting through third-party `Meal Planner applications`.
*   The business model relies on API usage, implying the need for robust billing and client management capabilities.
*   There is a strong emphasis on maintaining trust with dietitians regarding the quality and security of AI-generated content.

### SECURITY POSTURE

*   AWS cloud native security services will be utilized where appropriate (e.g., IAM, Security Groups, KMS, Secrets Manager).
*   All data stored in Amazon RDS databases will leverage AWS native encryption at rest.
*   All network communication, both internal and external, will enforce TLS 1.2 or higher.
*   API keys for `Meal Planner applications` are considered sensitive and will be securely managed.
*   The `Meal Planner applications` are responsible for anonymizing or scrubbing any sensitive client PII/PHI before sending content samples to AI Nutrition-Pro.

### DESIGN

*   The `API Gateway` (Kong) is deployed within the AWS VPC and manages external traffic routing to internal services.
*   Both `Web Control Plane` and `API Application` services are deployed as Docker containers on AWS ECS Fargate, providing managed infrastructure and container orchestration.
*   Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) is used for both `Control Plane Database` and `API database`, configured for high availability across multiple Availability Zones.
*   The system is designed for multi-tenancy, with `Meal Planner applications` being treated as tenants managed by the `Web Control Plane`.
*   Outbound internet access for the `API Application` (to `ChatGPT-3.5`) is routed through a NAT Gateway for security.
*   CI/CD pipeline includes automated security checks as described in the BUILD section.
