Below is a complete, app-specific list of mitigation strategies tailored to the AI Nutrition-Pro architecture. It focuses on realistic risks introduced by your design and where defenses should live, avoiding generic advice.

Mitigation strategy 1: Strengthen client authentication and authorization at the API Gateway
- Description:
  - Use one Kong Consumer per Meal Planner tenant and ensure each has a unique API key mapped to that Consumer.
  - Enforce ACL groups per Consumer to explicitly permit only the endpoints that tenant is allowed to call; deny-by-default all other routes.
  - Add a request freshness mechanism to reduce replay risk:
    - Require a timestamp header and a short validity window (for example, 5 minutes).
    - Optionally require an HMAC signature over the method, path, body, and timestamp using a tenant-specific secret stored in Kong.
  - Enforce strict per-Consumer rate limits and burst limits in Kong. Prefer sliding-window or leaky-bucket to smooth bursts.
  - Consider optional IP allowlists for partners with static egress.
- Threats mitigated:
  - Stolen or misused API keys enabling unauthorized access (High).
  - Replay of captured requests within TLS-protected channels (Medium).
  - Abusive spike traffic from a legitimate but compromised tenant (Medium).
- Impact:
  - Unauthorized access: significantly lowers probability if keys are scoped to Consumers with deny-by-default ACLs; does not eliminate compromise if a key leaks, but confines blast radius.
  - Replay: high reduction with freshness and HMAC; raises attacker effort considerably.
  - Abuse spikes: moderate reduction; pairs best with quotas/cost controls.
- Currently implemented:
  - Per-app API keys and ACL rules in API Gateway; rate limiting (as stated in Architecture).
- Missing implementation:
  - Request freshness (timestamp/HMAC).
  - Per-Consumer allowlists (if applicable).
  - Explicit deny-by-default posture verified per route and group.

Mitigation strategy 2: Enforce strict tenant isolation in backend API and databases
- Description:
  - Propagate tenant_id derived from the authenticated Kong Consumer through to backend API calls via a trusted header set by Kong (do not accept tenant_id from client input).
  - In the backend API, enforce authorization checks on every data access using the tenant_id from the trusted header.
  - Use opaque identifiers (UUIDv4/ULID) for jobs, samples, and result IDs; never use sequential IDs.
  - Implement row-level tenant scoping in queries (WHERE tenant_id = $1) and ensure no “list all” paths without tenant filter exist.
  - Ensure that retrieval of dietitian content samples for few-shot prompting is strictly tenant-scoped; do not share samples across tenants or with global caches.
- Threats mitigated:
  - Broken object-level authorization (IDOR/BOLA) leading to cross-tenant data exposure (High).
  - Cross-tenant data poisoning where one tenant’s samples influence others’ outputs (Medium).
- Impact:
  - Cross-tenant exposure: high reduction if tenant_id is enforced at every access path; residual risk is primarily coding error.
  - Data poisoning: high reduction by isolating samples per tenant.
- Currently implemented:
  - Tenants exist in Control Plane; distinct Control Plane and API databases.
- Missing implementation:
  - End-to-end tenant_id propagation and enforcement.
  - Opaque ID usage guarantees.
  - Code-level guards preventing cross-tenant sample reuse.

Mitigation strategy 3: Validate and constrain prompt inputs before LLM calls
- Description:
  - Define strict JSON schemas for all API payloads at Kong (request-transform/validate plugins) and in the backend API (server-side schema validation).
  - Enforce hard limits:
    - Maximum sample size per item and maximum number of items per request.
    - Maximum overall prompt length/token budget per request.
  - Normalize inputs to a safe subset (e.g., plain text or whitelisted Markdown subset); reject HTML/script and control characters.
  - Implement pre-LLM redaction:
    - Remove obvious PII-like patterns (names, emails, phone numbers) from dietitian samples before sending to ChatGPT, unless redaction is explicitly disabled for a tenant.
  - Reject binary uploads or unexpected MIME types.
- Threats mitigated:
  - Excessive prompt sizes causing cost blowups and degraded performance (Medium).
  - Unintentional sharing of sensitive data with the external LLM (High).
  - Indirect prompt injection attempts contained in samples (Medium).
- Impact:
  - Cost and performance: high reduction through strict limits.
  - Sensitive data leakage to LLM: moderate to high reduction depending on redaction quality; cannot guarantee perfect PII removal.
  - Prompt injection: moderate reduction by removing markup and controlling format; cannot fully prevent instruction-based attacks.
- Currently implemented:
  - “Filtering of input” at API Gateway is referenced, but not detailed.
- Missing implementation:
  - Concrete schemas and size/token constraints.
  - Input normalization and PII redaction pipeline.

Mitigation strategy 4: Constrain and sanitize LLM outputs
- Description:
  - Request structured outputs (e.g., JSON with predefined fields) from the LLM and validate against a schema before returning to clients.
  - If text output is needed, return Content-Type text/plain or application/json; do not return HTML.
  - Sanitize any Markdown subset or inline formatting to prevent script execution if a client renders it; document rendering expectations to integrators.
  - Enforce output size limits and truncate overly long responses server-side.
- Threats mitigated:
  - Downstream XSS or content injection in Meal Planner UIs that render the output (High for client, Medium for your service liability).
  - Excessive output sizes leading to client-side performance issues or storage bloat (Low to Medium).
- Impact:
  - XSS/injection: high reduction when outputs are strictly structured or sanitized; residual risk exists if integrators ignore guidance.
  - Output size: high reduction by truncation/limits.
- Currently implemented:
  - Not specified.
- Missing implementation:
  - Output schema enforcement and sanitization.
  - Explicit content-type and rendering guidance.

Mitigation strategy 5: Control third-party LLM data handling and retention
- Description:
  - Use OpenAI API settings and contractual terms that ensure prompts and responses are not used for model training and are retained minimally.
  - Where available, enable zero/short data retention options or use a vendor plan that supports it.
  - Avoid sending tenant-identifiable metadata in OpenAI request fields; use internal opaque correlation IDs instead.
  - Provide a per-tenant configuration to opt out of storing prompts/responses in your API database when required by the tenant.
- Threats mitigated:
  - Third-party retention or inadvertent exposure of sensitive content (High).
  - Regulatory/compliance exposure from sending identifiable data to the LLM (Medium to High depending on tenant).
- Impact:
  - Third-party retention: high reduction when zero-retention is enabled; otherwise moderate.
  - Compliance: moderate to high reduction through de-identification and opt-out storage controls.
- Currently implemented:
  - Not specified.
- Missing implementation:
  - Vendor data usage configuration.
  - De-identification of metadata and tenant opt-out paths.

Mitigation strategy 6: Implement per-tenant usage quotas and budget circuit breakers
- Description:
  - Track token usage and request counts per tenant in the backend API (do not trust client-supplied counters).
  - Enforce quotas based on plan: daily/monthly token caps, maximum concurrent jobs, and per-minute request ceilings.
  - When a tenant hits a soft threshold, return warnings in API responses; after the hard threshold, block or degrade service until the period resets or billing is updated.
  - Add a global emergency breaker to pause outbound calls to ChatGPT if spend anomalies are detected within a short time window.
- Threats mitigated:
  - Denial-of-wallet/cost overrun from compromised or misbehaving clients (High).
  - Resource starvation affecting other tenants due to one tenant’s misuse (Medium).
- Impact:
  - Cost overrun: high reduction by enforcing hard ceilings.
  - Resource contention: moderate reduction with concurrency caps.
- Currently implemented:
  - Kong rate limiting exists but does not imply token-based spend control.
- Missing implementation:
  - Token/usage metering and quota enforcement.
  - Soft/hard thresholds and circuit breaker logic.

Mitigation strategy 7: Protect OpenAI API credentials and restrict egress
- Description:
  - Store OpenAI API keys in a dedicated secrets store and inject them only into the backend API task environment; never store in RDS or expose in the Control Plane UI.
  - Ensure only the backend API service can call OpenAI; the Meal Planner never calls OpenAI directly.
  - Restrict outbound network egress at the VPC/Security Group or egress proxy level so the backend API can only reach OpenAI endpoints required for ChatGPT-3.5.
  - Prepare a key rotation playbook and support multiple active keys during rotation without downtime.
- Threats mitigated:
  - LLM API key leakage leading to fraudulent usage and charges (High).
  - Compromised workload using your service to exfiltrate data or scan the internet (Medium).
- Impact:
  - Key leakage: high reduction with proper storage and non-exposure patterns.
  - Egress misuse: high reduction by allow-listing OpenAI endpoints only.
- Currently implemented:
  - Not specified.
- Missing implementation:
  - Secrets management for OpenAI keys and egress allow-list controls.

Mitigation strategy 8: Role-based access in the Web Control Plane tailored to described roles
- Description:
  - Implement explicit roles and permissions:
    - Administrator: full system configuration, no direct read of tenant API keys in cleartext.
    - App Onboarding Manager: can create tenants, issue/rotate API keys (write-only view for keys; show last 4 chars and creation/expiry only).
    - Meal Planner application manager: manage only their tenant’s configuration and view usage metrics for their tenant.
  - Constrain all Control Plane actions by tenant_id and role; deny-by-default for actions outside assigned scope.
  - Provide forced re-authentication for sensitive actions like API key rotation or plan changes.
- Threats mitigated:
  - Misconfiguration or insider misuse resulting in cross-tenant access or secret exposure (High).
- Impact:
  - Cross-tenant misconfiguration: high reduction via least-privilege and scoped actions.
  - Secret exposure: high reduction via write-only key handling.
- Currently implemented:
  - Roles are described conceptually (Administrator, App Onboarding Manager, Meal Planner manager).
- Missing implementation:
  - Concrete RBAC enforcement and key redaction/write-only patterns.

Mitigation strategy 9: Minimize storage and retention of prompts and responses in the API database
- Description:
  - Make storage of prompts/responses configurable per tenant (on/off).
  - Define short default retention windows (e.g., 7–30 days) for stored prompts/responses; purge automatically after expiry.
  - Store only what is necessary for tenant-visible history or support; avoid storing raw inputs if summaries suffice.
  - Provide a tenant API to purge historical prompts/responses on demand.
- Threats mitigated:
  - Exposure of sensitive content if API database is accessed by unauthorized parties (High).
  - Accumulation of high-risk data increasing breach impact (Medium).
- Impact:
  - Data exposure: high reduction by minimizing stored content and retention window.
  - Data accumulation risk: high reduction with automatic purge and on-demand deletion.
- Currently implemented:
  - API DB stores “requests and responses to LLM.”
- Missing implementation:
  - Retention policies, configurable storage, and purge capabilities.

Mitigation strategy 10: Define deterministic LLM prompting templates per tenant without inheriting cross-tenant context
- Description:
  - Use fixed, versioned system prompts and templates stored per tenant; templates should not dynamically include content from other tenants or any global store.
  - Avoid global few-shot examples. If examples are used, ensure they are owned by the requesting tenant only.
  - Include a tenant-specific template version in each LLM call for traceability; reject calls that attempt to set or override the system prompt from user input.
- Threats mitigated:
  - Cross-tenant leakage through shared prompt exemplars (Medium).
  - Prompt injection that attempts to override the system instructions (Medium).
- Impact:
  - Cross-tenant leakage: high reduction by strict per-tenant templating.
  - Prompt override: moderate reduction by ignoring user attempts to alter system prompts.
- Currently implemented:
  - Not specified.
- Missing implementation:
  - Per-tenant prompt templates and enforcement that user inputs cannot alter system prompts.

Mitigation strategy 11: Strict request/response size governance end-to-end
- Description:
  - In Kong, set maximum request body size per endpoint appropriate to expected payloads.
  - In backend API, validate and enforce tighter limits than Kong to protect downstream logic and ensure predictable token usage.
  - Cap response sizes from your API to prevent oversized payloads from the LLM being passed to clients; truncate and annotate when truncation occurs.
- Threats mitigated:
  - Resource exhaustion and OOM in services due to unexpectedly large payloads (Medium).
  - Unbounded spend from very large prompts/responses (Medium).
- Impact:
  - Resource and spend: high reduction with firm size caps both inbound and outbound.
- Currently implemented:
  - Rate limiting is present; no explicit size caps described.
- Missing implementation:
  - Concrete request/response size limits at gateway and service layers.

Notes on scope and realism
- The strategies above avoid generic “monitoring/auditing/backups” and focus on the real risks for an LLM-backed, multi-tenant API fronted by Kong and running on ECS with RDS.
- Several items are partially in place (API keys, ACLs, TLS, rate limiting). The largest unaddressed risks are cross-tenant isolation in code/DB, LLM data handling/retention, quota-based cost control, and input/output controls specific to LLMs. These provide the best risk reduction for effort invested.
