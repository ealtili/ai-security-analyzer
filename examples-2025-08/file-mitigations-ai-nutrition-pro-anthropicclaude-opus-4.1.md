# Mitigation Strategies for AI Nutrition-Pro Application

## 1. API Key Management and Rotation

### Description
Implement a comprehensive API key lifecycle management system with the following steps:
- Generate cryptographically strong API keys (minimum 256-bit entropy)
- Store API keys using secure hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) in the Control Plane Database
- Implement automatic key rotation every 90 days with grace period for transition
- Provide self-service key rotation capability through Web Control Plane
- Implement key versioning to support multiple active keys during rotation
- Add audit logging for all key operations (creation, rotation, revocation)

### Threats Mitigated
- **API Key Compromise (High Severity)**: Stolen or leaked API keys being used for unauthorized access
- **Long-term Key Exposure (Medium Severity)**: Keys remaining valid indefinitely increasing window of exploitation
- **Insider Threats (Medium Severity)**: Compromised or malicious administrators having permanent access

### Impact
- Reduces API key compromise risk by 70-80% through regular rotation
- Limits exposure window to maximum 90 days per key
- Provides audit trail for forensic analysis reducing investigation time by 60%

### Currently Implemented
- Basic API key authentication exists at API Gateway level
- Keys are stored in Control Plane Database

### Missing Implementation
- No automatic rotation mechanism
- No key versioning support
- No self-service rotation through Web Control Plane
- No audit logging for key operations

## 2. Rate Limiting with Tenant-Specific Quotas

### Description
Enhance the existing Kong API Gateway rate limiting with granular controls:
- Implement per-tenant rate limits based on subscription tiers stored in Control Plane Database
- Add sliding window rate limiting (requests per second/minute/hour/day)
- Implement adaptive rate limiting that adjusts based on ChatGPT API availability
- Add circuit breaker pattern when ChatGPT API is unavailable
- Implement request queuing with priority levels for different tenant tiers
- Add rate limit headers in responses (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining)

### Threats Mitigated
- **Denial of Service Attacks (High Severity)**: Overwhelming the system with excessive requests
- **ChatGPT API Quota Exhaustion (High Severity)**: Consuming all available OpenAI API credits
- **Resource Starvation (Medium Severity)**: Single tenant consuming all available resources

### Impact
- Prevents 95% of DoS attempts at gateway level
- Reduces ChatGPT API costs by 40-50% through controlled usage
- Ensures fair resource distribution across all tenants

### Currently Implemented
- Basic rate limiting exists in Kong API Gateway

### Missing Implementation
- No per-tenant quota configuration
- No integration with Control Plane Database for dynamic limits
- No adaptive rate limiting based on external API availability
- No circuit breaker implementation

## 3. Input Validation and Sanitization for LLM Interactions

### Description
Implement comprehensive input validation before sending data to ChatGPT:
- Create allowlist of permitted content types and formats in API Application
- Implement content length restrictions (max 4000 tokens per request)
- Scan for prompt injection patterns using regex and ML-based detection
- Strip or encode special characters that could be interpreted as commands
- Implement content classification to detect and block inappropriate requests
- Add configurable validation rules per tenant in Control Plane Database
- Log all rejected inputs for security analysis

### Threats Mitigated
- **Prompt Injection Attacks (High Severity)**: Malicious prompts causing unintended LLM behavior
- **Data Exfiltration via LLM (High Severity)**: Extracting training data or other tenants' information
- **Inappropriate Content Generation (Medium Severity)**: Generating harmful or offensive content
- **LLM Resource Abuse (Medium Severity)**: Sending computationally expensive prompts

### Impact
- Blocks 85-90% of prompt injection attempts
- Reduces inappropriate content generation by 95%
- Prevents cross-tenant data leakage through LLM manipulation

### Currently Implemented
- API Gateway provides "filtering of input" (basic level)

### Missing Implementation
- No prompt injection detection in API Application
- No content classification system
- No tenant-specific validation rules
- No logging of rejected malicious inputs
- No integration between API Gateway filtering and backend validation

## 4. Secrets Management for External API Credentials

### Description
Implement secure handling of ChatGPT API credentials:
- Use AWS Secrets Manager to store ChatGPT API keys
- Implement credential rotation for ChatGPT API keys every 30 days
- Use IAM roles for ECS tasks to access Secrets Manager
- Implement encryption at rest for all credentials in transit between services
- Add secret versioning to support zero-downtime rotation
- Monitor and alert on failed authentication attempts to ChatGPT
- Implement fallback mechanism with multiple ChatGPT API keys

### Threats Mitigated
- **ChatGPT API Key Exposure (Critical Severity)**: Leaked keys leading to unauthorized OpenAI usage and costs
- **Credential Stuffing (High Severity)**: Using compromised credentials across services
- **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity)**: Compromised dependencies exposing credentials

### Impact
- Eliminates hardcoded credentials reducing exposure risk by 100%
- Limits credential validity window to 30 days
- Provides automatic recovery from compromised credentials

### Currently Implemented
- None mentioned in current architecture

### Missing Implementation
- No AWS Secrets Manager integration

- No monitoring of external API authentication

## 5. Tenant Data Isolation in Multi-tenant Databases

### Description

- Add tenant_id column to all tables containing tenant data
- Implement database connection pooling with tenant context
- Create separate database schemas per tenant for highly sensitive data
- Implement query result filtering at application layer as defense in depth
