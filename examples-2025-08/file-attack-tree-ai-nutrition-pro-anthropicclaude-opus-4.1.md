## 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

### High-Risk Paths

1. **API Key Compromise (2.1)** - **Critical Priority**
   - **Justification:** API keys are the primary authentication mechanism. Weak key generation, lack of rotation, or exposure through compromised Meal Planner apps could grant full API access.

2. **Prompt Injection via LLM Integration (3.2.1, 5.2)** - **Critical Priority**
   - **Justification:** Direct integration with ChatGPT without proper input sanitization could allow attackers to manipulate AI responses, potentially generating harmful nutrition advice or extracting sensitive data.

3. **SQL Injection (4.1)** - **High Priority**
   - **Justification:** Both API and Control Plane interact with RDS databases. Successful SQL injection could lead to complete data breach including dietitian content and billing information.

4. **Input Filter Evasion (1.2)** - **High Priority**
   - **Justification:** Kong's input filtering is a critical security control. Bypassing it could enable various downstream attacks including injection attacks.

### Critical Nodes

- **API Gateway:** Single point of entry for all external requests
- **API Keys:** Primary authentication mechanism
- **ChatGPT Integration:** External dependency with potential for manipulation
- **RDS Databases:** Central data stores containing sensitive information

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies

### For API Key Security (2.1)
- Implement cryptographically secure API key generation
- Enforce API key rotation policies
- Use API key scoping to limit permissions
- Implement anomaly detection for API key usage patterns
- Consider OAuth 2.0 or mutual TLS for enhanced authentication

### For LLM Integration Security (3.2, 5.x)
- Implement robust input sanitization before sending to ChatGPT
- Use prompt templates with strict validation
- Implement output filtering to detect harmful content
- Rate limit LLM API calls per client
- Monitor for prompt injection patterns
- Implement content moderation for dietitian samples

### For Database Security (4.x)
- Use parameterized queries exclusively
- Implement database activity monitoring
- Use AWS RDS encryption at rest and in transit
- Apply principle of least privilege for database access
- Regular security scanning of database configurations
- Implement database firewall rules

### For API Gateway Security (1.x)
- Keep Kong updated with latest security patches
- Implement advanced rate limiting with sliding windows
- Use Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules
- Implement request signature validation
- Regular security audits of Kong configuration

### For Administrative Access (6.x)
- Implement multi-factor authentication for admin access
- Use AWS IAM roles with minimal permissions
- Regular vulnerability scanning of containers
- Implement container image signing
- Use AWS Systems Manager for secure administrative access

## 9. Summary of Findings

### Key Risks Identified

1. **API Key Management:** Current single API key authentication is vulnerable to compromise
2. **LLM Integration Risks:** Unfiltered prompts to ChatGPT pose injection and data leakage risks
3. **Database Exposure:** Potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in API and Control Plane
4. **Limited Input Validation:** Reliance on Kong filtering alone may be insufficient
5. **External Dependencies:** Trust relationships with Meal Planner apps and ChatGPT API

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Implement comprehensive input validation at application layer
   - Add prompt sanitization for ChatGPT interactions
   - Review and harden API key generation and storage

2. **Short-term Improvements:**
   - Deploy WAF in front of API Gateway
   - Implement database activity monitoring
   - Add output filtering for LLM responses

3. **Long-term Enhancements:**
   - Migrate to OAuth 2.0 or mutual TLS authentication
   - Implement zero-trust architecture principles
   - Deploy runtime application self-protection (RASP)

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

### Questions
1. What is the API key generation algorithm currently in use?
2. Are there any rate limits on ChatGPT API calls?
3. What logging and monitoring solutions are in place?
4. How are container images validated before deployment?
5. What is the disaster recovery plan for database compromise?

### Assumptions
1. API keys are stored securely by Meal Planner applications
2. TLS implementation uses current best practices (TLS 1.2+)
3. AWS RDS is configured with default security settings
4. No additional security layers beyond those mentioned in the architecture
5. Standard Golang HTTP libraries are used without additional hardening
6. Kong is configured with default plugins and settings
7. No runtime protection mechanisms are currently deployed
