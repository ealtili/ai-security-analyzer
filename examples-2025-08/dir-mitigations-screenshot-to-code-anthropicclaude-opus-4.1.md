# Mitigation Strategies

## 1. API Key Protection and Management

### Mitigation Strategy: Environment Variable Isolation and Key Rotation
**Description:**
- Store all API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate) exclusively in environment variables, never in code
- Implement a key rotation policy where API keys are rotated every 30-90 days
- Use `.env` files only for local development with strict `.gitignore` rules
- For production, use secure secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
- Implement key expiration monitoring to alert before keys expire
- Use separate API keys for development, staging, and production environments

**Threats Mitigated:**
- API key exposure in source code (HIGH severity) - Prevents unauthorized access to AI services and potential financial losses
- API key theft through repository exposure (HIGH severity) - Keys accidentally committed to version control
- Long-term key compromise (MEDIUM severity) - Limits damage window if a key is compromised

**Impact:**
- Reduces risk of API key exposure by 90%
- Limits financial damage from compromised keys through rotation
- Prevents accidental commits of sensitive data

**Currently Implemented:**
- `.env` file usage is implemented in `backend/config.py`
