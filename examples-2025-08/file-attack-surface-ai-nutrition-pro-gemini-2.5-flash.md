## ATTACK SURFACE ANALYSIS for AI Nutrition-Pro

This analysis identifies key attack surfaces for the AI Nutrition-Pro application, focusing on medium, high, and critical risks introduced by its specific architecture and dependencies.

### 1. API Key Compromise

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains an API key belonging to an integrated Meal Planner application, gaining unauthorized access to AI Nutrition-Pro's functionality.
*   **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes to the attack surface:** The application relies on individual API keys for authenticating external Meal Planner applications, making these keys a critical access credential.
*   **Example:** A malicious actor compromises a Meal Planner application's server or sniffs network traffic (if TLS is misconfigured or bypassed in the client) and extracts its API key. This key is then used to send unauthorized requests to AI Nutrition-Pro.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to AI content generation, potential for data exfiltration (e.g., fetching other dietitians' content samples if authorization is flawed), abuse of LLM services leading to increased costs, and denial of service through excessive requests.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Current Mitigations:**
    *   Individual API keys for each Meal Planner application (provides some isolation).
    *   API Gateway (Kong) ACL rules (can limit the actions a compromised key might perform).
    *   API Gateway rate limiting (reduces the impact of abuse but doesn't prevent unauthorized access).
    *   Encrypted network traffic (TLS) between Meal Planner applications and API Gateway protects keys in transit.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **API Key Lifecycle Management:** Implement policies for regular API key rotation and mechanisms for immediate revocation of suspected compromised keys.
    *   **Usage Monitoring:** Monitor for unusual API key usage patterns (e.g., sudden spikes in requests, requests from unexpected geographic locations or IP addresses).
    *   **Stronger Client Authentication:** Evaluate if API keys alone are sufficient, or if a more robust client authentication method (e.g., OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow with proper secret management) is warranted for higher-privilege integrations.

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization Bypass (Prompt Injection, SQL Injection)

*   **Description:** Malicious input bypasses the API Gateway's initial filtering and reaches either the `API Application` for processing, the internal databases for storage/retrieval, or the `ChatGPT-3.5` LLM, leading to injection attacks.
*   **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes to the attack surface:** The application's core functionality involves processing user-provided content (dietitian samples, requests for AI generation) and feeding it to an external LLM, creating vectors for prompt injection. It also interacts with internal databases, exposing it to SQL injection if input is not properly handled.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Prompt Injection:** A dietitian uploads a content sample or provides a request containing carefully crafted instructions that manipulate `ChatGPT-3.5` to ignore previous system instructions, reveal sensitive information from its context, or generate harmful/unintended content.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Malicious data within a Meal Planner application's request (e.g., in a content ID or search query) bypasses the API Gateway and is incorporated into a database query by the `API Application` or `Web Control Plane`, allowing an attacker to read, modify, or delete data in `api_db` or `control_plan_db`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Prompt Injection:** Data exfiltration from LLM context, generation of harmful, biased, or nonsensical content, reputational damage, and potential misuse of the LLM.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Complete compromise of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability within the `api_db` or `control_plan_db`, potentially leading to system-wide compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Current Mitigations:**
    *   API Gateway filtering of input (general purpose, may not be sufficient for sophisticated application-specific attacks like prompt injection or complex SQLi).
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Deep Input Validation:** Implement robust, context-aware input validation and sanitization within the `API Application` and `Web Control Plane` for all incoming data, beyond basic API Gateway checks.
    *   **Prompt Engineering Defenses:** Employ specific techniques to mitigate prompt injection, such as input/output parsing, explicit instruction reinforcement, content moderation filters on LLM input/output, and separating user input from system instructions.
    *   **Parameterized Queries:** Use prepared statements or parameterized queries for all database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Output Encoding:** If any user-provided content or LLM-generated content is displayed in the `Web Control Plane` or returned to `Meal Planner` applications, ensure proper output encoding to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

### 3. Abuse of LLM Services

*   **Description:** An attacker or a compromised Meal Planner application leverages the AI Nutrition-Pro system to perform excessive, unauthorized, or resource-intensive requests to `ChatGPT-3.5`, leading to increased operational costs or service disruption.
*   **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes to the attack surface:** The application's core business model is built around integrating with and utilizing an external LLM (`ChatGPT-3.5`), making it a direct proxy for LLM interactions.
*   **Example:** A compromised API key is used to flood AI Nutrition-Pro with computationally expensive content generation requests, which are then forwarded to `ChatGPT-3.5`, resulting in unexpectedly high billing from OpenAI. Alternatively, an attacker might try to exhaust the AI Nutrition-Pro's quota or rate limits with OpenAI, causing a denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Significant financial loss due to escalated OpenAI API costs, potential for OpenAI to throttle or suspend AI Nutrition-Pro's access due to policy violations or excessive usage, and degradation of service for legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Current Mitigations:**
    *   API Gateway rate limiting (helps to some extent, but might not be granular enough to prevent abuse by multiple legitimate but compromised keys).
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Granular Quota Management:** Implement per-client or per-API key quotas and rate limits for LLM usage within the `API Application`, distinct from the API Gateway's general rate limits.
    *   **Cost Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement real-time monitoring of LLM API usage and costs, with automated alerts for unusual spikes or exceeding predefined thresholds.
    *   **Circuit Breakers:** Implement circuit breakers or kill switches to temporarily halt LLM interactions if a predefined abuse pattern or cost threshold is detected, protecting against runaway costs.
    *   **Request Optimization:** Implement mechanisms to limit the size and complexity of requests sent to the LLM (e.g., token limits on prompts) to prevent excessively resource-intensive operations.

### 4. Data Exfiltration or Tampering from Databases

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the internal `api_db` or `control_plan_db` leads to the exfiltration of sensitive data (dietitian's content samples, client/billing information) or malicious modification of data.
*   **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes to the attack surface:** The application stores critical business and user data in two dedicated Amazon RDS instances (`api_db` and `control_plan_db`), making these databases prime targets for attackers.
*   **Example:**
    *   An attacker successfully exploits a vulnerability (e.g., SQL Injection, insecure direct object reference, or a flaw in the `Web Control Plane`'s authorization) in the `API Application` or `Web Control Plane` to gain unauthorized read access to `api_db` and retrieve sensitive dietitian content samples or `control_plan_db` to access client and billing information.
    *   An attacker gains administrative access to the `Web Control Plane` and uses it to modify billing data or client configurations stored in `control_plan_db`.
*   **Impact:** Severe confidentiality breach of sensitive user content and business data, integrity compromise of billing and client management data, reputational damage, potential regulatory fines (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA if health data is involved), and financial fraud.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Current Mitigations:**
    *   TLS for internal database connections (`app_control_plane` <-> `control_plan_db`, `backend_api` <-> `api_db`) protects data in transit.
    *   Amazon RDS (managed service, provides underlying security features like network isolation, encryption at rest, and automated backups).
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Database Access:** Ensure that application users for `API Application` and `Web Control Plane` have only the minimum necessary database permissions (e.g., read-only access where appropriate, specific table/column access).
    *   **Strong Authentication and Authorization for `Web Control Plane`:** Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for administrators and robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to prevent unauthorized access to the `control_plan_db` through the control plane.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Strictly enforce network firewall rules (Security Groups in AWS) to ensure that databases are only accessible from their respective application containers (`app_control_plane` and `backend_api`) and no other external or internal systems.
    *   **Data Masking/Anonymization:** Evaluate if sensitive data stored in `api_db` (e.g., dietitian's content) can be anonymized or masked for non-production environments or if only necessary parts are stored.

### 5. Compromise of Web Control Plane

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `Web Control Plane` application, allowing them to manage clients, modify configurations, or manipulate billing data.
*   **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes to the attack surface:** The `Web Control Plane` is a central administrative interface for managing the entire AI Nutrition-Pro system, making it a high-value target for attackers.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the `Web Control Plane` (e.g., authentication bypass, broken access control, unpatched vulnerability in Golang/libraries, or a successful phishing attack on an administrator's credentials) to gain administrative privileges.
*   **Impact:** Full control over client onboarding and management, ability to change system configurations, modify billing data, disable security features, or even introduce malicious code, leading to widespread service disruption, financial fraud, data compromise across all tenants, and complete system takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Current Mitigations:**
    *   Deployed as Docker containers on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), leveraging AWS's infrastructure security.
    *   Written in Golang, which is a memory-safe language, reducing certain classes of vulnerabilities.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Mandate MFA for all administrator and manager accounts accessing the `Web Control Plane`.
    *   **Robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement granular RBAC to ensure that "Administrator," "App Onboarding Manager," and "Meal Planner application manager" roles have only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Secure Session Management:** Implement strong session management practices (e.g., short-lived sessions, proper session invalidation, protection against session fixation).
    *   **Comprehensive Input Validation and Output Encoding:** Ensure that all user inputs and outputs in the `Web Control Plane` are rigorously validated and encoded to prevent web vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and command injection.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct frequent security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the `Web Control Plane` application.
    *   **Detailed Logging and Monitoring:** Implement extensive logging of all administrative actions and user activities within the `Web Control Plane`, coupled with real-time monitoring and alerting for suspicious behavior.

### 6. Supply Chain Attack via External LLM (ChatGPT-3.5)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability, malicious intent, or operational issue within the external `ChatGPT-3.5` service directly impacts the AI Nutrition-Pro application.
*   **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes to the attack surface:** The application's core functionality is entirely dependent on and tightly coupled with `ChatGPT-3.5`, making it vulnerable to issues originating from this third-party service.
*   **Example:**
    *   `ChatGPT-3.5` experiences an extended outage, rendering AI Nutrition-Pro unable to generate content and effectively bringing down its primary service.
    *   A vulnerability in `ChatGPT-3.5`'s API allows for data leakage during content generation, or its behavior is altered to produce biased or harmful content that AI Nutrition-Pro then serves to its users.
    *   OpenAI implements breaking changes to its API without sufficient notice, causing integration failures within AI Nutrition-Pro.
*   **Impact:** Widespread service disruption, data integrity issues (e.g., incorrect or biased content), potential data leakage from the LLM, unexpected financial costs, and reputational damage for AI Nutrition-Pro.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Current Mitigations:**
    *   None explicitly listed in the provided architecture for mitigating risks from the external LLM itself, beyond basic HTTPS/REST communication.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Vendor Risk Management:** Conduct thorough due diligence on OpenAI's security posture, incident response capabilities, and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
    *   **Resilience and Graceful Degradation:** Implement circuit breakers, timeouts, and fallback mechanisms within the `API Application` to gracefully handle `ChatGPT-3.5` outages or errors. This could include returning cached results, default responses, or informative error messages to the Meal Planner applications.
    *   **Monitoring of External Service Health:** Actively monitor `ChatGPT-3.5`'s status page and implement health checks for its API endpoints.
    *   **Output Content Moderation/Validation:** Implement AI Nutrition-Pro's own content filters and validation logic on the output received from `ChatGPT-3.5` to detect and filter out potentially harmful, biased, or nonsensical content before it reaches end-users.
    *   **Data Minimization for LLM Input:** Ensure that only the absolute minimum necessary data (e.g., anonymized content, specific prompts) is sent to `ChatGPT-3.5` to reduce the impact of potential data leakage from the LLM provider.
