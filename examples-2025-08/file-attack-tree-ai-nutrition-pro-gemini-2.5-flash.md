## Threat Modeling Analysis for AI Nutrition-Pro Application Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

### Overview

The AI Nutrition-Pro application is a cloud-native service designed to provide AI-powered content generation, primarily for Meal Planner applications. It leverages an external Large Language Model (LLM), ChatGPT-3.5, to create content (e.g., diet introductions) based on dietitian-provided samples. The application also features a separate Web Control Plane for managing clients, configurations, and billing data, accessible by an Administrator.

### Key Components and Features

*   **API Gateway (Kong)**: Handles authentication (via API keys for Meal Planner apps), authorization (ACL rules), rate limiting, and input filtering for incoming requests from Meal Planner applications.
*   **API Application (`backend_api`)**: The core AI functionality written in Golang, deployed on AWS ECS. It processes requests, interacts with ChatGPT-3.5, and stores dietitian content samples, LLM requests, and responses in the `API database`.
*   **API Database (`api_db`)**: An Amazon RDS instance storing content samples, LLM interactions, and other data for the `backend_api`.
*   **Web Control Plane (`app_control_plane`)**: A Golang application deployed on AWS ECS, providing an interface for administrators to onboard and manage clients, configure system properties, and check billing data. It operates in three roles: Administrator, App Onboarding Manager, and Meal Planner application manager.
*   **Control Plane Database (`control_plan_db`)**: An Amazon RDS instance storing data related to the control plane, including tenant information, billing data, and configurations.
*   **Administrator**: A human user responsible for managing the AI Nutrition-Pro application.

### Dependencies

*   **Meal Planner Application (`mealApp`)**: An external web application that integrates with AI Nutrition-Pro via REST/HTTPS. It uploads content samples and fetches AI-generated results.
*   **ChatGPT-3.5 (`chatgpt`)**: An external OpenAI LLM used by the `backend_api` for content generation.
*   **AWS Services**: Elastic Container Service (ECS) for deploying Golang applications, Amazon RDS for databases.
*   **Kong**: API Gateway for managing API traffic.
*   **Golang**: Programming language used for `backend_api` and `app_control_plane`.

## 2. Define the Root Goal of the Attack Tree

**Attacker's Ultimate Objective**: Compromise AI Nutrition-Pro application or its integrated systems to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or disrupt service by exploiting weaknesses in AI Nutrition-Pro's design, implementation, or configuration.

## 3. Identify High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)

1.  **Compromise API-facing components and data**: Target the entry points for external clients, the core AI functionality, and its associated data.
2.  **Compromise Control Plane components and data**: Target the administrative interface and its critical configuration and tenant data.
3.  **Disrupt Overall Service Availability**: Prevent legitimate users from accessing AI Nutrition-Pro services.
4.  **Supply Chain / Infrastructure Compromise**: Exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure or dependencies as a result of AI Nutrition-Pro's choices or configurations.

## 4. Expand Each Attack Path with Detailed Steps

### 1. Compromise API-facing components and data

This path focuses on attacks against the API Gateway, the `backend_api`, the `api_db`, and the integration with `chatgpt`, primarily originating from a `Meal Planner` application or an attacker impersonating one.

### 2. Compromise Control Plane components and data

This path targets the `app_control_plane` and `control_plan_db`, aiming to gain administrative access, manipulate system configurations, or exfiltrate sensitive tenant and billing data.

### 3. Disrupt Overall Service Availability

This path focuses on preventing legitimate users (Meal Planner applications or administrators) from accessing AI Nutrition-Pro services, either through resource exhaustion or specific denial-of-service vulnerabilities.

### 4. Supply Chain / Infrastructure Compromise

This path covers attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the foundational technologies (AWS, Golang dependencies) as a direct result of how AI Nutrition-Pro uses or configures them.

## 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

### High-Risk Paths

The following attack paths are considered high-risk due to a combination of high likelihood and critical impact, or relatively low effort/skill for high impact:

*   **1.2.2.1 Prompt Injection to `chatgpt` via `backend_api` input**:
    *   **Justification**: This is a direct consequence of integrating an LLM and is a rapidly evolving threat. It has a high likelihood because it exploits the inherent nature of LLMs, and a high impact as it can manipulate AI output, potentially leading to the generation of harmful content, data leakage from the LLM context, or reputational damage for AI Nutrition-Pro and the Meal Planner applications. The effort and skill required can be surprisingly low.
*   **2.1.1.2 Steal admin credentials (e.g., phishing)**:
    *   **Justification**: Social engineering attacks like phishing are highly common and effective. If an Administrator's credentials are stolen, the attacker gains full control over the `app_control_plane`, leading to critical impact (data breach, system manipulation, service disruption).
*   **2.1.3.4 Remote Code Execution (RCE) on `app_control_plane` or 1.2.1.2 RCE on `backend_api`**:
    *   **Justification**: While often requiring higher skill and effort, successful RCE grants an attacker complete control over the application server, leading to critical impact (data exfiltration, system manipulation, lateral movement). The likelihood is medium because modern Go applications might have fewer common RCE vectors, but vulnerable dependencies or custom logic can introduce them. Detection is also difficult.
*   **2.2.2.2 Read/Write sensitive data (tenant data, billing information, system configurations) from `control_plan_db`**:
    *   **Justification**: Once access to the `control_plan_db` is achieved (via `app_control_plane` compromise or direct DB exploit), the impact is critical, leading to a massive data breach, financial fraud, and severe reputational damage. The likelihood is high *if* the preceding steps are successful, and the effort to exfiltrate data at that point is low.
*   **1.1.1.1 Steal API Key from Meal Planner application**:
    *   **Justification**: Compromising a `Meal Planner` application to steal its API key allows an attacker to impersonate that client, gaining unauthorized access to AI Nutrition-Pro's API. This has a high impact on the individual `Meal Planner` and potentially on AI Nutrition-Pro (e.g., for generating malicious content, exhausting quotas). Likelihood is medium as it depends on the security posture of external systems.
*   **3.3.1 Generate excessive AI content requests via `backend_api` / 3.3.2 Use stolen `chatgpt` API key for external abuse**:
    *   **Justification**: This can lead to significant financial cost for AI Nutrition-Pro due to excessive LLM usage and can disrupt service availability by exhausting the `chatgpt` API quota. This is a direct financial and operational risk tied to the LLM integration.

### Critical Nodes

Addressing these nodes would significantly reduce overall risk:

*   **Robust authentication and authorization for `app_control_plane` (2.1.1 & 2.1.2)**: This is the administrative heart of the system. Strong MFA, session management, and granular role-based access control are paramount.
*   **Input sanitization and validation for `backend_api` (1.2.1.1 & 1.2.2.1)**: Especially important for inputs that will be passed to the LLM or used in database queries. This directly mitigates SQL Injection and Prompt Injection.
*   **Secure management of API Keys (1.1.1.3 & 1.4.1)**: For both `Meal Planner` applications and the `chatgpt` integration. This includes secure generation, storage, rotation, and revocation.
*   **Least privilege for AWS IAM roles and network access (1.3.1, 2.2.1, 4.1)**: Misconfigurations here can provide direct access to databases or allow lateral movement within the AWS environment.
*   **Comprehensive rate limiting at API Gateway and internally (1.1.1.2.2, 3.1.1, 3.3.1)**: Essential for mitigating DoS attacks and preventing abuse of LLM resources.

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies

### General Mitigations for AI Nutrition-Pro

*   **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)**: Implement security best practices throughout the development, testing, and deployment phases.
*   **Dependency Management**: Regularly audit and update Golang dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning & Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular security assessments against all components.
*   **Logging, Monitoring & Alerting**: Implement comprehensive logging for all components, monitor for suspicious activities, and set up alerts for critical events (e.g., failed logins, unusual API usage, RCE attempts).

### Specific Mitigations for Identified Threats

1.  **API-facing Components and Data (API Gateway, Backend API, API DB, ChatGPT)**
    *   **API Key Security (1.1.1, 1.4.1)**:
        *   **Implement strong API Key generation**: Ensure keys are long, random, and not easily guessable.
        *   **Secure API Key storage**: Advise Meal Planner applications on secure storage practices and never expose keys in client-side code, logs, or UI.
        *   **Robust API Key revocation**: Provide a clear, efficient mechanism for Meal Planner applications and administrators to revoke compromised API keys immediately.
        *   **Internal API Key Management**: Store `chatgpt` API keys securely (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, environment variables with strict access control) and rotate them regularly.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization (1.1.1, 1.1.2)**:
        *   **Strict ACL rules**: Implement granular ACLs at the API Gateway (Kong) following the principle of least privilege. Regularly review and test these rules for misconfigurations.
        *   **Rate Limiting**: Configure aggressive rate limiting on the API Gateway to prevent brute-force attacks on API keys and DoS attempts. Implement internal rate limits for `chatgpt` calls to prevent quota exhaustion.
    *   **Input Filtering & Sanitization (1.1.3, 1.2.1.1, 1.2.2.1)**:
        *   **API Gateway WAF**: Ensure Kong's input filtering is robust and regularly updated to detect and block common attack patterns (SQLi, XSS, RCE payloads).
        *   **Backend API Input Validation**: Implement strict, contextual input validation and sanitization in the `backend_api` for all user-supplied data, especially before database interactions (SQL Injection prevention using prepared statements/ORMs) and before sending prompts to `chatgpt` (Prompt Injection prevention).
        *   **Prompt Injection Mitigation**: Explore techniques like prompt engineering (e.g., adding explicit instructions to the LLM to ignore conflicting instructions), input/output filtering (e.g., using a separate model to check for malicious prompts/outputs), and restricting LLM capabilities.
    *   **Database Security (`api_db` - 1.3)**:
        *   **Least Privilege Database Access**: Ensure `backend_api` connects to `api_db` with the absolute minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Network Segmentation**: Restrict `api_db` access to only the `backend_api` ECS tasks via strict AWS Security Group rules and private subnets. Never expose RDS publicly.
        *   **Strong Credentials**: Use strong, rotated credentials for database access.

2.  **Control Plane Components and Data (Web Control Plane, Control Plane DB)**
    *   **Administrator Access Control (2.1.1, 2.1.2)**:
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA for all `app_control_plane` administrator logins.
        *   **Strong Password Policies**: Mandate strong, unique passwords and regular rotation.
        *   **Session Management**: Implement secure session management (e.g., short session timeouts, secure cookies).
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement granular RBAC to ensure administrators (and other roles) only have access to the functionalities required for their job.
        *   **Admin Activity Monitoring**: Log and alert on all administrative actions and failed login attempts.
    *   **Web Vulnerability Prevention (2.1.3)**:
        *   **OWASP Top 10 Best Practices**: Implement robust defenses against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, CSRF, SSRF, RCE). This includes input validation, output encoding, use of secure frameworks, and parameterized queries for database interactions.
        *   **Secure File Uploads**: If `app_control_plane` allows file uploads, implement strict validation (type, size), virus scanning, and store files outside the web root.
    *   **Database Security (`control_plan_db` - 2.2)**:
        *   **Same as `api_db`**: Apply least privilege, network segmentation, strong credentials, and encryption for `control_plan_db`.

3.  **Service Availability (DoS)**
    *   **Rate Limiting & Throttling (3.1, 3.2, 3.3)**:
        *   **API Gateway (Kong)**: Configure robust rate limiting, burst limits, and circuit breakers.
        *   **Internal Application Logic**: Implement application-level rate limiting and request queueing for computationally intensive tasks within `backend_api` and `app_control_plane`.
        *   **LLM Quota Management**: Monitor `chatgpt` API usage closely and implement circuit breakers or back-off strategies to prevent accidental or malicious quota exhaustion.
    *   **Resource Scaling**: Utilize AWS ECS auto-scaling to dynamically adjust resources based on demand, mitigating some DoS attempts.

4.  **Supply Chain / Infrastructure Compromise**
    *   **AWS IAM Best Practices (4.1.1)**:
        *   **Least Privilege IAM Roles**: Configure IAM roles for ECS tasks (`backend_api`, `app_control_plane`) with the absolute minimum permissions required. Avoid using root accounts or long-lived access keys.
        *   **Regular IAM Audits**: Periodically review IAM policies and access logs.
    *   **AWS Network Security (4.1.2)**:
        *   **Strict Security Groups**: Configure security groups to allow only necessary inbound/outbound traffic between components. Ensure databases are in private subnets.
        *   **VPC Flow Logs**: Enable and monitor VPC Flow Logs for unusual network traffic patterns.
    *   **Dependency Security (4.2)**:
        *   **Dependency Scanning**: Use tools (e.g., `go mod audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) to automatically scan Golang dependencies for known vulnerabilities (CVEs).
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: Regularly perform SCA to identify and update vulnerable libraries.
        *   **Supply Chain Integrity**: Verify the authenticity of third-party libraries (e.g., by checking checksums, using trusted registries).

1.  **Prompt Injection**: The core functionality of LLM integration introduces a high-likelihood, high-impact risk of manipulating AI output, leading to misinformation, harmful content generation, or unintended data leakage.
2.  **Administrative Plane Compromise**: The `app_control_plane` is a critical target. Weak authentication, authorization, or common web vulnerabilities (like RCE or SQLi) can lead to full system control, exposing tenant data, billing information, and allowing manipulation of system configurations.
3.  **API Key Management**: Reliance on API keys for `Meal Planner` authentication introduces risks of key theft, brute-forcing, or weak management, allowing impersonation and unauthorized API usage.
4.  **Misconfiguration of Cloud Resources**: Overly permissive IAM roles or network security group settings can expose critical databases or allow lateral movement, leading to data breaches or service disruption.
5.  **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Inadequate rate limiting or resource management, especially concerning LLM API calls, can lead to significant financial costs and service unavailability.

### Recommended Actions

1.  **Prioritize Prompt Injection Mitigation**: Implement robust input filtering, sanitization, and explore advanced prompt engineering techniques for all user-supplied content before it reaches ChatGPT. Consider using LLM firewalls or guardrails.
2.  **Harden the Web Control Plane**: Implement MFA for all administrative users, enforce strict RBAC, regularly audit access, and rigorously test the `app_control_plane` for common web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, RCE, IDOR).
3.  **Strengthen API Key Lifecycle Management**: Develop secure API key generation, distribution, rotation, and immediate revocation mechanisms. Educate `Meal Planner` clients on secure API key handling.
4.  **Implement Principle of Least Privilege**: Apply this across all AWS IAM roles, database user permissions, and network security group configurations. Regularly audit these settings.
5.  **Enhance Rate Limiting and Resource Management**: Implement comprehensive rate limiting at the API Gateway and within the `backend_api` for LLM calls. Monitor `chatgpt` API usage and costs to detect and prevent abuse.
6.  **Regular Security Testing**: Conduct frequent vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and security code reviews for both `backend_api` and `app_control_plane` (Golang applications). Pay special attention to third-party dependencies.

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

### Questions

*   What are the specific roles and permissions within the `Web Control Plane` beyond "Administrator"? Are there "App Onboarding Manager" and "Meal Planner application manager" roles, and how are their privileges segmented?
*   What is the process for generating, distributing, and revoking API keys for `Meal Planner` applications? Is there an automated system for this, or is it manual?
*   How are `chatgpt` API keys stored and accessed by the `backend_api`?
*   Are there any logging, monitoring, or alerting solutions already in place for the application and its AWS infrastructure?
*   What is the chosen database driver/ORM for Golang applications interacting with Amazon RDS? (This impacts SQLi vulnerability likelihood).
*   Does the `backend_api` or `app_control_plane` handle any file uploads or external command execution?
*   Is there any internal mechanism to limit the number of `chatgpt` requests per `Meal Planner` application or per time unit?

### Assumptions

*   The `Administrator` role has full control over the `app_control_plane` and can modify critical system configurations.
*   Network traffic within the AWS environment (between ECS containers and RDS instances) is also secured with TLS, similar to the external traffic to the API Gateway.
*   The `Meal Planner` applications are external entities whose security is not directly controlled by AI Nutrition-Pro, but their compromise can impact AI Nutrition-Pro via API key theft.
*   The `backend_api` and `app_control_plane` are Golang applications that could be susceptible to common web application vulnerabilities if not coded securely.
*   OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 itself is considered a trusted external system, and attacks focus on how AI Nutrition-Pro interacts with it, not on compromising OpenAI's infrastructure.
*   The `API Gateway` (Kong) is configured and managed by the AI Nutrition-Pro team, and its security posture depends on their configuration choices and maintenance.
*   The described "filtering of input" by the API Gateway is a form of Web Application Firewall (WAF) functionality, but its effectiveness is dependent on its configuration.
