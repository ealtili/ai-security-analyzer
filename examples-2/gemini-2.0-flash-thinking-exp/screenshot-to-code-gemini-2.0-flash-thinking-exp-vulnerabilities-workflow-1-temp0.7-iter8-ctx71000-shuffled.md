## Combined Vulnerability List

### 1. Unintended Exposure of Mock LLM Responses in Production

- **Description:**
    The backend application uses an environment variable `MOCK` to control whether to use mock LLM responses. When `MOCK` is set to `true`, the backend utilizes mock LLM responses instead of calling external LLM APIs. If `MOCK` is mistakenly set to `true` in a production deployment, the application will serve static, pre-defined responses. An external attacker interacting with the publicly accessible application will receive these mock responses, expecting AI-generated code. This exposes internal application behavior, including sample code snippets, logic, and potentially sensitive placeholder content intended only for development and testing purposes.

    1.  The backend application checks the `MOCK` environment variable.
    2.  If `MOCK` is set to `true`, the application logic in `backend/llm.py` and `backend/routes/generate_code.py` will use mock responses from `backend/mock_llm.py`.
    3.  These mock responses are static, pre-defined code snippets intended for development and testing.
    4.  In a production environment with `MOCK=true`, all users will receive these mock responses.
    5.  An attacker observing these responses can gain insights into the application's internal workings and mock data.

- **Impact:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** Mock responses can reveal internal application structure, features under development, example code implementations, and comments intended for internal use. This information can aid an attacker in understanding the application's inner workings, potentially facilitating further attacks.
    - **Misleading Functionality:** Users will experience misleading outputs that do not reflect the application's advertised AI-powered capabilities. This can erode user trust and negatively impact the perceived value of the application.
    - **Reduced Security Posture:** While not a direct breach, exposure of mock responses weakens the security posture by leaking internal details, which, when combined with other vulnerabilities, could assist an attacker in more effectively targeting the system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The application utilizes environment variables for configuration, which is a standard practice.
    - The `MOCK` variable is intended for development and debugging, indicating an awareness to separate testing from production.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Production Environment Check & Enforcement:** The application lacks a mechanism to detect if it's running in a production environment and enforce that `MOCK` is set to `false` or unset. A startup check could verify the environment and issue a warning or refuse to start if `MOCK=true` in production.
    - **Startup Warning/Error Logging:** There is no logging or warning message at application startup to indicate if the application is running in mock mode. This would immediately alert administrators to a misconfiguration.
    - **Explicit Documentation Warning:** While the README might mention mock mode, it should include a clear and prominent warning against enabling mock mode in production, explicitly outlining the security risks and information disclosure implications.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The application is deployed in a production environment.
    - The `MOCK` environment variable is unintentionally or maliciously set to `true`.
    - An external attacker interacts with the publicly accessible frontend of the application.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`backend/config.py`:**
        ```python
        SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE = bool(os.environ.get("MOCK", False))
        ```
        This line reads the `MOCK` environment variable and sets `SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE` to `True` if `MOCK` is truthy, `False` otherwise.

    2. **`backend/llm.py`:**
        ```python
        from config import SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE
        from backend.mock_llm import mock_completion
        # ...
        async def get_completion_streaming(...):
            if SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE:
                return await mock_completion(process_chunk, input_mode)
            # ... rest of the function that calls actual LLM APIs
        ```
        This code block shows that `SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE` directly controls whether mock responses are used.

    3. **`backend/mock_llm.py`:**
        This file contains static mock responses like `APPLE_MOCK_CODE`, `NYTIMES_MOCK_CODE`, which are served when `SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE` is `True`.

    4. **`backend/routes/generate_code.py`:**
        ```python
        from config import SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE
        from mock_llm import mock_completion
        # ...
        if SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE:
            completion_results = [
                await mock_completion(process_chunk, input_mode=input_mode)
            ]
            completions = [result["code"] for result in completion_results]
        else:
            # ... code to call actual LLM APIs ...
        ```
        This code snippet in the `stream_code` route confirms the usage of `SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE` to choose between mock and real LLM responses.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Environment Variable MOCK=true --> backend/config.py (SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE = True) --> backend/llm.py or backend/routes/generate_code.py (if SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE: use mock_completion) --> backend/mock_llm.py (serve static mock code) --> User receives mock code instead of AI generated code
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Deploy the application in a test or staging environment mirroring production.
    2. **Action:** Set the environment variable `MOCK` to `true` during backend deployment.
    3. **Action:** Access the publicly available frontend of the application.
    4. **Action:** Interact with the application to generate code (e.g., upload screenshot, provide URL).
    5. **Verification:** Examine the generated code output. Confirm it matches pre-defined mock code snippets in `backend/mock_llm.py` (e.g., `NYTIMES_MOCK_CODE`). The output should be static across different inputs.
    6. **Expected Result:** The application serves static mock code due to `MOCK=true`, demonstrating unintended exposure of mock responses in a production-like environment.

### 2. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Screenshot Capture

- **Description:**
    The application is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the screenshot capture feature. An attacker can send a crafted POST request to the `/api/screenshot` endpoint with a malicious URL in the `url` parameter. The backend application, specifically in `backend/routes/screenshot.py`, uses the `capture_screenshot` function to take a screenshot of the provided URL via the `screenshotone.com` API. Because user-provided URLs are not validated, an attacker can supply a URL pointing to internal network resources (e.g., `http://localhost:7001/api/home`, `http://192.168.1.1`) or external services. This causes the backend server, through `screenshotone.com`, to make requests to these unintended destinations.

    1.  An attacker sends a POST request to `/api/screenshot` with a JSON payload.
    2.  The JSON payload includes a `url` parameter containing a malicious URL (e.g., `http://localhost:7001/api/status`).
    3.  The backend extracts the `url` and passes it to the `capture_screenshot` function in `backend/routes/screenshot.py`.
    4.  The `capture_screenshot` function constructs a request to `screenshotone.com` API, including the attacker-controlled `url` as a parameter.
    5.  `screenshotone.com` makes a GET request to the attacker-specified `url`.
    6.  If the `url` points to an internal resource accessible from the backend's network, `screenshotone.com` may access it.
    7.  The response from `screenshotone.com` (potentially containing content from the internal resource) is returned to the attacker as a screenshot data URL.

- **Impact:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive information from internal network resources or the application server itself by making `screenshotone.com` fetch them and return a screenshot. This includes internal APIs, configuration files, or services.
    - **Internal Network Scanning:** The server can be used to scan internal ports and services by observing connection timeouts or different responses when probing various internal IPs and ports.
    - **Further Exploitation:** SSRF can be a stepping stone for more complex attacks if internal services are exposed and vulnerable.
    - **Data Exfiltration (potentially):** If internal services return sensitive data, this data could be captured in the screenshot and exposed.
    - **Abuse of external services (potentially):** An attacker could make requests to external services via `screenshotone.com`, potentially abusing those services.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The application directly uses the user-provided URL without any validation or sanitization before passing it to the `screenshotone.com` API.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input validation and sanitization:** Implement strict validation of the `target_url` to ensure it points to external, safe web resources and not to internal or restricted addresses. A whitelist of allowed protocols (e.g., `http`, `https`) and domain patterns could be used.
    - **URL Allowlisting:** Define an allowlist of permitted domains or URL patterns that the screenshot service is allowed to access. Reject requests targeting URLs outside this allowlist.
    - **URL scheme and destination restrictions**: Restrict the URL schemes allowed to `http` and `https` and consider using a blocklist or denylist to prevent access to internal network ranges (e.g., private IP ranges, localhost).
    - **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the screenshot service and backend components from internal networks to limit the potential impact of SSRF.
    - **Error handling**: Implement proper error handling to prevent leakage of sensitive information in error responses if the screenshot service encounters issues when accessing internal resources.
    - **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on the `/api/screenshot` endpoint to reduce the ability of an attacker to perform large-scale scanning of internal resources.
    - **Principle of least privilege:** Ensure that the `screenshotone.com` API key used has the minimum necessary permissions.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must be deployed and publicly accessible.
    - The `/api/screenshot` endpoint must be exposed.
    - The ScreenshotOne API key must be configured and functional in the backend.
    - An attacker needs to have network access to the application and knowledge of the `/api/screenshot` endpoint.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `backend/routes/screenshot.py`

    ```python
    async def capture_screenshot(
        target_url: str, api_key: str, device: str = "desktop"
    ) -> bytes:
        api_base_url = "https://api.screenshotone.com/take"
        params = {
            "access_key": api_key,
            "url": target_url, # [VULNERABILITY] User-controlled input is directly passed as 'url' parameter.
            ...
        }
        async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=60) as client:
            response = await client.get(api_base_url, params=params) # httpx.get makes a request to screenshotone.com, but the 'url' is from user input.
            if response.status_code == 200 and response.content:
                return response.content
            else:
                raise Exception("Error taking screenshot")

    @router.post("/api/screenshot")
    async def app_screenshot(request: ScreenshotRequest):
        url = request.url # User-provided URL from request body
        api_key = request.apiKey
        image_bytes = await capture_screenshot(url, api_key=api_key) # capture_screenshot is called with user-provided URL.
        data_url = bytes_to_data_url(image_bytes, "image/png")
        return ScreenshotResponse(url=data_url)
    ```
    - The `app_screenshot` function takes the `url` from `ScreenshotRequest` without validation.
    - The `capture_screenshot` function uses this `target_url` directly in a `httpx.get` request to `screenshotone.com`.
    - This flow allows an attacker to control `target_url` and perform SSRF attacks.

        ScreenshotOne API->>Internal Resource: GET http://internal-resource
        alt internal-resource is accessible
            Internal Resource-->>ScreenshotOne API: Response from internal resource
            ScreenshotOne API->>Backend Server: Response with screenshot of internal resource
            Backend Server->>Attacker: Response {url: "data:image/png;base64,..."}
        else internal-resource is not accessible
            ScreenshotOne API-->>Backend Server: Error response
            Backend Server->>Attacker: Error response
        end
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Deploy** the application to a publicly accessible instance.
    2. **Prepare Malicious URL:** e.g., `http://localhost:7001/api/status` to target the application's status endpoint.
    3. **Send POST Request:** Use `curl` or Postman to send a POST request to `/api/screenshot` with the following JSON payload (replace `YOUR_SCREENSHOTONE_API_KEY`):
        ```json
        {
            "url": "http://localhost:7001/api/status",
            "apiKey": "YOUR_SCREENSHOTONE_API_KEY"
        }
        ```
        ```bash
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "http://localhost:7001/api/status", "apiKey": "YOUR_SCREENSHOTONE_API_KEY"}' http://<YOUR_APPLICATION_URL>/api/screenshot
        ```
    4. **Observe Response:** If vulnerable, the response will contain a data URL representing a screenshot. Decode the base64 data URL to view the screenshot. If it contains content from `http://localhost:7001/api/status`, SSRF is confirmed.
    5. **Test Internal Resources:** Try accessing other internal resources (e.g., `http://localhost:7001/evals`) or private IPs (e.g., `http://192.168.1.1`) to further explore the scope of SSRF.

### 3. Local File Inclusion (LFI) / Path Traversal in Evals Endpoints

- **Description:**
    The application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) or Path Traversal in the `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, and `/best-of-n-evals` endpoints. An attacker can manipulate the `folder`, `folder1`, `folder2`, etc., parameters in GET requests to these endpoints to access files and directories outside the intended evaluation directories. This is possible because the application uses user-provided folder paths directly in file system operations like `os.listdir` and `open` without proper validation or sanitization. By crafting malicious folder paths with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `../../`), an attacker can navigate up the directory tree and access sensitive files or directories on the server's filesystem.

    1.  An attacker sends a GET request to `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, or `/best-of-n-evals`.
    2.  The request includes query parameters like `folder`, `folder1`, or `folder2` with a malicious path, e.g., `folder=../../../`.
    3.  The backend in `backend/routes/evals.py` extracts these folder paths.
    4.  Functions like `get_evals`, `get_pairwise_evals`, and `get_best_of_n_evals` use `os.listdir` and `open` with these user-controlled, unsanitized folder paths.
    5.  Due to path traversal sequences, `os.listdir` and `open` can operate outside the intended evaluation directories.
    6.  This allows an attacker to list files and potentially read the content of arbitrary files accessible to the application user.

- **Impact:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could read arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially exposing sensitive data, credentials, configuration files, or source code.
    - **Server Compromise:** In severe cases, if sensitive configuration files or executable scripts are exposed, this vulnerability could be a stepping stone to further compromise the server.
    - **Unauthorized File System Access:** Gain unauthorized information about the server's file system structure and content.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly uses user-provided folder paths in file system operations without any sanitization or validation to prevent path traversal.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input validation and sanitization**: Implement robust validation on the `folder`, `folder1`, `folder2`, etc. parameters in the `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, and `/best-of-n-evals` endpoints. Sanitize the input paths to remove path traversal sequences and ensure that the paths are within the expected evaluation directories.
        - **Whitelist approach**: Define a whitelist of allowed base directories for evaluations and ensure that the provided folder paths are within these allowed directories.
        - **Path sanitization**: Sanitize the input paths to remove path traversal sequences like `../` and `..\\`. Use functions like `os.path.abspath` and `os.path.normpath` to resolve paths and check if they are still within the allowed base directories.
    - **Path normalization:** Normalize the input paths to resolve symbolic links and canonicalize the path, making it harder for attackers to use path traversal techniques.
    - **Restrict file access**: Ensure that the application user has minimal necessary file system permissions, limiting the impact of potential LFI vulnerabilities.
    - **Filesystem access control:** Implement proper filesystem access controls to limit the application's ability to access sensitive files, even if a path traversal vulnerability exists.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must be deployed and publicly accessible.
    - The `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, or `/best-of-n-evals` endpoints must be exposed.
    - An attacker needs to have network access to the application and knowledge of these endpoints.
    - The server's file system must contain sensitive files accessible to the user running the backend application.

        if not folders:
            return {"error": "No folders provided"}
        for folder in folders: # Looping through unsanitized 'folder' parameters
            if not os.path.exists(folder): # os.path.exists is used with unsanitized 'folder'
                return {"error": f"Folder does not exist: {folder}"}
        evals: list[Eval] = []
        files_by_folder = []
        for folder in folders: # Looping through unsanitized 'folder' parameters
            files = {
                f: os.path.join(folder, f) # os.path.join is used with unsanitized 'folder'
                for f in os.listdir(folder) # os.listdir is used with unsanitized 'folder'
                if f.endswith(".html")
            }
            files_by_folder.append(files)
        # ... rest of the code ...
    ```
    - The `get_evals`, `get_pairwise_evals`, and `get_best_of_n_evals` functions take folder paths as input parameters without validation.
    - They use `os.path.join` and `os.listdir` with these user-provided paths, enabling path traversal.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Deploy** the application to a publicly accessible instance.
    2. **Craft Malicious URL:** Prepare a URL to exploit path traversal, e.g., to list root directory:  `http://<your-app-url>/evals?folder=../../../`. To attempt reading `/etc/passwd`: `http://<your-app-url>/evals?folder=../../../../../../../../etc/`.
    3. **Send GET Request:** Use a browser or `curl` to send the crafted GET request. For example:
        ```bash
        curl "http://<your-app-url>/evals?folder=../../../"
        ```
    4. **Observe Response:** Check the server's response. Look for error messages or unexpected behavior that indicates path traversal is occurring. Due to the code filtering for `.html` files, directly reading `/etc/passwd` content might not be immediately visible in the response.
    5. **Examine Logs:** Check application logs for file access attempts or errors related to the traversed path.

This combined list presents the identified vulnerabilities with detailed descriptions, impacts, mitigations, source code analysis, and test cases.
