### Vulnerability List for django-unicorn Project

This document outlines identified security vulnerabilities within the django-unicorn project. Each vulnerability is detailed with its description, potential impact, risk ranking, current and missing mitigations, preconditions for exploitation, source code analysis, and a security test case to validate the vulnerability.

#### Vulnerability 1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsafe String Rendering

* Description:
    1. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a component's property.
    2. If the developer uses the `safe` meta option in the component or `safe` template filter in the template for this property, the injected JavaScript code will be rendered without proper escaping.
    3. When a user interacts with the component or the component is re-rendered, the malicious JavaScript code will be executed in the user's browser.

* Impact:
    - Account takeover: An attacker could steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to account compromise.
    - Data theft: Malicious scripts can be used to extract data from the page and send it to a remote server controlled by the attacker.
    - Defacement: The attacker can modify the content of the web page, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other unwanted actions.
    - Full control of the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable web application.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - By default, django-unicorn HTML-encodes updated field values to prevent XSS attacks. This is implemented in the `sanitize_html` function in `django_unicorn.utils.py` and used in `django_unicorn.components.unicorn_template_response.py` during template rendering.
    - Developers must explicitly use the `safe` meta option or the `safe` template filter to render unescaped content. This mechanism is intended as a mitigation, requiring explicit developer action to disable default escaping. The `safe` meta option is handled in `django_unicorn.views.__init__.py` in the `_process_component_request` function where safe attributes are marked using `mark_safe`.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Clear documentation and warnings about the risks of using `safe` and when it is appropriate. Currently, documentation exists in `docs\source\views.md` and `docs\source\templates.md`, but it may not be prominent enough.
    - Security focused code examples that emphasize secure practices. Examples should consistently demonstrate safe practices and highlight the risks of using `safe`.
    - Potential for static analysis tools or linters to detect usage of `safe` and flag potential risks. No such tools or linters are currently implemented.

* Preconditions:
    - A django-unicorn component has a property that renders user-controlled string data into the template.
    - The developer has used `Meta.safe` or the `safe` template filter for this property, intending to render HTML but inadvertently allowing JavaScript execution.
    - An attacker is able to control or influence the string data that is rendered by the component.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`django_unicorn\utils.py`**: The `sanitize_html` function uses `html.translate(_json_script_escapes)` to escape HTML special characters. This function is used by default to prevent XSS.
    2. **`django_unicorn\components\unicorn_template_response.py`**: The `UnicornTemplateResponse.render` method renders the component and uses `BeautifulSoup` to manipulate the DOM. The `_desoupify` method, which is called at the end of `render`, uses `formatter=UnsortedAttributes()` and `soup.encode()` which by default will HTML-encode special characters unless explicitly bypassed.
    3. **`django_unicorn\views\__init__.py`**: In `_process_component_request`, after component actions are processed and before rendering, the code checks for `Meta.safe` attributes. If a property is listed in `Meta.safe`, it is marked as safe using `mark_safe(value)`. This bypasses the default HTML escaping when the template is rendered.
    4. **`tests\views\test_process_component_request.py`**: `test_html_entities_encoded` confirms that by default, HTML entities are encoded. `test_safe_html_entities_not_encoded` confirms that when `Meta.safe` is used, HTML entities are not encoded, demonstrating the intended but potentially risky behavior.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a django-unicorn component named `XssTestComponent` in `example/unicorn/components/xss_test.py`:
    ```python
    from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

    class XssTestView(UnicornView):
        unsafe_string = ""

        class Meta:
            safe = ("unsafe_string",)
    ```
    2. Create a template for the component at `example/unicorn/templates/xss-test.html`:
    ```html
    <div>
        <input type="text" unicorn:model="unsafe_string">
        <div id="output" unicorn:id="xss-output">{{ unsafe_string }}</div>
    </div>
    ```
    3. Create a URL pattern in `example/project/urls.py` to render this component:
    ```python
    from django.urls import path
    from example.unicorn.components.xss_test import XssTestView
    from django_unicorn.views import render_component

    urlpatterns = [
        path('xss-test/', render_component, name='xss_test'),
    ]
    ```
    4. Access the component in a browser by navigating to `/xss-test/`.
    5. In the input field, enter the following malicious payload: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.
    6. Click outside the input field or trigger an update to the component (e.g., by adding a button that triggers an action).
    7. Observe that a JavaScript alert box appears with the message "XSS", demonstrating successful execution of injected JavaScript code.

#### Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsafe HTML Attributes

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious string containing Javascript code.
    2. The attacker injects this malicious string into a component property using mechanisms such as URL parameters or direct data manipulation if possible.
    3. The application uses `unicorn:attr`, `unicorn:dirty.attr`, or `unicorn:loading.attr` directives in the component's template to bind this attacker-controlled component property to an HTML attribute.
    4. When the component updates, the server-side `django-unicorn` library renders the HTML, including the attribute with the malicious string. The HTML encoding applied is not context-aware for HTML attributes.
    5. The browser receives the HTML containing the injected Javascript within the attribute.
    6. Depending on the attribute context (e.g., event handlers like `onmouseover`, `onclick`), the browser executes the injected Javascript code, leading to Cross-Site Scripting.

* Impact:
    - Critical
    - Successful XSS attack can allow the attacker to:
        - Steal user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
        - Redirect users to malicious websites.
        - Deface the website.
        - Inject malware.
        - Perform actions on behalf of the user.

* Vulnerability Rank: critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - HTML encoding of component responses: Django-unicorn performs HTML encoding during component rendering, as indicated in the changelog for version v0.36.0 to address CVE-2021-42053. This encoding is applied in the `_desoupify` method of `UnicornTemplateResponse` (`django_unicorn/components/unicorn_template_response.py`). However, this encoding is not context-aware; it encodes HTML content primarily for element bodies and does not provide specific, attribute-contextual escaping. Therefore, it's insufficient to prevent XSS in HTML attributes, especially when using dynamic attribute directives like `unicorn:attr`, `unicorn:dirty.attr`, and `unicorn:loading.attr`.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Context-aware output encoding for HTML attributes: Implement context-sensitive escaping tailored for HTML attributes. This involves using different encoding functions based on the attribute's type and context (e.g., Javascript escaping for event handler attributes like `on*`, URL encoding for `href`, and standard HTML encoding for data attributes).
    - Input validation and sanitization: Sanitize user inputs on the server-side, particularly for component properties that are dynamically bound to HTML attributes. Employ a library like DOMPurify or similar to strip out potentially malicious Javascript code from user-provided input before rendering it into HTML attributes.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Enforce a strict Content Security Policy to restrict the capabilities of injected scripts. CSP can significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks by limiting the actions malicious scripts can perform, even if injection occurs.

* Preconditions:
    - The Django application uses `django-unicorn` version prior to a fix for this vulnerability.
    - The application's templates utilize `unicorn:attr`, `unicorn:dirty.attr`, `unicorn:loading.attr`, or similar directives to dynamically set HTML attributes based on component properties.
    - An attacker can control or influence the value of a component property that is bound to an HTML attribute. This could be achieved through URL parameters, form inputs, or any other input vector that allows modification of component state.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`django_unicorn/components/unicorn_template_response.py`**: The `UnicornTemplateResponse` class is responsible for rendering the component's template. The `_desoupify(soup)` method within this class is used to serialize the BeautifulSoup object back into an HTML string.
    2. **`UnicornTemplateResponse._desoupify(soup)`**: This method utilizes `soup.encode(formatter=UnsortedAttributes()).decode("utf-8")`. The `UnsortedAttributes` formatter is used to prevent attribute reordering, but it does not inherently provide context-aware escaping for HTML attributes. The default encoder in BeautifulSoup (or as configured here) may perform HTML entity encoding, which is generally sufficient for HTML element content but not reliably for all attribute contexts, especially Javascript event handlers or attributes that can interpret Javascript.
    3. **`django_unicorn/views/__init__.py`**: The `_process_component_request` function orchestrates the component lifecycle, including rendering. It calls `component.render(request=request)` which eventually leads to the use of `UnicornTemplateResponse` to render the template and apply the HTML serialization. There is no explicit logic within these files to perform context-aware escaping of HTML attributes specifically.
    4. **`django_unicorn/templatetags/unicorn.py`**: The `unicorn` template tag handles component rendering within Django templates. It does not include any attribute-specific encoding logic; it primarily focuses on instantiating and rendering the component.
    5. **`tests/views/test_process_component_request.py`**: This test file includes tests `test_html_entities_encoded` and `test_safe_html_entities_not_encoded`. These tests demonstrate that while HTML content within tags is encoded by default, this encoding is bypassed when using the `safe` attribute in the component's Meta class. This highlights a potential misuse scenario where developers might inadvertently disable encoding for attributes by including attribute names in the `safe` tuple, if such functionality was extended to attributes. However, as of current analysis, the `safe` attribute only affects the encoding of the component's main HTML content, not attributes.
    6. **Lack of Attribute Encoding**:  Analyzing the code, specifically `_desoupify` in `django_unicorn/components/unicorn_template_response.py`, reveals that while HTML encoding is applied, it appears to be a general HTML entity encoding. There is no evidence of context-aware encoding that would differentiate between HTML element content and HTML attributes, nor different attribute types (like event handlers, URLs, or data attributes). This absence of context-aware attribute encoding confirms the vulnerability.

    **Code Snippet from `django_unicorn/components/unicorn_template_response.py` (relevant part):**
    ```python
    class UnsortedAttributes(HTMLFormatter):
        """
        Prevent beautifulsoup from re-ordering attributes.
        """
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__(entity_substitution=EntitySubstitution.substitute_html)

        def attributes(self, tag: Tag):
            yield from tag.attrs.items()

    class UnicornTemplateResponse(TemplateResponse):
        # ...
        @staticmethod
        def _desoupify(soup):
            soup.smooth()
            return soup.encode(formatter=UnsortedAttributes()).decode("utf-8")
    ```
    The `entity_substitution=EntitySubstitution.substitute_html` in `UnsortedAttributes` suggests basic HTML entity encoding, which is not sufficient for preventing XSS in HTML attributes, especially event handlers.

* Security test case:
    1. **Setup**: Ensure you have a Django project with `django-unicorn` installed.
    2. **Create Component (`components/xss_attr_component.py`):**
        ```python
        from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

        class XssAttrComponentView(UnicornView):
            attribute_value = ""
            event_handler_value = ""

            def mount(self):
                self.attribute_value = self.request.GET.get("attr_val", "")
                self.event_handler_value = self.request.GET.get("event_val", "")
        ```
    3. **Create Template (`templates/unicorn/xss-attr-component.html`):**
        ```html
        <div>
            <div unicorn:attr.data-xss="{{ attribute_value }}">Test Data Attribute XSS</div>
            <button unicorn:click="do_nothing" unicorn:attr.onmouseover="{{ event_handler_value }}">Hover for Event Handler XSS</button>
        </div>
        ```
    4. **Create View (`views.py`):**
        ```python
        from django.shortcuts import render

        def xss_attr_test_view(request):
            return render(request, 'xss_attr_test.html')
        ```
    5. **Configure URL (`urls.py`):**
        ```python
        from django.urls import path, include
        from .views import xss_attr_test_view

        urlpatterns = [
            path('xss_attr_test/', xss_attr_test_view, name='xss_attr_test'),
            path("unicorn/", include("django_unicorn.urls")),
        ]
        ```
    6. **Test Case 1: Data Attribute XSS**:
        - Access the URL with a Javascript injection in the `attr_val` parameter: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/xss_attr_test/?attr_val=" onclick=alert('Data_Attribute_XSS')"`
        - Inspect the HTML source of the rendered page. Verify that the `data-xss` attribute of the first `div` contains the injected Javascript: `<div unicorn:attr.data-xss=" onclick=alert('Data_Attribute_XSS')">Test Data Attribute XSS</div>`
        - While `data-xss` itself won't directly execute Javascript, this confirms that unsanitized input can be placed into attributes using `unicorn:attr`.

    7. **Test Case 2: Event Handler Attribute XSS (Critical)**:
        - Access the URL with a Javascript injection in the `event_val` parameter targeting `onmouseover`: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/xss_attr_test/?event_val="alert('EventHandler_XSS')"`
        - Load the page in a browser.
        - Hover the "Hover for Event Handler XSS" button.
        - If a Javascript alert box with the message "EventHandler_XSS" appears, the XSS vulnerability is confirmed.
        - Inspect the HTML source to confirm the `onmouseover` attribute of the button contains the injected Javascript: `<button unicorn:click="do_nothing" unicorn:attr.onmouseover="alert('EventHandler_XSS')">Hover for Event Handler XSS</button>`

This combined list details two distinct Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities present in the django-unicorn project. Both vulnerabilities highlight different scenarios where improper handling of user-controlled data can lead to the execution of malicious JavaScript code within a user's browser.
