### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Deno Executable Path Vulnerability
- Description:
    - An attacker can trick a user into configuring the `deno.path` setting in VS Code to point to a malicious executable.
    - The VS Code Deno extension, upon activation or restart of the language server, retrieves the path specified in `deno.path` setting.
    - It then uses this path to execute the Deno CLI as a language server.
    - If the `deno.path` is maliciously altered to point to an attacker-controlled executable, the extension will inadvertently execute this malicious program instead of the legitimate Deno CLI.
    - This can be achieved through social engineering, where an attacker convinces a user to manually change the `deno.path` setting, or potentially through workspace configuration manipulation in a compromised project.
- Impact:
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the user's system with the privileges of the VS Code process.
    - This could lead to a range of malicious activities, including:
        - Data exfiltration: Sensitive information from the user's workspace or system could be stolen.
        - Malware installation: The attacker could install persistent malware on the user's machine.
        - System compromise: Full control over the user's system could be achieved, allowing for further malicious actions.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The current implementation directly uses the user-provided path from the `deno.path` setting without any validation or sanitization.
    - The documentation in `README.md` and `docs/Configuration.md` (not provided, but assumed based on description) only describes how to set the `deno.path` setting, without any security warnings regarding the risks of using untrusted executables.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: The extension should validate the `deno.path` setting to ensure it points to a legitimate Deno executable. This could involve:
        - Path traversal checks: Prevent paths that go outside of expected directories.
        - Executable verification: Check if the executable at the specified path is indeed a Deno CLI executable (e.g., by checking its signature or version information).
        - Whitelisting: Consider allowing `deno.path` to be set only to paths within a controlled or expected directory.
    - User warnings: Display a clear warning message to the user when they are about to change the `deno.path` setting, especially if it's being set outside of standard installation paths. Emphasize the security risks associated with using untrusted executables.
    - Secure defaults:  The default behavior should be to rely on the Deno executable found in the system's PATH environment variable, as this is generally managed by the user or system administrator. Avoid prompting users to change `deno.path` unless absolutely necessary and with clear security guidance.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the VS Code Deno extension installed and enabled.
    - An attacker must successfully trick the user into modifying the `deno.path` setting in VS Code to point to a malicious executable. This could be through:
        - Social engineering: Deceiving the user through phishing or other manipulative techniques.
        - Workspace compromise: If a user opens a compromised workspace, the attacker might have pre-configured workspace settings that include a malicious `deno.path`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `client\src\util.ts`:
        - `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` function reads the `deno.path` configuration from VS Code settings using `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string>("path")`.
        - No validation or sanitization is performed on the retrieved path.
        - `getDenoCommandPath()` function calls `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` to get the configured path. If the path is relative, it attempts to resolve it within workspace folders, but still without validation for malicious executables. If no configured path is found, it defaults to searching for "deno" in the system's PATH.
    - `client\src\commands.ts`:
        - `startLanguageServer()` function calls `getDenoCommandPath()` to obtain the path to the Deno executable.
        - The returned path is directly used within the `ServerOptions` in the `command` property for both `run` and `debug` configurations of the LanguageClient:
        ```typescript
        const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
          run: {
            command, // Path from getDenoCommandPath()
            args: ["lsp"],
            options: { env },
          },
          debug: {
            command, // Path from getDenoCommandPath()
            args: ["lsp"],
            options: { env },
          },
        };
        const client = new LanguageClient( ... , serverOptions, ... );
        ```
        - The `LanguageClient` then uses this `command` to spawn the Deno language server process using `child_process.spawn`.
        - There is no security check or validation of the executable path before it is used to spawn the process.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Preparation:**
        - Create a simple malicious executable file. For example:
            - On Linux/macOS, create a file named `malicious_deno` with the following content and make it executable (`chmod +x malicious_deno`):
            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "Malicious Deno Executable executed!" > /tmp/malicious_deno_execution.log
            sleep 5 # Simulate some work to keep VS Code running
            ```
            - On Windows, create a file named `malicious_deno.bat` with the following content:
            ```batch
            @echo off
            echo Malicious Deno Executable executed! > %TEMP%\malicious_deno_execution.log
            timeout /t 5 /nobreak > NUL # Simulate some work
            ```
        - Place this malicious executable in a known location on your system, for example, `/tmp/` on Linux/macOS or `C:\TEMP\` on Windows.
    2. **VS Code Configuration:**
        - Open VS Code and go to Settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings).
        - Search for "deno.path".
        - Edit the `Deno â€º Path` setting and set it to the path of the malicious executable you created in step 1 (e.g., `/tmp/malicious_deno` or `C:\TEMP\malicious_deno.bat`).
    3. **Trigger Extension Activation:**
        - Restart VS Code or reload the VS Code window (Developer: Reload Window). This will trigger the Deno extension to activate and start the language server.
    4. **Observe Malicious Execution:**
        - Check for the log file created by the malicious executable.
            - On Linux/macOS, check for `/tmp/malicious_deno_execution.log`.
            - On Windows, check for `%TEMP%\malicious_deno_execution.log` (you can usually access the temp directory by typing `%TEMP%` in the File Explorer address bar).
        - If the log file exists and contains the message "Malicious Deno Executable executed!", it confirms that the malicious executable was successfully executed by the VS Code Deno extension due to the manipulated `deno.path` setting.

This test case demonstrates that by altering the `deno.path` setting, an attacker can indeed achieve arbitrary code execution through the VS Code Deno extension.
