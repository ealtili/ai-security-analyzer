### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Unvalidated Deno Executable Path Configuration
- Description:
    1. An attacker social engineers a victim into installing the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension.
    2. The attacker convinces the victim to configure the `deno.path` setting in VS Code.
    3. The victim is tricked into setting `deno.path` to point to a malicious executable instead of the legitimate Deno CLI. This could be achieved by various social engineering techniques, such as suggesting a specific configuration as part of a tutorial, or in a compromised project's documentation.
    4. When the extension is activated in a workspace (either automatically or by user action like enabling Deno for the workspace), it uses the configured `deno.path` to execute what it believes to be the Deno CLI.
    5. Instead of the real Deno CLI, the malicious executable provided by the attacker is executed.
    6. The malicious executable runs with the privileges of the VS Code user, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VS Code user.
    - Potential for data theft, malware installation, or system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the code itself. The `README.md` contains a "Important" section that warns users about setting `deno.path`: `> ⚠️ **Important:** You need to have a version of Deno CLI installed (v1.13.0 or > later). The extension requires the executable and by default will use the > environment path. You can explicitly set the path to the executable in Visual > Studio Code Settings for deno.path.` However, this is only documentation and does not prevent the vulnerability.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Path validation: The extension should validate the `deno.path` setting to ensure it points to a legitimate Deno CLI executable. This could include:
        - Checking if the executable exists.
        - Verifying the executable is indeed a Deno CLI by checking its version or signature.
        - Displaying a warning message if the path is unusual or potentially malicious.
    - User awareness improvement: Enhance the warning in the settings UI and potentially display a confirmation dialog when a user sets a custom `deno.path`, especially if it's outside of standard Deno installation locations.
- Preconditions:
    - The victim has installed the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension.
    - The victim is socially engineered into setting the `deno.path` setting in VS Code to a malicious executable.
    - The extension is activated in a workspace.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `client/src/util.ts`**
        - Function `getDenoCommandPath()` is responsible for determining the path to the Deno executable.
        - It first calls `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` to retrieve the path from the `deno.path` setting in VS Code configuration:
          ```typescript
          function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
            const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)
              .get<string>("path");
            // it is possible for the path to be blank. In that case, return undefined
            if (typeof exePath === "string" && exePath.trim().length === 0) {
              return undefined;
            } else {
              return exePath;
            }
          }
          ```
        - If `deno.path` is set, this function directly returns the user-provided path without any validation.
        - `getDenoCommandPath()` then uses this path, or if it's not set or is relative, attempts to resolve it from environment paths and default installation locations, but the user-provided path takes precedence.
    2. **File: `client/src/extension.ts`**
        - In the `startLanguageServer` command handler, `getDenoCommandPath()` is called to get the Deno executable path:
          ```typescript
          const command = await getDenoCommandPath();
          if (command == null) {
             // ... error handling ...
             return;
          }
          ```
        - The `command` variable, which can be a user-controlled path, is then used to spawn the Deno Language Server:
          ```typescript
          const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
            run: {
              command, // User-controlled path used here
              args: ["lsp"],
              options: { env },
            },
            debug: {
              command, // User-controlled path used here
              // ...
              args: ["lsp"],
              options: { env },
            },
          };
          const client = new LanguageClient( ... serverOptions, ... );
          await client.start();
          ```
        - This clearly demonstrates that the extension directly executes the path specified in `deno.path` without any validation.

        graph LR
            A[VS Code Configuration (deno.path)] --> B(getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath);
            B --> C{Is deno.path set?};
            C -- Yes --> D[Return user-provided path];
            C -- No --> E[getDefaultDenoCommand];
            E --> F[Resolve from PATH and default locations];
            D --> G(getDenoCommandPath);
            F --> G;
            G --> H[startLanguageServer (extension.ts)];
            H --> I[LanguageClient (execute command)];
            I --> J[Malicious Executable (if user-provided path is malicious)];
        ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Install the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension in VS Code.
        - Create a malicious executable file (e.g., `malicious_deno.bat` on Windows or `malicious_deno.sh` on Linux/macOS). This script should simply echo a message and can simulate malicious actions. For example, on Linux/macOS:
          ```bash
          #!/bin/bash
          echo "Malicious Deno Executable is running!"
          touch /tmp/pwned.txt # Simulate malicious action - create a file
          exit 1 # Exit with an error to simulate a broken Deno CLI
          ```
          Make this script executable (`chmod +x malicious_deno.sh`). On Windows:
          ```bat
          @echo off
          echo Malicious Deno Executable is running!
          type nul > C:\pwned.txt  # Simulate malicious action - create a file
          exit 1 # Exit with an error to simulate a broken Deno CLI
          ```
        - Place this malicious script in a known location on your system (e.g., `/tmp/malicious_deno.sh` or `C:\malicious_deno.bat`).
    2. **VS Code Configuration:**
        - Open VS Code settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings).
        - Search for "deno.path".
        - In the "Deno: Path" setting, enter the path to your malicious executable (e.g., `/tmp/malicious_deno.sh` or `C:\malicious_deno.bat`).
    3. **Activate the Extension:**
        - Open any JavaScript or TypeScript file in VS Code to activate the Deno extension. You might need to open a workspace folder to ensure the extension fully activates.
    4. **Observe the Execution:**
        - Check the VS Code Output panel (View -> Output) and select "Deno Language Server" in the dropdown.
        - You should see the output "Malicious Deno Executable is running!" in the output panel, indicating that your malicious script was executed instead of the real Deno CLI.
        - Verify that the simulated malicious action was performed (e.g., the `/tmp/pwned.txt` or `C:\pwned.txt` file was created).
    5. **Expected Result:** The malicious executable is successfully executed by the extension when it attempts to start the Deno Language Server, proving the vulnerability. The output panel should show the echo from the malicious script, and the simulated malicious action should be observed. The extension will likely fail to function correctly as the malicious script is not a valid Deno CLI.
