* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code
* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a screenshot that includes text resembling UI elements but containing an XSS payload, for example, `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`.
    2. The attacker uploads this screenshot to the application, either directly or indirectly by providing a URL for the application to take a screenshot of.
    3. The backend uses an AI model to analyze the screenshot and generate frontend code (e.g., React, HTML).
    4. The system prompts, as seen in `backend\prompts\test_prompts.py`, explicitly instruct the AI to "Use the exact text from the screenshot". This instruction leads the AI model to misinterpret the XSS payload in the screenshot as a legitimate UI element and generate code that includes the payload verbatim, without proper sanitization or encoding.
    5. When a user integrates this AI-generated code into their application and if the generated code is executed in a web browser, the XSS payload will be executed, potentially allowing the attacker to perform malicious actions on behalf of the user.
* Impact:
    Successful XSS exploitation can lead to:
    - Account hijacking: Attackers can steal session cookies or credentials.
    - Defacement: Attackers can modify the content of the web page.
    - Redirection: Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Information theft: Attackers can steal sensitive user data.
    - Execution of arbitrary JavaScript: Attackers can perform any action that the user can perform.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None are apparent in the provided code. The system prompts in `backend\prompts\test_prompts.py` instruct the AI to use the exact text from the screenshot, indicating a lack of sanitization at the code generation stage. The code extraction logic in `backend\codegen\utils.py` and `backend\video\utils.py` focuses on extracting content without any sanitization or encoding mechanisms.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Output encoding: Encode the AI-generated code, especially text content, before presenting it to the user. For example, if HTML is generated, ensure that any user-provided text is HTML-encoded to prevent interpretation as HTML tags.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP headers to limit the capabilities of the browser when executing the generated code, reducing the impact of XSS. This is a general mitigation and not specific to code generation, but a good practice to limit the damage if XSS occurs.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to upload a screenshot or provide a URL to be screenshotted by the application.
    - The AI model must generate code that includes the XSS payload from the screenshot. The system prompts in `backend\prompts\test_prompts.py` increase the likelihood of this precondition being met due to the instruction "Use the exact text from the screenshot."
    - The user must integrate the AI-generated code into a web application and deploy it without reviewing and sanitizing the code.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. `backend\routes\generate_code.py`: Receives the screenshot and calls `create_prompt`.
    2. `backend\prompts\__init__.py`: `assemble_prompt` function takes the image data URL and system prompt. System prompts in `backend\prompts\test_prompts.py` (and `backend\prompts\screenshot_system_prompts.py` - from previous analysis) instruct the AI to "Use the exact text from the screenshot". This instruction ensures that any text, including XSS payloads, from the screenshot will be considered by the AI for code generation.
    3. `backend\llm.py`: Calls the LLM API and streams the response back. The AI model, based on the prompts, is likely to include the XSS payload in its response if it interprets it as part of the UI text.
    4. `backend\codegen\utils.py`: `extract_html_content` extracts HTML content using regex. This function, as well as `extract_tag_content` in `backend\video\utils.py`, is purely for extraction and does not perform any sanitization. Malicious code embedded in the extracted content will be preserved.
    5. The generated code is sent to the frontend and presented to the user. If the generated code contains an XSS payload and the user uses this code, the vulnerability can be triggered when a user's browser renders the unsanitized AI-generated code.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a screenshot image. Use an image editor or a simple HTML page screenshot tool to create an image that visually contains the following text:
       ```html
       <h1>Hello World</h1>
       <img src=x onerror=alert("XSS Vulnerability")>
       ```
       The goal is to make the text `<img src=x onerror=alert("XSS Vulnerability")>` appear as part of the UI in the screenshot.
    2. Access the hosted version of the application (or a locally running instance).
    3. Upload the crafted screenshot image to the application. Alternatively, use the screenshot URL feature (if available in the frontend) and point it to a webpage displaying the above HTML.
    4. Select any stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind).
    5. Initiate code generation.
    6. Once the code is generated, examine the generated code output. Look for the presence of the `<img src=x onerror=alert("XSS Vulnerability")>` tag or any similar JavaScript code that could have been generated from the screenshot text.
    7. Copy the generated HTML code.
    8. Create a new HTML file (e.g., `test.html`) and paste the generated code into it.
    9. Open `test.html` in a web browser.
    10. Observe if an alert box with "XSS Vulnerability" appears. If it does, the XSS vulnerability is confirmed, meaning the AI model has generated code including the malicious payload from the screenshot, and the application has not sanitized the output.
