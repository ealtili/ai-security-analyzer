### Vulnerability List for screenshot-to-code Project

- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code
- Description:
    1. A user uploads a screenshot or design mockup to the `screenshot-to-code` application.
    2. The application's backend uses an AI model (like Claude or GPT) to generate code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) based on the input.
    3. Due to the nature of AI-generated content and potential prompt injection or misinterpretation of the input, the generated code might inadvertently or intentionally include malicious JavaScript code. For example, the AI might generate HTML with inline `<script>` tags or event handlers containing JavaScript from the input image's text content if it is not properly sanitized.
    4. The `screenshot-to-code` application directly returns this generated code to the user through the frontend without any security sanitization or content inspection.
    5. A user, without performing a security review of the generated code, deploys it to a web server.
    6. When other users access the deployed web application, the malicious JavaScript code embedded within the AI-generated code executes in their browsers, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Impact:
    - Account Takeover: Attackers can steal session cookies or other authentication tokens, leading to account hijacking.
    - Website Defacement: Attackers can modify the content of the web page seen by users.
    - Redirection to Malicious Sites: Users can be redirected to attacker-controlled websites, potentially for phishing or malware distribution.
    - Data Theft: Attackers can steal sensitive information displayed on the page or accessible through the user's session, including personal data or API keys stored in local storage.
    - Malware Distribution: Attackers could use the XSS vulnerability to distribute malware to users visiting the compromised website.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project focuses on functionality and code generation accuracy, not on security of the generated code. The documentation implicitly suggests user review of the generated code before deployment, but no automated mitigations are in place within the application itself.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Output Sanitization: Implement server-side or client-side sanitization of the AI-generated code before presenting it to the user or allowing deployment. This would involve parsing the generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and removing or escaping potentially dangerous elements and attributes. However, this is complex as overly aggressive sanitization might break the intended functionality of the generated code.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP) Recommendation:  The application could be enhanced to recommend or automatically include a Content Security Policy (CSP) in the header of the generated HTML. CSP is a browser security mechanism that can help mitigate XSS attacks by controlling the resources the browser is allowed to load. Instructions on how to configure CSP for deployed applications could be added to the documentation.
    - Security Warning:  Implement a clear and prominent warning within the application's frontend, displayed to the user whenever code is generated. This warning should explicitly state the potential security risks of deploying AI-generated code without a thorough security review and recommend manual inspection and security testing of the code before deployment.
- Preconditions:
    1. The user must utilize the `screenshot-to-code` application to generate web application code.
    2. The AI model must generate code that contains malicious JavaScript. This could be due to prompt injection, misinterpretation of input, or inherent limitations of the AI model in generating secure code.
    3. The user must deploy the AI-generated code to a publicly accessible web server without conducting a security review.
    4. End-users must access the deployed web application through their browsers.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `backend/routes/generate_code.py`: This file contains the core logic for generating code using AI models. It receives user input (screenshot, parameters), constructs prompts, and sends them to the LLM APIs (`backend/llm.py`). The AI-generated code is received back and passed directly to the frontend via WebSocket. There are no code sanitization or security checks performed on the AI's output within this route or in the `llm.py` module.
    - `backend/codegen/utils.py`: The `extract_html_content` function is used to parse and extract HTML from the AI's response. This function focuses on content extraction, not security sanitization. It does not remove or escape potentially malicious JavaScript or HTML attributes.
    - `frontend`: The frontend receives the AI-generated code via WebSocket and displays it to the user, typically allowing the user to copy or download the code. There is no client-side sanitization performed in the frontend either.
    - `backend/mock_llm.py`: This file provides mock responses for LLM calls, used in development and testing. These mock responses include examples of generated HTML code, for example `APPLE_MOCK_CODE`, `NYTIMES_MOCK_CODE`, `NO_IMAGES_NYTIMES_MOCK_CODE`, `MORTGAGE_CALCULATOR_VIDEO_PROMPT_MOCK`, `GOOGLE_FORM_VIDEO_PROMPT_MOCK`, `TALLY_FORM_VIDEO_PROMPT_MOCK`. While these mock responses themselves are not directly a vulnerability, they represent the type of HTML code that the AI can generate and that the application handles without sanitization, further illustrating the potential for XSS if malicious JavaScript is present in the AI-generated output.
    - `backend/image_generation/core.py`: This file handles image generation. It processes alt texts from the generated HTML and uses them as prompts to generate images, which are then used to replace placeholder images in the HTML. While image generation itself does not introduce direct XSS, the process highlights that the backend is manipulating and processing the AI-generated HTML code, and any vulnerability in the initial code generation step (like XSS) will be propagated through this process.
    - **Visualization:** The data flow is as follows: User Input (Screenshot) -> Backend (`generate_code.py`, `llm.py`, `prompts/`) -> AI Model (Claude/GPT) -> Generated Code (potentially with XSS) -> Backend (`generate_code.py`) -> Frontend -> User (for deployment).  No sanitization occurs at any stage in this flow.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Environment Setup:** Deploy a local instance of the `screenshot-to-code` project according to the instructions in the `README.md`.
    2. **Malicious Input Preparation:** Create a simple image (e.g., using an image editor or even a text-to-image AI) that contains text that could be interpreted as JavaScript code, such as: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` or `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. Alternatively, find an online image or create a design mockup that incorporates such text.
    3. **Code Generation:** In the `screenshot-to-code` frontend, upload the prepared malicious image. Select any supported stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind). Initiate the code generation process.
    4. **Generated Code Inspection:** After the code generation is complete, carefully examine the generated HTML code in the frontend's output area. Look for the injected malicious JavaScript code, especially within `<script>` tags, event handler attributes (like `onload`, `onerror`, `onclick`), or as inline JavaScript within HTML attributes (e.g., `href="javascript:..."`). For example, you might find the exact malicious payload from your image input or a slightly modified but still executable JavaScript snippet.
    5. **Deployment of Vulnerable Code:** Copy the generated HTML code. Create a new HTML file (e.g., `xss_test.html`) and paste the generated code into it. Place this file on a simple HTTP server (you can use Python's `http.server` for local testing or any web server).
    6. **XSS Trigger and Verification:** Open `xss_test.html` in a web browser. If the generated code is vulnerable to XSS, you should observe the execution of the injected JavaScript code. In the case of `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`, an alert box with 'XSS' should pop up. If you used `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, the alert should also appear.
    7. **Exploit Confirmation:** Successful execution of the JavaScript code confirms the XSS vulnerability. You can then attempt more sophisticated XSS payloads to further assess the vulnerability, such as code to steal cookies or redirect to another site.
