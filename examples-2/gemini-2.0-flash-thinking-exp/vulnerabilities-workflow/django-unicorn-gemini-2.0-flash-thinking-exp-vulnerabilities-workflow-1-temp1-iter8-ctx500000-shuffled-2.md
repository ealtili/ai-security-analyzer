- Vulnerability name: Default Django Model Serialization Exposes All Fields
- Description: By default, when a Django Model is used as a field in a Unicorn component and bound using `unicorn:model`, the entire model instance, including all its fields, is serialized and exposed in the HTML source code as part of the component's data. This default behavior can lead to unintentional exposure of sensitive or internal data that developers might not intend to be publicly accessible. An attacker viewing the page source can easily access this serialized data.
- Impact: High - Information Disclosure. An attacker can potentially access sensitive data, such as private user details, internal system information, or other confidential model attributes, by simply inspecting the HTML source of the webpage. This can lead to further attacks or privacy breaches.
- Vulnerability rank: high
- Currently implemented mitigations: The documentation (`django-models.md`) explicitly warns about this behavior and suggests mitigation strategies:
    - Customizing model serialization to expose only necessary fields.
    - Using `Meta.exclude` or `Meta.javascript_exclude` in the Unicorn component to prevent specific fields from being serialized.
    However, these mitigations require manual implementation by the developer and are not enforced by default.
- Missing mitigations:
    - The project lacks a default mechanism to prevent full model serialization. It could benefit from a configuration setting to control the default serialization behavior, perhaps serializing only a predefined set of fields (like public fields) or requiring explicit opt-in for full model serialization.
    - More prominent warnings or best practices in the main documentation to highlight the security implications of default model serialization.
- Preconditions:
    - A Django Unicorn component uses a Django Model as a class variable.
    - This model field is bound in the template using `unicorn:model` or accessed within the template.
    - The developer does not implement any of the documented mitigations to restrict field serialization.
- Source code analysis:
    - `django-unicorn\docs\source\django-models.md`: This documentation file clearly explains the default serialization behavior and the warning: "Using this functionality will serialize your entire model by default and expose all of the values in the HTML source code. Do not use this particular functionality if there are properties that need to be kept private." It also describes mitigation options using `Meta.exclude` and `Meta.javascript_exclude`.
    - `django-unicorn\docs\source\views.md`: Mentions `javascript_exclude` as a way to prevent data from being exposed to javascript, reinforcing the idea that data *is* exposed by default.
- Security test case:
    - Step 1: Create a Django application with django-unicorn installed.
    - Step 2: Define a Django Model (e.g., `UserProfile`) with some fields, including a field considered sensitive (e.g., `ssn`).
    - Step 3: Create a Unicorn component (e.g., `ProfileComponent`) that includes an instance of `UserProfile` as a public class variable.
    - Step 4: In the component's template, bind a field of the `UserProfile` to an input using `unicorn:model` (e.g., `<input type="text" unicorn:model="user_profile.name">`). Or just render `{{ user_profile }}` or `{{ user_profile.ssn }}` in the template.
    - Step 5: Create a Django view and template to render the `ProfileComponent`.
    - Step 6: As an external attacker, access the rendered page in a browser.
    - Step 7: Inspect the HTML source code of the page.
    - Step 8: Verify that the entire serialized `UserProfile` object is present in the HTML, including the sensitive field (e.g., `ssn`), within the JSON data embedded for the Unicorn component.
