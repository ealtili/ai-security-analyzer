Okay, I understand the instructions. Please provide the list of vulnerabilities. I will process it according to your guidelines, filtering and formatting the output in markdown as you requested. I will carefully consider each vulnerability against the exclusion and inclusion criteria you've provided and ensure that the output list only contains valid, high-ranked (or critical), and unmitigated vulnerabilities that are not caused by the excluded conditions.

Looking forward to receiving the vulnerability list!
