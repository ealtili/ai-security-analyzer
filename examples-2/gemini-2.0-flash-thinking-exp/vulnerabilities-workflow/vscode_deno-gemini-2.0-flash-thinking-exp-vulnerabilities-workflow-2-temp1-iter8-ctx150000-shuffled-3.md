### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary command execution via tasks in `deno.json`
- Description:
    1. A threat actor crafts a malicious Deno project.
    2. This project includes a `deno.json` file that defines a task with a malicious command. For example, a task could be designed to execute a shell command that downloads and runs an arbitrary script.
    3. A developer opens this malicious project in VS Code with the Deno extension enabled.
    4. The Deno extension parses the `deno.json` file and detects the defined tasks.
    5. The developer interacts with the task sidebar (either intentionally or accidentally, e.g., by clicking on a task in the sidebar).
    6. The extension executes the command defined in the malicious task definition using `vscode.tasks.executeTask`.
    7. This results in arbitrary command execution on the developer's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.
- Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the developer's machine. This can lead to full system compromise, including data exfiltration, malware installation, and further attacks on the developer's environment and potentially their organization.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None apparent from the provided code. The extension seems to directly execute commands defined in `deno.json` tasks without any sanitization or sandboxing. The `client/src/tasks.ts` and `client/src/tasks_sidebar.ts` files handle task definition and execution, and they do not implement any security checks on the task commands or arguments.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Command sanitization: The extension should sanitize or validate the commands and arguments defined in `deno.json` tasks to prevent the execution of malicious commands.
    - Sandboxing: Task execution should be sandboxed to limit the potential damage from malicious tasks. Ideally, tasks should be executed in a restricted environment with minimal privileges.
    - User confirmation: Before executing any task defined in `deno.json`, especially those from external or untrusted projects, the extension should prompt the user for confirmation, clearly indicating the command to be executed and warning about potential security risks.
- Preconditions:
    1. The developer must have the Deno extension for VS Code installed and enabled.
    2. The developer must open a malicious Deno project in VS Code that contains a crafted `deno.json` file with a malicious task definition.
    3. The developer must interact with the task sidebar and trigger the execution of the malicious task. This could be unintentional if tasks are automatically run or easily triggered.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. `client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`: This file is responsible for displaying tasks in the VS Code sidebar and handling task execution.
    2. `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider.prototype.#runTask` function: This function is called when a task is executed from the sidebar. It directly calls `tasks.executeTask(task.task);` where `task.task` is a `vscode.Task` object created from the task definition in `deno.json`.
    3. `client\src\tasks.ts`: This file contains functions for building `vscode.Task` objects from task definitions.
    4. `buildDenoConfigTask` function: This function constructs a `vscode.Task` using `vscode.ProcessExecution`. The `ProcessExecution` directly executes the command and arguments provided in the task definition. There is no sanitization or validation of these command or arguments within this function or in the task execution flow.
    5. `readTaskDefinitions` function in `client\src\util.ts`: This function parses `deno.json` to extract task definitions. It uses `jsoncParser.parseTree` but performs no validation or sanitization of the command or arguments within task definitions.
    6. Visualization:
       ```
       deno.json (malicious task definition) --> readTaskDefinitions (client/src/util.ts) --> DenoTaskProvider (client/src/tasks_sidebar.ts) --> buildDenoConfigTask (client/src/tasks.ts) --> vscode.tasks.executeTask (VS Code API) --> Command Execution
       ```
       The flow shows that the command from `deno.json` is directly passed to VS Code task execution API without any security checks.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new directory named `malicious-deno-project`.
    2. Inside `malicious-deno-project`, create a file named `deno.json` with the following content:
       ```json
       {
         "tasks": {
           "maliciousTask": "echo Vulnerability triggered && calc.exe"
         }
       }
       ```
       *Note: `calc.exe` is used as a harmless example. A real attacker would use a more malicious command.*
    3. Open VS Code and open the `malicious-deno-project` folder.
    4. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace.
    5. Open the "Deno Tasks" sidebar (if not already visible, open command palette and search for "Deno Tasks: Focus on Tasks View").
    6. In the "Deno Tasks" sidebar, you should see "maliciousTask" listed under the `deno.json` file.
    7. Right-click on "maliciousTask" and select "Run Task" (or double-click the task).
    8. Observe that the command `echo Vulnerability triggered && calc.exe` is executed. You should see "Vulnerability triggered" in the terminal output, and `calc.exe` (Calculator application on Windows) should launch, demonstrating arbitrary command execution.
    9. For other operating systems, replace `calc.exe` with a command appropriate for that OS, like `open -a Calculator` on macOS, or `gnome-calculator` or `xcalc` on Linux. For a more impactful test, replace `calc.exe` with a command that creates a file or exfiltrates data.

This test case demonstrates that a malicious `deno.json` can be crafted to execute arbitrary commands when a task is triggered in the VS Code Deno extension, confirming the vulnerability.
