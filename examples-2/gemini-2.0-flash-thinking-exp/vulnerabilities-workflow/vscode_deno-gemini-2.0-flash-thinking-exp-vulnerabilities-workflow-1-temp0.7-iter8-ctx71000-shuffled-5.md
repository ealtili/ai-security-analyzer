### Vulnerability List:

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in Test Code Lens and Tasks via `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args`

    *   **Description:**
        1.  The VSCode Deno extension allows users to configure arguments passed to the Deno CLI when running tests via Code Lenses or VSCode Tasks through the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args` settings.
        2.  These settings are directly incorporated into the command line executed by the extension without sufficient sanitization.
        3.  A threat actor can craft a malicious workspace with a `settings.json` file that modifies `deno.codeLens.testArgs` or `deno.testing.args` to inject arbitrary commands.
        4.  When a victim opens this workspace and attempts to run a test using Code Lens or a Deno task, the injected commands will be executed by the system.

    *   **Impact:**
        Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to complete compromise of the victim's system, including data theft, malware installation, and further propagation of attacks.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** critical

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        No input sanitization or validation is performed on the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args` settings before incorporating them into the command line.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Input sanitization: Sanitize the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args` settings to remove or escape shell-sensitive characters before using them in command execution.
        *   Input validation: Validate the structure and content of `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args` to ensure they only contain expected arguments and values. Consider using an allowlist of safe arguments.
        *   Principle of least privilege: While not a direct mitigation for command injection, ensure the extension runs with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful attack.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        1.  Victim opens a malicious workspace in VSCode that contains a `.vscode/settings.json` file.
        2.  The malicious `settings.json` file configures `deno.codeLens.testArgs` or `deno.testing.args` with malicious commands.
        3.  Victim has the VSCode Deno extension installed and enabled for the workspace.
        4.  Victim attempts to run a Deno test using Code Lens or executes a Deno task.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        1.  **File:** `client/src/commands.ts`
        2.  **Function:** `test`
        3.  **Line:** Approximately 449-452 (in the provided file content)
        ```typescript
        const testArgs: string[] = [
            ...(config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs") ?? []),
        ];
        ```
        4.  **Line:** Approximately 178-181 (in the provided file content) within `startLanguageServer` function where `initializationOptions` are set for client. This part reads configuration values which might be relevant to understand how settings are initially loaded.
        ```typescript
        initializationOptions: () => {
            const denoConfiguration = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get(
                EXTENSION_NS,
            ) as Record<string, unknown>;
            commands.transformDenoConfiguration(extensionContext, denoConfiguration);
            return {
                ...denoConfiguration,
                javascript: vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get("javascript"),
                typescript: vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get("typescript"),
                enableBuiltinCommands: true,
            } as object;
        },
        ```
        5.  The `config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs")` retrieves the array of arguments from the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting.
        6.  This array is directly spread into the `testArgs` array without any sanitization.
        7.  Later, the `testArgs` array is used to construct the command executed by `vscode.tasks.executeTask`.
        8.  Similar vulnerability exists for `deno.testing.args` setting, used in `client/src/tasks.ts` when building tasks, although the provided files do not show direct usage in `commands.ts`, tasks are related feature and configuration can influence tasks execution.

        ```typescript
        // File: client/src/tasks.ts, function: buildDenoTask
        export function buildDenoTask(
            target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
            process: string,
            definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
            name: string,
            args: string[], // Arguments are passed here, potentially including unsanitized user settings
            problemMatchers: string[],
        ): vscode.Task {
            const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
                process,
                args, // args are directly passed to ProcessExecution
                definition,
            );
        ```

        **Visualization:**

        ```
        User Settings (deno.codeLens.testArgs) --> config.get() --> testArgs Array --> Command Construction --> ProcessExecution (VSCode API) --> OS Command Execution
        ```

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  Create a new directory to act as a malicious workspace, e.g., `malicious-deno-workspace`.
        2.  Inside `malicious-deno-workspace`, create a `.vscode` directory.
        3.  Inside `.vscode`, create a `settings.json` file with the following content to inject a command to create a file named `pwned.txt` in the root of the workspace:
            ```json
            {
                "deno.enable": true,
                "deno.codeLens.testArgs": [
                    "--allow-all",
                    "; touch pwned.txt ; #"
                ]
            }
            ```
        4.  Create a simple Deno test file, e.g., `test.ts`, in `malicious-deno-workspace` with the following content:
            ```typescript
            Deno.test("simple test", () => {
                console.log("Running test");
            });
            ```
        5.  Open the `malicious-deno-workspace` in VSCode. Ensure the Deno extension is activated for this workspace.
        6.  In the `test.ts` file, locate the "â–¶ Run Test" Code Lens above the `Deno.test` declaration and click it.
        7.  Observe that after the test execution (even if the test passes or fails), a file named `pwned.txt` is created in the `malicious-deno-workspace` directory. This confirms command injection.
        8.  To test `deno.testing.args`, you can create a `tasks.json` file in `.vscode` directory:
            ```json
            {
                "version": "2.0.0",
                "tasks": [
                    {
                        "type": "deno",
                        "command": "test",
                        "label": "Deno: Run tests",
                        "problemMatcher": [
                            "$deno-test"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
            ```
            And modify `settings.json` to use `deno.testing.args`:
            ```json
            {
                "deno.enable": true,
                "deno.testing.args": [
                    "--allow-all",
                    "; touch pwned-task.txt ; #"
                ]
            }
            ```
        9.  Run the task "Deno: Run tests" from Tasks: Run Task menu.
        10. Observe that a file named `pwned-task.txt` is created in the `malicious-deno-workspace` directory, confirming command injection via `deno.testing.args`.
