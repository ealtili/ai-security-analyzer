### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: AI-Generated Malicious Code Injection
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a specific screenshot or video recording that subtly includes malicious code disguised as legitimate UI elements or user interactions. For example, an image might contain text that, when interpreted by the AI, translates into a JavaScript `onerror` handler with malicious code, or an HTML attribute like `onload` with an unwanted script. A video could demonstrate a user interaction within a seemingly safe UI, but in reality, the sequence of actions is designed to lead the AI to generate event handlers or scripts that execute malicious actions.
    2. The attacker uploads this crafted screenshot or video to the application through the user interface.
    3. The application's backend receives the image or video data and sends it to the AI model (like Claude, GPT-4, etc.) for processing.
    4. The AI model, interpreting the visual information from the input, generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code based on its understanding of the perceived web page or application UI in the screenshot or video.
    5. Due to the crafted nature of the input, the AI model inadvertently includes the malicious code within the generated output. This could be in the form of embedded JavaScript within event handlers, `<script>` tags, or HTML attributes that can execute scripts.
    6. The application returns this AI-generated code, including the injected malicious payload, to the user.
    7. A user, especially one who trusts the application or does not thoroughly review the generated code, might deploy or use this code.
    8. When a user opens or deploys the generated code (e.g., in a web browser or integrates it into their project), the malicious code is executed. This can lead to various attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), redirection to attacker-controlled sites, or other client-side exploits.

- Impact:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): If the generated code is deployed online, attackers could inject scripts to steal cookies, redirect users, deface websites, or perform actions on behalf of users.
    - Redirection to Malicious Websites: The generated code could redirect users to phishing sites or sites hosting malware, potentially leading to credential theft or malware infection.
    - Client-Side Code Execution: Malicious JavaScript could perform actions within the user's browser context, such as data exfiltration, browser hijacking, or further exploitation of client-side vulnerabilities.
    - Reputational Damage: If users deploy vulnerable code generated by the tool, and it's exploited, it can damage the reputation of both the user and the screenshot-to-code tool itself.
    - Supply Chain Risk: If developers integrate generated code into larger projects without review, they can unknowingly introduce security vulnerabilities into their own applications and systems.

- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The application currently lacks any input sanitization or output validation mechanisms to prevent the generation of malicious code. The documentation in `README.md` mentions "deploy the seemingly benign output without careful review", which implicitly advises users to manually review the code, but this is not a technical mitigation within the application itself.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization/Analysis: Implement a pre-processing step to analyze the input screenshot or video for suspicious patterns or code-like structures that are likely to be interpreted as code by the AI model and could be malicious. This is complex due to the nature of images and videos, and the variability of malicious encoding.
    - Output Sanitization: After the AI generates the code, implement a security scanning or sanitization process to automatically detect and remove or neutralize potentially malicious code patterns (e.g., `<script>` tags with external sources, event handlers with suspicious code, URL redirections, etc.) before presenting the code to the user. This needs to be balanced with preserving the functionality of the generated code.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP) Generation Guidance:  The application could guide users or even attempt to generate basic CSP directives that users can include in their HTML to mitigate potential XSS vulnerabilities in the generated code if deployed as a web application. However, this is a mitigation for the deployed code, not the generation process itself, and requires caution as AI-generated CSP could be incomplete or misconfigured.
    - User Education and Warnings: Display clear and prominent warnings to users about the inherent risks of using AI-generated code directly without thorough security review and testing. Emphasize that the tool is for rapid prototyping and code generation assistance, not for producing inherently secure, production-ready code without manual oversight. This warning is partially present in the README but should be reinforced within the application's UI.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have access to the application's interface to upload screenshots or video recordings. This is generally true for publicly accessible web applications.
    - The AI model used by the application must be susceptible to adversarial inputs that can influence it to generate unintended or malicious code. Current large language models are known to be susceptible to various forms of prompt injection and adversarial attacks, making this a realistic precondition.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Backend code in `backend/routes/generate_code.py` and `backend/llm.py` orchestrates the code generation process.
    - `backend/prompts/__init__.py` and `backend/prompts/*` define the prompts sent to the AI models, focusing on visual replication and code generation but not on security constraints or output sanitization.
    - The code generation flow takes user input (image/video), feeds it to the chosen LLM via the defined prompt, receives the generated code as a stream of text, and sends it back to the frontend through a websocket.
    - There is no code in the backend routes, LLM interaction logic, or utility functions that performs any kind of security analysis, sanitization, or validation of either the input image/video or the generated code.
    - The function `codegen.utils.extract_html_content` is used to extract HTML from the generated response but is purely for formatting and does not involve security checks.
    - The application relies entirely on the AI model's output and user's review without implementing any safeguards against AI-generated malicious code.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Craft a screenshot that visually represents a simple webpage but includes a subtly embedded malicious payload. For example, design a button that visually appears normal but has an attribute in the image text that could be interpreted as `onload="alert('XSS')"`.  Alternatively, in a video, simulate actions that lead to generation of a malicious handler in the generated code.
    2. Access the publicly hosted version of the screenshot-to-code application (e.g., `screenshottocode.com` or a locally run instance of the open-source version).
    3. Using the application's UI, upload the crafted screenshot.
    4. Choose any supported stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind) and select an AI model (e.g., Claude Sonnet 3.7 or GPT-4o).
    5. Initiate the code generation process.
    6. Once the code is generated, carefully examine the output HTML and JavaScript code in the application's interface. Look for the injected malicious payload, such as `<script>` tags executing unwanted code or event handlers like `onload`, `onerror`, `onclick` containing JavaScript that can execute `alert('XSS')` or redirect to an external site.
    7. Copy the generated code. Save it as an HTML file (e.g., `malicious_code.html`).
    8. Open `malicious_code.html` in a web browser.
    9. Observe if the malicious code executes. For instance, check if an alert box with 'XSS' appears, or if the page redirects to a different URL. If the malicious script executes, it confirms the AI-Generated Malicious Code Injection vulnerability.
