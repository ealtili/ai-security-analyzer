- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized AI-generated code

- Description:
    1. A malicious user crafts a screenshot or screen recording that, when processed by the AI model, leads to the generation of Javascript code containing a malicious payload.
    2. The user uploads this crafted screenshot or screen recording to the application.
    3. The backend processes the input using the AI model and generates frontend code (HTML, CSS, Javascript) based on the input.
    4. The backend sends the AI-generated code to the frontend without any sanitization or security checks.
    5. The frontend directly renders the received AI-generated code, including the malicious Javascript payload, in the user's browser.
    6. The malicious Javascript code executes in the context of the application's origin, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, session tokens, redirecting the user to a malicious website, or performing other malicious activities on behalf of the user.

- Impact:
    - Account Takeover: Attackers can potentially steal session cookies or access tokens, leading to account takeover.
    - Data Theft: Malicious scripts can access sensitive data within the application's context and transmit it to the attacker.
    - Redirection to Malicious Sites: Users can be redirected to attacker-controlled websites, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware infections.
    - Defacement: The application's frontend can be defaced, damaging the application's reputation and user trust.
    - Execution of Arbitrary Javascript: Attackers can execute arbitrary Javascript code in the user's browser, leading to a wide range of potential malicious activities.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. Based on the provided project files, there is no evidence of input sanitization or output encoding for the AI-generated code in the backend before sending it to the frontend. The prompts for AI models also do not include any instructions to avoid generating potentially harmful Javascript or to sanitize outputs.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: The backend should sanitize the input screenshots and screen recordings to remove or neutralize any potential malicious scripts or payloads before feeding them to the AI model. However, sanitizing image/video inputs to prevent malicious code generation is complex and may not be fully effective for this specific attack vector, as the vulnerability lies in the generated code itself.
    - Output Sanitization/Encoding: The backend must sanitize or encode the AI-generated code before sending it to the frontend. This is crucial to prevent the execution of malicious Javascript. Specifically, HTML entities encoding for special characters in the generated HTML and Javascript code should be implemented. For example, characters like `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, `&` should be replaced with their corresponding HTML entities.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implementing a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) can significantly mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities. CSP allows defining trusted sources of content and restricts the execution of inline Javascript. However, CSP might be difficult to implement in this project as the application's functionality relies on dynamically generated Javascript code. If CSP is implemented, it needs to be carefully configured to allow necessary Javascript while preventing malicious inline scripts.
    - Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Regularly auditing the code and performing penetration testing, specifically targeting XSS vulnerabilities, is essential to identify and address any potential security weaknesses.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs access to the application's functionality to upload screenshots or screen recordings.
    - The AI model must be susceptible to generating Javascript code based on the crafted malicious input.
    - The frontend must be directly rendering the AI-generated code without proper sanitization.

- Source Code Analysis:

    1. **`backend/routes/generate_code.py`:** This file handles the code generation process upon receiving a websocket request at the `/generate-code` endpoint.
    2. The `stream_code` function in `generate_code.py` is the entry point for handling code generation requests.
    3. **`extract_params` function:** This function extracts parameters from the websocket request, including `generatedCodeConfig` (stack), `inputMode`, `openAiApiKey`, `anthropicApiKey`, `openAiBaseURL`, and `isImageGenerationEnabled`. It does not perform any sanitization on these parameters, but these are mostly configuration and API keys, not directly related to the XSS payload itself.
    4. **`create_prompt` function (from `backend/prompts/__init__.py`):** This function assembles the prompt that is sent to the AI model. The prompt includes instructions to generate code based on the input image/video. The prompts in `backend\prompts\screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `backend\prompts\test_prompts.py`, `backend\prompts\claude_prompts.py`, and `backend\prompts\imported_code_prompts.py` instruct the AI to generate functional code, including Javascript, without any security constraints. For example, `REACT_TAILWIND_SYSTEM_PROMPT` explicitly instructs: "MAKE THE APP FUNCTIONAL using Javascript."
    5. **`stream_openai_response`, `stream_claude_response`, `stream_claude_response_native`, `stream_gemini_response` functions (in `backend/llm.py`):** These functions interact with the AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) to generate code based on the prompts. They receive the prompt messages and stream back the generated code in chunks via websocket.
    6. **`extract_html_content` function (in `backend/codegen/utils.py`):** This function extracts the HTML content from the AI-generated response using regular expressions.  *Crucially, this function does not perform any sanitization or encoding of the HTML content*.
    7. **`send_message` function (in `backend/routes/generate_code.py`):** This function sends messages back to the frontend via websocket, including the generated code with `type="setCode"`.  *The AI-generated code, after HTML extraction, is sent directly to the frontend without sanitization*.
    8. **Frontend Rendering (Assumed based on project description):** The frontend, built with React, is expected to receive the code via websocket and render it. If the frontend directly uses methods like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React (or similar methods in other frameworks) to render the received HTML without sanitization, it will execute any Javascript code embedded within the AI-generated HTML.

- Security Test Case:

    1. **Precondition:** Ensure you have a running instance of the application and can access the frontend. You also need to be able to upload a screenshot to trigger code generation.

    2. **Craft a Malicious Screenshot:** Create a screenshot that, when processed by the AI, is likely to generate Javascript code with a malicious payload. A simple example would be a screenshot of a webpage with a text input field and a button that, when "recreated" by the AI, includes Javascript to execute `alert('XSS Vulnerability')` or similar. You could also try to inject malicious Javascript within HTML attributes like `onload`, `onerror`, or event handlers if the AI model is likely to reproduce them. For example, create a screenshot that looks like a button with text "Click Me" and attempt to make the AI generate: `<button onclick="alert('XSS Vulnerability')">Click Me</button>`.

    3. **Upload the Malicious Screenshot:** On the application's frontend, use the screenshot-to-code functionality and upload the crafted malicious screenshot. Select any stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind).

    4. **Observe the Generated Code:** After the backend processes the screenshot and sends the generated code back to the frontend, carefully examine the generated code in the frontend (e.g., by inspecting the element in the browser's developer tools). Look for the injected Javascript payload in the generated HTML.

    5. **Execute the Generated Code:** If the frontend directly renders the generated code, the malicious Javascript payload will be executed in your browser. You should see an alert box with "XSS Vulnerability" (or your chosen payload) if the vulnerability is successfully exploited.

    6. **Verify XSS:** If the alert box appears, it confirms the XSS vulnerability. Further testing can be performed to explore the extent of the vulnerability and potential impact by trying more sophisticated payloads to steal cookies, redirect the page, or perform other malicious actions.

    7. **Example Payload in Screenshot Idea:** Create a very simple screenshot with just the text:  `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` . Upload this as a screenshot and see if the AI model and the application renders this literally in HTML output. If it does, the `onerror` event will trigger and execute `alert('XSS')`.

This list represents the identified XSS vulnerability based on the provided project files and the described attack vector. It is crucial to implement the missing mitigations to address this significant security risk.
