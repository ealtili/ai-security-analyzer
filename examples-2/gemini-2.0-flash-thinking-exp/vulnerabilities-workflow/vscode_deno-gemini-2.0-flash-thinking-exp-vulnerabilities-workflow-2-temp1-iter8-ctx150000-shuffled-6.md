- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Deno Tasks
- Description:
    - An attacker can craft a malicious `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` file within a Deno project.
    - This file can define Deno tasks with maliciously crafted commands or arguments.
    - When a user opens this project in VS Code with the Deno extension enabled, the extension reads and registers these tasks.
    - If the user then executes one of these malicious tasks, the injected commands will be executed by the Deno CLI on the user's machine.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the developer's machine.
    - This can lead to data exfiltration, installation of malware, or complete system compromise, depending on the permissions of the user running VS Code.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The extension appears to directly execute tasks defined in `deno.json` without any sanitization or validation of the commands or arguments.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The extension should sanitize or validate the `command` and `args` properties in task definitions from `deno.json` files to prevent command injection.
    - User confirmation: Before executing any task defined in `deno.json`, especially for newly opened workspaces, the extension should prompt the user to confirm execution, highlighting potential security risks.
    - Principle of least privilege: When executing tasks, the extension should consider running Deno CLI with restricted privileges if possible, although this might be complex to implement in VS Code extension context.
- Preconditions:
    - The victim must have the VS Code Deno extension installed and enabled.
    - The victim must open a Deno project containing a malicious `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` file.
    - The victim must manually execute a malicious task, either through the tasks sidebar or via command palette.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `client/src/tasks_sidebar.ts`
        - Function `readTaskDefinitions` in `client/src/util.ts` is used to parse `deno.json` and extract task definitions.
        - Class `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider` reads tasks and displays them in the VS Code tasks sidebar.
        - Command `deno.client.runTask` in `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider.#runTask` directly executes the `task.task` which is built from the parsed `deno.json` without any sanitization.
        - Function `buildDenoConfigTask` in `client/src/tasks.ts` constructs a `vscode.Task` directly from the configuration read from `deno.json`.
        - `vscode.ProcessExecution` is used to execute the task, which takes the `command` and `args` directly from the task definition.
    - File: `client/src/tasks.ts`
        - Function `buildDenoTask` and `buildDenoConfigTask` directly use the provided `command` and `args` from task definitions to create `vscode.Task` objects with `vscode.ProcessExecution`. There is no sanitization or validation applied to these inputs.

    // Visualization of vulnerable code path:

    deno.json/deno.jsonc --> readTaskDefinitions (client/src/util.ts) --> Task Definition Object --> DenoTasksTreeDataProvider (client/src/tasks_sidebar.ts) --> buildDenoConfigTask (client/src/tasks.ts) --> vscode.ProcessExecution --> Deno CLI command execution
    ```
- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Create a Deno project with a `deno.json` file.
    - Step 2: In `deno.json`, define a malicious task. For example:
        ```json
        {
          "tasks": {
            "maliciousTask": "echo 'Vulnerable!' && touch /tmp/pwned"
          }
        }
        ```
        For Windows, use a similar command like:
        ```json
        {
          "tasks": {
            "maliciousTask": "echo 'Vulnerable!' && type nul > C:\\pwned.txt"
          }
        }
        ```
    - Step 3: Open this project in VS Code with the Deno extension enabled.
    - Step 4: Open the tasks sidebar (if visible) or use the command palette to list Deno tasks. The "maliciousTask" should be listed.
    - Step 5: Execute the "maliciousTask" by clicking the run button in the tasks sidebar or using the command palette.
    - Step 6: Observe the execution of the injected command. In this example, a file named `pwned` should be created in `/tmp` (or `C:\pwned.txt` on Windows) and "Vulnerable!" should be printed in the task output. This confirms arbitrary command execution.
