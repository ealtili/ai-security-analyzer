- Vulnerability Name: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code due to Unsanitized User Input via Screenshot

- Description:
    1. A malicious actor crafts a screenshot of a website design.
    2. This crafted screenshot includes text content that contains a JavaScript payload, for example, within a `<div>` element: `<div id="xss"><h1>Malicious Title</h1><img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')"></div>`.
    3. The user uploads this malicious screenshot to the application.
    4. The backend processes the screenshot using an AI model to generate code based on the visual design and text content in the image.
    5. The AI model, when generating code, includes the text content from the screenshot, including the malicious JavaScript payload, directly into the generated HTML code without sanitization.
    6. A user then implements or interacts with this generated code.
    7. When the generated code is rendered in a web browser, the malicious JavaScript payload from the screenshot executes, leading to XSS. For example, the `alert('XSS')` will be executed in the user's browser.

- Impact:
    *   If a user uses the generated code in their web application, any visitor to their application could be exposed to the XSS vulnerability.
    *   An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to:
        *   Session hijacking: Stealing session cookies to gain unauthorized access to the user's account on the vulnerable application.
        *   Credential theft: Prompting the user for login credentials (username and password) and sending them to a malicious server.
        *   Defacement: Changing the visual appearance of the web page.
        *   Redirection: Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
        *   Malware distribution: Infecting the user's computer with malware.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    *   None identified in the provided PROJECT FILES. The code generation process appears to directly translate text content from screenshots into code without any sanitization.

- Missing mitigations:
    *   **Input Sanitization:** The application should sanitize the text extracted from the screenshot before passing it to the AI model and before including it in the generated code. This would involve removing or encoding any potentially malicious JavaScript or HTML tags.
    *   **Output Encoding:** The generated code, especially any text content derived from the screenshot, should be properly encoded before being rendered in the browser. For HTML output, this means using HTML entity encoding for characters that have special meaning in HTML (like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a strict CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources. However, CSP is not a complete solution against XSS, especially reflected XSS, and should be used in conjunction with input sanitization and output encoding.

- Preconditions:
    *   An attacker needs to be able to craft a screenshot containing malicious JavaScript code embedded within the text content of the image.
    *   A user needs to upload this malicious screenshot to the application and use the generated code in a web browser.

- Source code analysis:
    *   **`backend\prompts\screenshot_system_prompts.py` and `backend\prompts\imported_code_prompts.py`**: These files define system prompts for the AI models. While these prompts themselves do not introduce XSS, they instruct the AI to "Use the exact text from the screenshot." and "Pay close attention to text color, font size, font family... Match the colors and sizes exactly.". This instruction encourages the AI model to directly transcribe and include the text content from the screenshot into the generated code, including any malicious scripts embedded within that text, without sanitization.
    *   **`backend\evals\core.py` and `backend\llm.py`**: These files handle the interaction with the AI models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini). The function `generate_code_core` in `backend\evals\core.py` calls `stream_openai_response`, `stream_claude_response`, or `stream_gemini_response` in `backend\llm.py` to get the code from the LLM. The response from the LLM, which includes the generated code, is directly returned by `generate_code_core` and is later used as the application's output. There is no evidence of sanitization or encoding of the generated code within these files or any other provided backend files before it's returned to the frontend.
    *   **`backend\routes\generate_code.py`**: This file handles the `/generate-code` websocket endpoint. It orchestrates the code generation process. The code retrieves the AI-generated code and uses `extract_html_content` function from `codegen.utils.py` to process the completion. Review of this file and the surrounding code shows no evidence of any sanitization or encoding of the AI-generated code before it is sent to the frontend via websocket. It directly sends the output of `extract_html_content` to the frontend. Assuming that `extract_html_content` in `codegen\utils.py` is designed to extract HTML content and not to sanitize it (based on its name and common utility function patterns), this confirms the lack of output sanitization.
    *   **`backend\routes\evals.py`**: This file provides routes for evaluating generated code, including retrieving and comparing outputs. It reads generated HTML code from files for evaluation purposes. This file does not implement any sanitization for the generated code; it primarily focuses on managing and serving evaluation datasets and results. The vulnerability persists in the generated code itself, which is then used in these evaluations.
    *   **Other backend files**:  `backend\main.py`, `backend\routes\screenshot.py`, `backend\routes\home.py`, `backend\evals\runner.py`, `backend\video_to_app.py`, `backend\start.py`, `backend\run_evals.py`, `backend\run_image_generation_evals.py`, `backend\codegen\utils.py`, `backend\debug\DebugFileWriter.py`, `backend\evals\config.py`, `backend\evals\utils.py`, `backend\fs_logging\core.py`, `backend\image_generation\core.py`, `backend\image_generation\replicate.py`, `backend\image_processing\utils.py`, `backend\mock_llm.py`, `backend\prompts\claude_prompts.py`, `backend\prompts\imported_code_prompts.py`, `backend\prompts\test_prompts.py`, `backend\prompts\types.py`, `backend\utils.py`, `backend\video\utils.py`, `backend\ws\constants.py`, `backend\custom_types.py`, `backend\pyproject.toml`, `backend\Dockerfile`, `backend\docker-compose.yml`, `backend\README.md`, `design-docs.md`, `Evaluation.md`, `README.md`, `Troubleshooting.md`, `blog\evaluating-claude.md`, `backend\config.py`, `frontend\Dockerfile`: These files provide configurations, utility functions, documentation, and other supporting functionalities but do not implement XSS mitigation in the code generation pipeline.

                                                     |                                         v
                                                     ------------------------------------------
                                                                Generated Code (Potentially Malicious)
    ```
    The data flow shows that the screenshot image (user input) is processed by the backend, sent to the AI model, and the generated code is returned without sanitization. The system prompts instruct the AI to preserve the text content, which, when combined with the lack of sanitization, creates the XSS vulnerability.

- Security test case:
    1.  **Prepare a malicious screenshot:**
        *   Create a simple image (e.g., using an online image editor or a basic HTML page and screenshotting it).
        *   Embed the following HTML code within the image as text content, for example, within a `div` element in the design: `<div id="xss_test"><h1>Test Title</h1><img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS_Vulnerability_Test')"></div>`. Ensure the text is clearly visible in the screenshot. Save the image as `malicious_screenshot.png`.
    2.  **Start the application:**
        *   Run the backend and frontend of the screenshot-to-code application according to the instructions in the `README.md` file. Ensure the application is accessible in a browser (e.g., at `http://localhost:5173`).
    3.  **Upload the malicious screenshot:**
        *   Open the application in a web browser.
        *   Use the application's UI to upload the `malicious_screenshot.png`.
        *   Select any supported stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind).
        *   Initiate the code generation process.
    4.  **Examine the generated code:**
        *   After the code is generated, download or inspect the generated code (depending on UI features, this might be displayed in the UI or downloadable).
        *   Look for the embedded malicious JavaScript payload `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS_Vulnerability_Test')">` within the generated HTML code. It should be present exactly as it was in the screenshot's text content, without HTML entity encoding or sanitization.
    5.  **Implement and run the generated code:**
        *   Copy the generated HTML code.
        *   Create a new HTML file (e.g., `test_xss.html`) and paste the generated code into it.
        *   Open `test_xss.html` in a web browser.
    6.  **Verify XSS execution:**
        *   When the `test_xss.html` page loads in the browser, an alert box with the message "XSS_Vulnerability_Test" should appear. This confirms that the JavaScript code from the malicious screenshot was executed, demonstrating a reflected XSS vulnerability in the AI-generated code.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the generated code through a crafted screenshot, which can then be executed when a user uses the generated code, leading to Cross-Site Scripting.
