### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Deno Tasks

* Description:
    1. A threat actor creates a malicious repository containing a `deno.json` or `tasks.json` file.
    2. This configuration file defines a Deno task with a malicious command. For example, a task could be defined to execute arbitrary shell commands.
    3. A victim opens this malicious repository in Visual Studio Code with the "Deno for VSCode" extension installed and enabled for the workspace.
    4. The extension parses the `deno.json` or `tasks.json` file and registers the defined tasks in the Deno Tasks sidebar.
    5. The victim, unaware of the malicious task, may attempt to run or debug this task from the Deno Tasks sidebar.
    6. When the victim executes the malicious task, the extension uses `vscode.ProcessExecution` to run the command.
    7. Due to the lack of sanitization of the task command and arguments, the malicious command from the `deno.json` or `tasks.json` file is executed by the system shell.
    8. This allows the threat actor to achieve arbitrary command execution on the victim's machine.

* Impact:
    Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This could lead to data theft, malware installation, or complete system compromise.

* Vulnerability Rank: critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    No mitigations are currently implemented in the project to prevent command injection in Deno tasks. The extension directly uses the command and arguments defined in `deno.json` or `tasks.json` without any sanitization or validation.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The extension should sanitize or validate the task commands and arguments defined in `deno.json` and `tasks.json` files to prevent command injection.
    - Sandboxing or command whitelisting: Instead of directly executing shell commands, consider using a sandboxed environment or whitelisting allowed commands to restrict the capabilities of Deno tasks.
    - User awareness and warnings: Display clear warnings to the user when tasks from external repositories are about to be executed, especially if they involve shell commands.

* Preconditions:
    1. The victim has the "Deno for VSCode" extension installed and enabled.
    2. The victim opens a malicious repository containing a crafted `deno.json` or `tasks.json` file in VSCode.
    3. The malicious repository defines a Deno task with a command intended for command injection.
    4. The victim attempts to run or debug the malicious Deno task from the Deno Tasks sidebar.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`client\src\tasks.ts`**:
        - The functions `buildDenoTask` and `buildDenoConfigTask` are responsible for creating `vscode.Task` objects.
        - These functions use `vscode.ProcessExecution` to define how the tasks are executed.
        - `vscode.ProcessExecution` takes a `process` (command) and `args` as input.
        - In `buildDenoTask`, the `command` and `args` are directly taken from the `DenoTaskDefinition` provided as input:
        ```typescript
        export function buildDenoTask(
          target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
          process: string,
          definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
          name: string,
          args: string[],
          problemMatchers: string[],
        ): vscode.Task {
          const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
            process, // command from definition
            args,    // args from definition
            definition,
          );
          // ...
        }
        ```
        - In `buildDenoConfigTask`, the command is constructed and arguments are partially controlled by the `deno.json` content (`name` which becomes task name):
        ```typescript
        export function buildDenoConfigTask(
          scope: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
          process: string,
          name: string, // task name from deno.json
          command: string | undefined, // command description from deno.json
          sourceUri?: vscode.Uri,
        ): vscode.Task {
          const args = [];
          // ...
          args.push(name); // task name from deno.json used as arg
          const task = new vscode.Task(
            {
              type: TASK_TYPE,
              name: name, // task name from deno.json
              command: "task",
              args,
              sourceUri,
            },
            scope,
            name, // task name from deno.json
            TASK_SOURCE,
            new vscode.ProcessExecution(process, ["task", ...args]), // process and args used directly
            ["$deno"],
          );
          task.detail = `$ ${command}`;
          return task;
        }
        ```
    2. **`client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`**:
        - `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider` and `DenoTaskProvider` are responsible for fetching and displaying tasks.
        - `DenoTaskProvider.provideTasks()` fetches tasks by sending a request `"deno/taskDefinitions"` to the language server:
        ```typescript
        const configTasks = await client.sendRequest(taskReq);
        ```
        - The response from the language server (`configTasks`) contains task definitions, which are then used to build `vscode.Task` objects using `buildDenoConfigTask`.
        - The language server is responsible for parsing `deno.json` and `tasks.json` and providing these task definitions. If these files are malicious, the command injection can occur.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new directory named `malicious-deno-repo`.
    2. Inside `malicious-deno-repo`, create a file named `deno.jsonc` with the following content to define a malicious task:
        ```jsonc
        {
          "tasks": {
            "maliciousTask": "echo pwned > /tmp/pwned && echo 'Malicious task executed!'"
          }
        }
        ```
        *(Note: For Windows, replace `/tmp/pwned` with `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\pwned.txt` or similar)*
    3. Open Visual Studio Code and open the `malicious-deno-repo` folder.
    4. Ensure the "Deno for VSCode" extension is enabled for this workspace (you might be prompted to enable it, or you can enable it manually).
    5. Open the Deno Tasks sidebar by clicking on the Deno icon in the Activity Bar (if visible) or by using the command palette and searching for "Deno Tasks".
    6. In the Deno Tasks sidebar, you should see the "maliciousTask" listed under the `deno.jsonc` file.
    7. Right-click on "maliciousTask" and select "Run Task".
    8. Observe the output in the terminal. You should see "Malicious task executed!".
    9. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` (or `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\pwned.txt` on Windows) has been created. If the file exists and contains "pwned", the command injection is successful.

    This test case demonstrates that a malicious user can inject arbitrary commands into the task execution flow by crafting a malicious `deno.jsonc` file, leading to Remote Code Execution when a victim runs the defined task.
