Based on your evaluation and the provided criteria, the described potential vulnerability does not meet the requirements for inclusion in the list.  Specifically, it is:

- **Not completely described:**  It lacks source code analysis and a security test case.
- **Theoretical:** It is presented as a potential scenario without concrete evidence of an actual, exploitable vulnerability in the Deno CLI and a confirmed exploit path through the extension.

Therefore, according to the instructions to exclude vulnerabilities that are not completely described, are only theoretical, and return an empty list if no input vulnerabilities are matching conditions, the updated vulnerability list should be empty.
