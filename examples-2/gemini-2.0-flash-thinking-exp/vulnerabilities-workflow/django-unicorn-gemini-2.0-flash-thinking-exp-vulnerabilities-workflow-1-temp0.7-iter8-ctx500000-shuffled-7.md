Please provide the list of vulnerabilities you want me to update. I need the list to be able to filter and format it according to your instructions.

Once you provide the list, I will go through each vulnerability and:

1. **Check if it should be excluded** based on:
    * Being caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns when using project files.
    * Being only a missing documentation issue.
    * Being a denial of service vulnerability.
2. **Check if it should be included** based on:
    * Being valid and not already mitigated.
    * Having a vulnerability rank of at least "high" (high or critical).
3. **For the included vulnerabilities, I will format them in markdown** and keep the existing descriptions for:
    * vulnerability name
    * description
    * impact
    * vulnerability rank
    * currently implemented mitigations
    * missing mitigations
    * preconditions
    * source code analysis
    * security test case

Looking forward to receiving the list of vulnerabilities so I can help you!
