## Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unintended Exposure of Mock LLM Responses in Production

- **Description:**
    1. The backend application uses an environment variable `MOCK` to control whether to use mock LLM responses.
    2. When `MOCK` is set to `true`, the backend, specifically in `backend/llm.py`, utilizes mock LLM responses from `backend/mock_llm.py` instead of calling external LLM APIs like OpenAI or Anthropic.
    3. If the `MOCK` environment variable is mistakenly set to `true` in a production deployment, the application will serve static, pre-defined responses.
    4. An external attacker interacting with the publicly accessible application will receive these mock responses, expecting AI-generated code.
    5. This exposes internal application behavior, including sample code snippets, logic, and potentially sensitive placeholder content intended only for development and testing purposes.

- **Impact:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** Mock responses can reveal internal application structure, features under development, example code implementations, and comments intended for internal use. This information can aid an attacker in understanding the application's inner workings, potentially facilitating further attacks.
    - **Misleading Functionality:** Users will experience misleading outputs that do not reflect the application's advertised AI-powered capabilities. This can erode user trust and negatively impact the perceived value of the application.
    - **Reduced Security Posture:** While not a direct breach, exposure of mock responses weakens the security posture by leaking internal details, which, when combined with other vulnerabilities, could assist an attacker in more effectively targeting the system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The application utilizes environment variables for configuration, which is a standard and generally secure practice for managing configuration settings across different environments.
    - The `MOCK` variable is intended for development and debugging, indicating an awareness of the need to separate testing from production behavior.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Production Environment Check & Enforcement:** The application lacks a mechanism to detect if it's running in a production environment and enforce that `MOCK` is set to `false` or unset. A startup check could verify the environment and issue a warning or refuse to start if `MOCK=true` in production.
    - **Startup Warning/Error Logging:** There is no logging or warning message at application startup to indicate if the application is running in mock mode. This would immediately alert administrators to a misconfiguration.
    - **Explicit Documentation Warning:** While the README might mention mock mode, it should include a clear and prominent warning against enabling mock mode in production, explicitly outlining the security risks and information disclosure implications.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The application is deployed in a production environment.
    - The `MOCK` environment variable is unintentionally or maliciously set to `true` during deployment or configuration of the backend service.
    - An external attacker interacts with the publicly accessible frontend of the application.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`backend/config.py` (from previous analysis):**
        ```python
        SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE = bool(os.environ.get("MOCK", False))
        ```
        This code reads the `MOCK` environment variable. If `MOCK` is set to any truthy value (e.g., "true", "1", "yes"), `SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE` becomes `True`.  The default value is `False` if the `MOCK` variable is not set or set to a falsy value.
    2. **`backend/llm.py` (from previous analysis):**
        ```python
        from config import SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE
        from backend.mock_llm import mock_completion
        # ...
        async def get_completion_streaming(...):
            if SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE:
                return await mock_completion(process_chunk, input_mode)
            # ... rest of the function that calls actual LLM APIs
        ```
        This snippet demonstrates that the `SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE` boolean, configured via the `MOCK` environment variable, directly dictates whether the application uses mock responses by calling `mock_completion` or proceeds to use real LLM APIs.
    3. **`backend/mock_llm.py` (from previous analysis):**
        This file contains static mock responses, including HTML code snippets like `APPLE_MOCK_CODE`, `NYTIMES_MOCK_CODE`, etc. These are returned when `SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE` is `True`.
    4. **`backend/routes/generate_code.py`:**
        ```python
        from config import SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE
        from mock_llm import mock_completion
        # ...
        if SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE:
            completion_results = [
                await mock_completion(process_chunk, input_mode=input_mode)
            ]
            completions = [result["code"] for result in completion_results]
        else:
            # ... code to call actual LLM APIs ...
        ```
        This section within the `stream_code` websocket route in `generate_code.py` confirms that the `SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE` flag is checked to decide whether to use mock responses or real LLM calls. If `SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE` is true, `mock_completion` is called, serving the static mock data.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Environment Variable MOCK=true --> backend/config.py (SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE = True) --> backend/llm.py or backend/routes/generate_code.py (if SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE: use mock_completion) --> backend/mock_llm.py (serve static mock code) --> User receives mock code instead of AI generated code
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Deploy the `screenshot-to-code` application in a test or staging environment that closely mirrors a production setup.
    2. **Action:** During the deployment or configuration phase of the backend service, set the environment variable `MOCK` to `true`. Ensure this setting is active when the application starts.
    3. **Action:** Access the publicly available frontend of the deployed application (e.g., via its public URL or `http://localhost:5173` if local).
    4. **Action:** Interact with the application as a typical user would. For example, upload a screenshot of a webpage or provide a URL for code generation.
    5. **Verification:** Examine the generated code output. Confirm that the code matches one of the pre-defined mock code snippets found in `backend/mock_llm.py` (e.g., `NYTIMES_MOCK_CODE`, `APPLE_MOCK_CODE`, etc.). The output should be consistent and static, regardless of the input screenshot or URL. For instance, repeatedly uploading different screenshots might consistently yield the NYTimes mock code.
    6. **Expected Result:** The application should serve static mock code from `backend/mock_llm.py` because `MOCK=true` was set. This successfully demonstrates the vulnerability: the unintended exposure of mock responses in a production-like environment due to a simple misconfiguration.
