### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Command Injection in Deno Tasks

* **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in Deno Tasks
* **Description:**
    1. A threat actor can create a malicious repository.
    2. In the malicious repository, the threat actor crafts a `tasks.json` or `deno.json` file that defines a Deno task with malicious arguments in the `args` property of the task definition.
    3. A victim clones or opens this malicious repository in VSCode with the Deno extension installed and enabled.
    4. The victim may be tricked into running the malicious task, either directly from the Tasks sidebar or via other means.
    5. When the task is executed, the Deno extension uses `vscode.ProcessExecution` to run the Deno CLI command with the user-provided arguments from the task definition.
    6. Due to insufficient sanitization of the `args` property, the threat actor's malicious commands embedded in the arguments are executed by the system shell.
* **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.
* **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    No mitigations are currently implemented in the project to prevent command injection in Deno tasks. The extension directly uses user-provided arguments in `vscode.ProcessExecution` without sanitization.
* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization: The extension should sanitize the `args` property of the Deno task definition to prevent command injection. This could involve disallowing shell metacharacters or using a safer method of command execution that avoids shell interpretation.
    - User awareness and warnings: Display a clear warning to the user when a task from an external repository is about to be executed, especially if it contains arguments. Encourage users to review task definitions from untrusted sources carefully.
    - Principle of least privilege: While harder to implement in this context, consider if there are ways to limit the privileges of the executed Deno tasks.
* **Preconditions:**
    1. Victim has VSCode with the Deno extension installed and enabled.
    2. Victim opens a malicious repository containing crafted task definitions.
    3. Victim executes a malicious Deno task from the repository.
* **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`client\src\tasks.ts`:** The `buildDenoTask` function constructs a `vscode.Task` using `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
    ```typescript
    export function buildDenoTask(
      target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
      process: string,
      definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
      name: string,
      args: string[], // User-provided arguments
      problemMatchers: string[],
    ): vscode.Task {
      const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
        process,
        args, // Directly using user-provided args without sanitization
        definition,
      );

      return new vscode.Task(
        definition,
        target,
        name,
        TASK_SOURCE,
        exec,
        problemMatchers,
      );
    }
    ```
    2. **`docs\tasks.md`:**  The documentation shows that `args` in `DenoTaskDefinition` are passed as command-line arguments, implying they are directly used in shell execution.
    ```typescript
    interface DenoTaskDefinition {
      type: "deno";
      // This is the `deno` command to run (e.g. `run`, `test`, `cache`, etc.)
      command: string;
      // Additional arguments pass on the command line
      args?: string[]; // User-provided arguments are defined here
      // ...
    }
    ```
    3. **`client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`:** The `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider.#runTask` function executes the task using `tasks.executeTask`, which in turn uses the `vscode.ProcessExecution` created in `buildDenoTask`.

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a malicious repository with a `tasks.json` file in the root.
        - The `tasks.json` should contain a task definition with a command injection vulnerability. For example:
        ```json
        {
          "version": "2.0.0",
          "tasks": [
            {
              "type": "deno",
              "command": "run",
              "args": [
                "mod.ts",
                "; touch /tmp/pwned" // Malicious command injection
              ],
              "problemMatcher": [
                "$deno"
              ],
              "label": "deno: run with injection"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
        - Create a simple `mod.ts` file:
        ```typescript
        console.log("Hello from mod.ts");
        ```
        - Host this repository publicly (e.g., on GitHub).
    2. **Victim Actions:**
        - Victim clones the malicious repository to their local machine.
        - Victim opens the cloned repository in VSCode with the Deno extension enabled.
        - Victim opens the Tasks sidebar in VSCode.
        - Victim locates and executes the "deno: run with injection" task.
    3. **Verification:**
        - After executing the task, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on the victim's machine.
        - If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created, it confirms that the command injection was successful and arbitrary commands could be executed.
