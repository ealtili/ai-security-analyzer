### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Workspace Settings (`deno.path`)
* Description:
    1. An attacker creates a malicious workspace folder.
    2. Inside this workspace, the attacker creates a `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    3. In this `settings.json`, the attacker sets the `deno.path` configuration to point to a malicious executable under their control. For example: `"deno.path": "/path/to/malicious/deno.sh"`.
    4. The attacker tricks a victim into opening this malicious workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension installed and enabled.
    5. When the Deno extension initializes or attempts to use the Deno CLI (e.g., for linting, formatting, testing, or any other Deno command execution within VS Code), it reads the `deno.path` setting from the workspace settings.
    6. The extension then executes the program specified in `deno.path`. Because the attacker has set this to a malicious executable, their code is executed on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.
* Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The attacker can gain full control over the victim's machine, steal sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension reads and uses the `deno.path` setting without any validation or sanitization.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `deno.path` setting. The extension should verify that the path points to a legitimate Deno executable and potentially restrict the path to be within expected locations or disallow execution of scripts.
    - Display a warning to the user when a workspace setting overrides `deno.path`, especially if it points to an unusual or user-writable location.
    - Consider using `deno` from the environment path as the default and only allow `deno.path` setting to point to a location within the user's home directory or other trusted locations after explicit user consent and validation.
    - Implement a mechanism to detect if the executable at `deno.path` is actually a Deno CLI executable to prevent pointing to arbitrary programs.
* Preconditions:
    - The victim has the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension installed and enabled.
    - The victim opens a workspace folder controlled by the attacker.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`client\src\util.ts:getDenoCommandPath()`**: This function is responsible for determining the path to the Deno executable.
    ```typescript
    // File: ..\vscode_deno\client\src\util.ts
    export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
      const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath(); // [HIGHLIGHT] Reads deno.path from workspace config
      const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
      if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
        return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
      } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
        // ... (relative path resolution logic) ...
        return undefined;
      } else {
        return command; // [HIGHLIGHT] Returns the path directly without validation
      }
    }

    function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
      const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)
        .get<string>("path"); // [HIGHLIGHT] Reads "deno.path" setting
      // ... (empty path handling) ...
      return exePath;
    }
    ```
    - `getDenoCommandPath()` first calls `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` to retrieve the `deno.path` setting from the workspace configuration using `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string>("path")`.
    - If `deno.path` is set and is an absolute path, `getDenoCommandPath()` directly returns this path without any validation.

    2. **`client\src\tasks.ts:buildDenoTask()` and `client\src\debug_config_provider.ts:DenoDebugConfigurationProvider`**: These files use the path obtained from `getDenoCommandPath()` to execute Deno CLI commands.

    ```typescript
    // File: ..\vscode_deno\client\src\tasks.ts
    export function buildDenoTask(
      target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
      process: string, // [HIGHLIGHT] "process" argument is used as executable path
      definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
      name: string,
      args: string[],
      problemMatchers: string[],
    ): vscode.Task {
      const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
        process, // [HIGHLIGHT] Executable path used directly in ProcessExecution
        args,
        definition,
      );
      // ...
      return new vscode.Task(...);
    }
    ```
    - `buildDenoTask()` in `tasks.ts` takes `process` as an argument, which is the Deno executable path obtained from `getDenoCommandName()` (which calls `getDenoCommandPath()`). This `process` path is directly used in `vscode.ProcessExecution` to execute the task.

    ```typescript
    // File: ..\vscode_deno\client\src\debug_config_provider.ts
    runtimeExecutable: await getDenoCommandName(), // [HIGHLIGHT] Gets deno command path
    runtimeArgs: [
      "run",
      ...this.#getAdditionalRuntimeArgs(),
      this.#getInspectArg(),
      "--allow-all",
    ],
    ```
    - Similarly, `DenoDebugConfigurationProvider` in `debug_config_provider.ts` uses `getDenoCommandName()` to get the Deno executable path and sets it as `runtimeExecutable` in the debug configuration.

    **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        subgraph VS Code Extension
            A[vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("deno").get("path")] --> B(getDenoCommandPath);
            B --> C{Is deno.path Absolute?};
            C -- Yes --> D[Return deno.path];
            C -- No --> E(getDefaultDenoCommand);
            E --> D;
            D --> F(buildDenoTask / DenoDebugConfigurationProvider);
            F --> G[vscode.ProcessExecution(denoPath, ...)];
            G --> H[Execute Process];
        end
        subgraph Malicious Workspace
            I[.vscode/settings.json] --> J["deno.path": "/path/to/malicious/deno.sh"];
        end
        J --> A;
        H -- Executes Malicious Code --> K[Victim Machine Compromised];
    ```

    **Conclusion:** The code directly uses the `deno.path` setting from workspace configuration without any validation, leading to arbitrary code execution if an attacker provides a malicious path.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Executable:**
        - Create a new directory named `malicious-deno`.
        - Inside `malicious-deno`, create a file named `deno.sh` (or `deno.bat` for Windows).
        - Make `deno.sh` executable (`chmod +x deno.sh`).
        - Add the following malicious script to `deno.sh`:
          ```bash
          #!/bin/bash
          echo "Malicious script executed!"
          echo "Attacker controlled deno.path!"
          # Example malicious action: Create a file in /tmp
          touch /tmp/pwned.txt
          exit 1 # Exit with an error to avoid further execution
          ```
          (For Windows `deno.bat`):
          ```batch
          @echo off
          echo Malicious script executed!
          echo Attacker controlled deno.path!
          REM Example malicious action: Create a file in %TEMP%
          echo > %TEMP%\pwned.txt
          exit /b 1
          ```
    2. **Create Malicious Workspace:**
        - Create a new directory named `malicious-workspace`.
        - Inside `malicious-workspace`, create a directory named `.vscode`.
        - Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json`.
        - Add the following configuration to `settings.json`, adjusting the path to `deno.sh` to the absolute path of your `malicious-deno` directory:
          ```json
          {
              "deno.path": "/path/to/malicious-deno/deno.sh"
          }
          ```
          (For Windows, adjust path to `deno.bat` and use Windows path style):
          ```json
          {
              "deno.path": "C:\\path\\to\\malicious-deno\\deno.bat"
          }
          ```
        - Create an empty TypeScript file named `test.ts` in `malicious-workspace`.
    3. **Open Workspace in VS Code:**
        - Open Visual Studio Code.
        - Open the `malicious-workspace` folder using "File" -> "Open Folder...".
        - Ensure the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension is enabled for this workspace (if not already enabled globally, you might need to enable it for the workspace by running the "Deno: Enable" command).
    4. **Trigger Deno Extension Execution:**
        - Open the `test.ts` file in the editor. This should trigger the Deno extension to initialize and potentially attempt to use the Deno CLI based on workspace settings. You can also manually trigger a Deno command like "Deno: Cache" from the command palette.
    5. **Verify Malicious Code Execution:**
        - Check for the output "Malicious script executed!" in the VS Code output panel (you might need to look at the "Deno Language Server" output if the malicious script exits too quickly).
        - Verify that the `/tmp/pwned.txt` file (or `%TEMP%\pwned.txt` on Windows) has been created, confirming that the malicious script was executed.
    6. **Expected Result:** The malicious script `deno.sh` should execute when the Deno extension attempts to use the Deno CLI, demonstrating arbitrary code execution due to the insecure `deno.path` setting. The output panel and the creation of `pwned.txt` file are indicators of successful exploitation.
