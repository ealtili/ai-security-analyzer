### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious screenshot or design that, when processed by the AI model, results in the generation of HTML code containing embedded JavaScript.
    2. The user uploads this crafted screenshot to the application.
    3. The backend processes the screenshot using an AI model (like Claude or GPT-4o) to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
    4. The AI model, if not specifically instructed and constrained, might inadvertently or intentionally include malicious JavaScript within the generated HTML output based on the input screenshot.
    5. The backend, specifically in `backend/routes/generate_code.py`, receives the AI-generated code and uses `extract_html_content` from `backend/utils.py` to extract the HTML part.
    6. The backend then sends this extracted HTML code directly to the frontend via a WebSocket connection without any sanitization or validation.
    7. The frontend receives the HTML code and renders it in the user's browser, likely within an iframe or similar mechanism to display the generated output.
    8. If the generated HTML contains malicious JavaScript, this script will be executed in the user's browser when the HTML is rendered, leading to XSS.

* Impact:
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
    - **Data theft**: The attacker can steal session cookies, access tokens, or other sensitive information stored in the user's browser.
    - **Account takeover**: By stealing session cookies or access tokens, the attacker might be able to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to their account within the application or related services.
    - **Malware distribution**: The attacker can redirect the user to malicious websites or inject code that downloads malware onto the user's system.
    - **Defacement**: The attacker can modify the content of the web page displayed in the user's browser, potentially defacing the application's interface.
    - **Redirection**: The attacker can redirect the user to phishing pages or other malicious sites.
    - **Execution of arbitrary JavaScript**: The attacker can execute any JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser session, limited by the Same-Origin Policy but still capable of significant harm.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided code does not include any explicit sanitization or Content Security Policy (CSP) mechanisms to prevent XSS in the AI-generated code. The `extract_html_content` function in `backend/utils.py` only extracts HTML and does not perform any sanitization.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **HTML Sanitization:** Implement a robust HTML sanitization library in the backend (e.g., Bleach in Python) to process the AI-generated HTML code before sending it to the frontend. This sanitization should remove or neutralize any potentially malicious JavaScript or HTML elements.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a Content Security Policy in the frontend to restrict the sources from which resources (like JavaScript) can be loaded and to disable inline JavaScript execution. This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.
    - **Input Validation and Encoding at AI Prompt Level:**  While not a direct mitigation in the code, carefully crafting prompts for AI models to discourage the generation of `<script>` tags or inline event handlers can reduce the likelihood of XSS payload generation. However, this is not a reliable mitigation on its own.
    - **Regular Security Audits and Testing:** Regularly audit the code and the AI model's output for potential XSS vulnerabilities. Implement security testing, including fuzzing with potentially malicious inputs, to identify and address weaknesses.

* Preconditions:
    - The application must be running and accessible.
    - The attacker needs to be able to craft or manipulate a screenshot or design input that can cause the AI model to generate malicious JavaScript code within the HTML output.
    - The user must upload and process this crafted screenshot using the application.
    - The frontend must render the HTML code received from the backend without proper sanitization.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `backend/routes/generate_code.py`**:
       - The `@router.websocket("/generate-code")` function handles WebSocket connections and code generation requests.
       - It receives parameters from the frontend, including the screenshot (`params: dict[str, str]`).
       - It calls `create_prompt` to prepare prompts for the AI model.
       - It uses `stream_openai_response` or `stream_claude_response` to get AI-generated code.
       - The generated code is then processed by `extract_html_content(completion)` function.
       - **Vulnerable Point**: The extracted HTML code is directly sent to the frontend using `await send_message("setCode", updated_html, index)` without any sanitization.

    ```python
    # backend/routes/generate_code.py

    @router.websocket("/generate-code")
    async def stream_code(websocket: WebSocket):
        # ...
        completions = [extract_html_content(completion) for completion in completions] # Extracts HTML
        # ...
        for index, updated_html in enumerate(updated_completions):
            await send_message("setCode", updated_html, index) # Sends unsanitized HTML to frontend
        # ...
    ```

    2. **File: `backend/utils.py`**:
       - The `extract_html_content(text: str)` function uses a regular expression to extract content within `<html>` tags.
       - **Not a Mitigation**: This function only extracts HTML and does not perform any sanitization. It's intended to parse the HTML structure, not to secure it.

    ```python
    # backend/utils.py
    import re

    def extract_html_content(text: str):
        match = re.search(r"(<html.*?>.*?</html>)", text, re.DOTALL) # Regex to find html tags
        if match:
            return match.group(1) # Returns the matched html content
        else:
            return text # Returns original text if no html tags found
    ```

    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Preparation**:
        - Set up and run the `screenshot-to-code` application locally or access a publicly hosted instance.
        - Prepare a malicious screenshot (e.g., `xss_screenshot.png`) that is designed to trigger the AI model to generate HTML with JavaScript alert. For example, the screenshot could visually represent a simple webpage with text, and the prompt to the AI could be to generate HTML+Tailwind.

    2. **Craft Malicious Screenshot Content Idea**:
        - The screenshot visually contains text like "Hello", but subtly includes a hidden or visually obscured string that might influence the AI model to include `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability')</script>` within the generated HTML.  Alternatively, the visual elements in the screenshot itself could be designed in a way that they are misinterpreted by the AI as code injection instructions. For simplicity, let's assume a direct visual representation that guides the AI.

    3. **Steps to Execute Test**:
        - Open the `screenshot-to-code` application in a web browser.
        - In the application, select "HTML + Tailwind" or any other stack.
        - Upload the prepared malicious screenshot `xss_screenshot.png`.
        - Click the "Generate Code" button.
        - Observe the generated code output in the application's preview area.

    4. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerability Confirmation)**:
        - If the application is vulnerable, a JavaScript alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" (or similar payload) should pop up in the browser when the generated code is rendered.
        - Inspect the generated code (if possible within the UI or by intercepting the WebSocket message). It should contain the injected JavaScript code, for example: `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability')</script>`.

    5. **Step-by-step Test Procedure**:
        1. Access the application in your browser (e.g., http://localhost:5173).
        2. Select "HTML + Tailwind" as the stack.
        3. Upload `xss_screenshot.png` as the input image.
        4. Click "Generate Code".
        5. Wait for the code generation process to complete.
        6. Check if an alert box appears in your browser displaying "XSS Vulnerability" (or your chosen payload message).
        7. If the alert box appears, the XSS vulnerability is confirmed.
        8. To further verify, inspect the HTML code received (e.g., using browser developer tools on the WebSocket communication if you can intercept it, or by examining the rendered output if the UI allows). Look for the injected `<script>` tag or similar malicious JavaScript code within the generated HTML.

This test case demonstrates a basic proof of concept for XSS in the AI-generated code. A real-world attacker would likely craft more sophisticated payloads for malicious purposes.
