### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code Rendering

- **Description:**
    - The backend of the application utilizes AI models to generate frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, etc.) from user-provided screenshots or video recordings.
    - This generated code is then transmitted to the frontend via a WebSocket connection.
    - The frontend, upon receiving this AI-generated code, renders it within the user's browser to display the converted design or prototype.
    - If an attacker can manipulate the input (screenshot or video) in such a way that the AI model inadvertently generates malicious JavaScript code within the output, and the frontend renders this output without proper sanitization, an XSS vulnerability is introduced.
    - An attacker could craft a malicious screenshot or video prompt that tricks the AI into producing JavaScript code designed to execute malicious actions.
    - When another user uses the application to generate code from this crafted input, the malicious JavaScript will be executed within their browser session.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser.
    - This can lead to a range of malicious activities, including:
        - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access to their account.
        - **Credential Theft:** Capturing user credentials (usernames, passwords) by injecting scripts that log keystrokes or redirect to phishing pages.
        - **Redirection to Malicious Websites:** Redirecting the user to attacker-controlled websites that may host malware or further exploit user data.
        - **Website Defacement:** Altering the visual appearance of the web page to mislead or cause reputational damage.
        - **Further System Compromise:** Potentially leveraging the XSS to launch further attacks against the user's system, depending on browser vulnerabilities and system configurations.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. Based on the provided source code, there is no evidence of input sanitization or output encoding implemented in the backend to prevent XSS. The backend code in `backend\routes\generate_code.py` focuses on calling AI models and streaming the generated code to the frontend. The function `extract_html_content` in `backend\codegen\utils.py` only extracts HTML and does not perform any sanitization.  Review of the files `backend\routes\evals.py`, `docker-compose.yml`, `backend\prompts\test_prompts.py`, `backend\config.py`, `backend\utils.py`, `backend\main.py`, `backend\run_image_generation_evals.py` confirms that no new mitigations have been implemented in the backend.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Backend Input Sanitization:** Implement sanitization of user inputs (screenshots, video prompts) to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious scripts before they are processed by the AI model. This is complex for image and video input, but text-based prompts could be sanitized.
    - **Frontend Output Sanitization:** Critically, the frontend must sanitize the AI-generated code before rendering it in the browser. This should involve using a robust HTML sanitization library to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious JavaScript or HTML elements.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources and restrict inline JavaScript execution. This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. **AI Output Manipulation:** An attacker must be able to craft an input (screenshot or video) that leads the AI model to generate code containing malicious JavaScript. This may require some degree of trial and error to identify effective prompts.
    2. **Vulnerable Frontend Rendering:** The frontend application must be vulnerable to rendering unsanitized HTML and JavaScript. Specifically, it must directly execute scripts included in the HTML received from the backend without proper sanitization.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`backend\routes\generate_code.py`:**
        - The `stream_code` WebSocket route in `backend\routes\generate_code.py` is responsible for handling code generation requests.
        - It receives user parameters, including the input image and desired stack.
        - It calls the `create_prompt` function in `backend\prompts\__init__.py` to assemble prompts for the AI model.
        - It then invokes either `stream_openai_response`, `stream_claude_response`, `stream_claude_response_native`, or `stream_gemini_response` from `backend\llm.py` to generate code using the selected AI model.
        - The generated code is streamed back to the frontend in chunks via WebSocket using `websocket.send_json({"type": "chunk", "value": content, "variantIndex": variantIndex})`.
        - After receiving the full code, the `extract_html_content` function from `backend\codegen\utils.py` is used to extract the HTML part of the response.
        - Finally, the extracted HTML code is sent to the frontend using `send_message("setCode", updated_html, index)`.
        - **Crucially, no sanitization or encoding is performed on the generated code before sending it to the frontend.**
        - Review of `backend\routes\evals.py` does not show any changes to this behavior.

    - **`backend\codegen\utils.py`:**
        - The `extract_html_content` function in `backend\codegen\utils.py` is used to parse the AI's response and extract the HTML code.
        - This function uses regular expressions to find content within `<html>` tags.
        - **This function only extracts content; it does not perform any form of sanitization or security processing that would prevent XSS.**
        - Review of `backend\utils.py` does not show any changes to this behavior.

    - **Frontend Code (Not Provided):**
        - **Assuming Vulnerable Rendering:**  For the purpose of identifying backend-introduced vulnerabilities, we must assume that the frontend directly renders the HTML code received from the backend, likely by setting the `innerHTML` of an element or using a similar method. This assumption is based on the project description indicating potential XSS risk if the frontend renders code unsafely. A secure frontend would use sanitization techniques before rendering.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Preparation:**
        - Access the publicly available instance of the screenshot-to-code application.
        - Prepare a malicious screenshot image. This image should be crafted to potentially induce the AI model to generate JavaScript code. For example, embed text within the image that, if interpreted as text by the AI and incorporated into the generated code, would represent a JavaScript injection. A simple example text embedded in the image could be: `<img src="invalid-url" onerror="alert('XSS-Test')">`.
        - Alternatively, construct a text prompt (if the application allows direct text prompts in addition to images) designed to elicit JavaScript code generation, such as: "Generate HTML for a button that, when clicked, executes `alert('XSS-Prompt')`".

    2. **Execution:**
        - In the application, upload the prepared malicious screenshot.
        - Select a frontend framework stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind, React + Tailwind).
        - Initiate the code generation process.
        - Once the code generation is complete, examine the rendered output in the application's frontend. Inspect the generated HTML code, typically within a preview pane or code editor provided by the application.

    3. **Verification:**
        - **Check for JavaScript Execution:** If the application is vulnerable, the JavaScript code injected via the screenshot (e.g., `alert('XSS-Test')`) will execute when the generated code is rendered. You should see an alert box pop up in your browser displaying "XSS-Test".
        - **Inspect Generated Code:** Examine the generated HTML source code. Look for the injected JavaScript code (e.g., `<img src="invalid-url" onerror="alert('XSS-Test')">`) within the output. If this script tag or event handler is present in the rendered code without being sanitized or encoded, it confirms the vulnerability.

    4. **Expected Result:**
        - If the application is vulnerable to XSS, the alert box with "XSS-Test" (or "XSS-Prompt") will appear in the browser, demonstrating successful execution of injected JavaScript code.
        - Inspection of the generated code will reveal the presence of the malicious JavaScript payload, confirming that the AI model output is rendered unsafely by the frontend.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can potentially leverage the AI code generation feature to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a user's browser, highlighting the Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability due to the lack of output sanitization.
