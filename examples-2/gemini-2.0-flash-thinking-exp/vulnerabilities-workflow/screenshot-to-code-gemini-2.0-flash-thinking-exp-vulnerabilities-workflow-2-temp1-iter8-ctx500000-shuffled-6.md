### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code
- Description:
  - Step 1: An attacker crafts a screenshot that includes malicious JavaScript code disguised as text within UI elements. For example, the screenshot could contain text like `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.
  - Step 2: A user, unknowingly or willingly, uploads this crafted screenshot to the application through the web interface.
  - Step 3: The backend receives the screenshot and sends it to the chosen AI model (e.g., Claude, GPT-4o) for code generation, based on the selected stack (e.g., React + Tailwind, HTML + CSS).
  - Step 4: The AI model processes the screenshot and, due to its nature of faithfully reproducing the visual elements, includes the malicious JavaScript payload from the screenshot directly into the generated code, without sanitization or encoding. For instance, the generated HTML might contain `<p><img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')></p>`.
  - Step 5: The backend sends this AI-generated code as a response to the frontend, typically via a WebSocket connection.
  - Step 6: The frontend receives the generated code and dynamically renders it within the user's browser, interpreting it as HTML and JavaScript.
  - Step 7: As the browser renders the malicious HTML content, the embedded JavaScript payload (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`) gets executed. In this example, the `onerror` event handler of the `<img>` tag triggers the execution of `alert('XSS')`, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability. This could be exploited to perform more harmful actions like stealing cookies or redirecting the user to a malicious site.
- Impact:
  - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser when they view the AI-generated code.
  - This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies, potentially leading to account takeover.
    - **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Redirecting users to attacker-controlled websites, possibly for phishing or malware distribution.
    - **Website Defacement:** Modifying the content of the web page viewed by the user.
    - **Information Theft:** Accessing sensitive information accessible within the browser context.
    - **Further Attacks:** Using the compromised context as a launching point for more sophisticated attacks against the user or the application.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - None. Review of the provided backend code (`codegen\utils.py`, `routes\generate_code.py`, `evals\core.py`, `llm.py`) and prompts (`prompts` directory) indicates no explicit sanitization or output encoding mechanisms are implemented to prevent XSS in the generated code. The focus is on functionality and visual fidelity rather than security hardening of the generated output.
- Missing mitigations:
  - **Output Sanitization/Encoding:** The most critical missing mitigation is the lack of any output sanitization or encoding of the AI-generated code before it's sent to the frontend. Specifically:
    - **HTML entities encoding:**  Encode HTML special characters (like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`) in text content extracted from the screenshot before embedding it in the generated HTML.
    - **JavaScript escaping:** If any part of the screenshot text is intended to be used within JavaScript code (though less likely in this image-to-code context, but still a good practice for general code generation), ensure proper JavaScript escaping to prevent injection.
  - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) would significantly reduce the impact of XSS vulnerabilities. A restrictive CSP can:
    - Disable inline JavaScript: Prevent the execution of inline scripts, forcing developers to use external JavaScript files, which are easier to manage and audit.
    - Restrict script sources: Define approved sources from which scripts can be loaded, mitigating the risk of loading malicious scripts from attacker-controlled domains.
    - Disable `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`: These CSP directives are crucial to prevent many common XSS attack vectors.
- Preconditions:
  - The attacker needs to be able to create a screenshot containing malicious JavaScript code disguised as normal text or UI elements.
  - The user must upload and process this crafted screenshot using the application.
- Source code analysis:
  - `backend\codegen\utils.py`:
    - The `extract_html_content(text: str)` function in `backend\codegen\utils.py` is used to extract HTML content from the AI's response.
    - ```python
      def extract_html_content(text: str):
          # Use regex to find content within <html> tags and include the tags themselves
          match = re.search(r"(<html.*?>.*?</html>)", text, re.DOTALL)
          if match:
              return match.group(1)
          else:
              # Otherwise, we just send the previous HTML over
              print(
                  "[HTML Extraction] No <html> tags found in the generated content: " + text
              )
              return text
      ```
    - **Analysis:** This function uses a regular expression to extract content within `<html>` tags. It does not perform any HTML sanitization or encoding. It simply extracts and returns the matched string. If the AI model generates code containing malicious scripts (due to a crafted screenshot), this function will extract and pass it along without modification.
  - `backend\routes\generate_code.py`:
    - The `stream_code` function in `backend\routes\generate_code.py` handles the code generation process:
    - It receives the screenshot and parameters from the frontend, calls the AI model, and streams the generated code back to the frontend via WebSocket.
    - It uses `extract_html_content` to process the AI's response.
    - ```python
      # Strip the completion of everything except the HTML content
      completions = [extract_html_content(completion) for completion in completions]
      ```
    - **Analysis:**  This code directly uses the output of `extract_html_content` without any further sanitization or security processing. The generated `completions` are directly sent to the frontend through the WebSocket:
    - ```python
      for index, updated_html in enumerate(updated_completions):
          await send_message("setCode", updated_html, index)
      ```
    - The `send_message` function then sends this HTML to the frontend:
    - ```python
      async def send_message(
          type: Literal["chunk", "status", "setCode", "error"],
          value: str,
          variantIndex: int,
      ):
          await websocket.send_json(
              {"type": type, "value": value, "variantIndex": variantIndex}
          )
      ```
    - **Visualization:**
      ```
      [Screenshot Upload] --> [Backend: routes\generate_code.py - stream_code]
                                  |
                                  V
                           [AI Model (Claude/GPT-4o)] --> [Generated Code (potentially malicious)]
                                  |
                                  V
                [backend\codegen\utils.py - extract_html_content] --> [Extracted HTML (malicious HTML is still present)]
                                  |
                                  V
                    [WebSocket Send to Frontend] --> [Frontend] --> [Browser renders malicious HTML] --> [XSS Triggered]
      ```
    - **Conclusion:** The source code analysis confirms that there is no mechanism to sanitize or encode the HTML code generated by the AI model before sending it to the frontend. This direct and unsanitized flow of AI-generated HTML creates a clear path for reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
- Security test case:
  - Step 1: Prepare a malicious screenshot image file (e.g., `xss_screenshot.png`). This screenshot should visually appear normal but contain text that includes a JavaScript payload. You can use an image editor to add text like `<img src="invalid-url" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')">` to the screenshot. Ensure the text is placed within a visually plausible UI element (like a button, label, or link) in the screenshot.
  - Step 2: Open the web application in a browser (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
  - Step 3: Use the application's interface to upload the `xss_screenshot.png` file. Select any stack (e.g., "HTML + Tailwind").
  - Step 4: Click the "Generate Code" button to initiate the code generation process.
  - Step 5: Once the code is generated and displayed in the application's output pane, examine the generated HTML code. You can typically do this by inspecting the element in your browser's developer tools. Look for the JavaScript payload you embedded in the screenshot (e.g., `<img src="invalid-url" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')">`) within the generated HTML structure.
  - Step 6: If the generated code contains the malicious payload and, upon rendering, you see an alert box pop up in your browser displaying "XSS Vulnerability!", it confirms that the reflected XSS vulnerability is present. The execution of `alert('XSS Vulnerability!')` demonstrates that arbitrary JavaScript code from the screenshot can be executed in the user's browser via the generated code.
