* Vulnerability name: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Screenshot Capture
* Description:
    1. An attacker sends a POST request to the `/api/screenshot` endpoint.
    2. In the request body, the attacker includes a malicious URL in the `url` parameter and a valid API key in the `apiKey` parameter.
    3. The backend application, specifically in the `app_screenshot` function in `backend/routes/screenshot.py`, receives the request.
    4. The application calls the `capture_screenshot` function, passing the attacker-controlled URL without proper validation.
    5. The `capture_screenshot` function makes an HTTP request to the `screenshotone.com/take` API, using the provided malicious URL as the `url` parameter in the API request.
    6. If `screenshotone.com` service processes the attacker-provided URL in a way that can lead to interaction with the backend's internal network or access to unintended external resources, an SSRF vulnerability is triggered. This could potentially allow the attacker to probe internal services, access sensitive information, or perform actions on internal resources depending on `screenshotone.com` behavior and backend network configuration.
* Impact: Allows an attacker to potentially probe internal network resources, access sensitive data, or interact with unintended external resources via the `screenshotone.com` service. The severity depends on the network configuration and the capabilities of the `screenshotone.com` API when processing arbitrary URLs.
* Vulnerability rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations: None. The code directly passes the user-provided URL to the external screenshot service without any validation.
* Missing mitigations: Implement robust input validation for the `url` parameter in the `/api/screenshot` endpoint. This should include:
    - Validating the URL scheme to only allow `http` and `https`.
    - Sanitizing the URL to prevent URL manipulation and injection attacks.
    - Potentially using a URL parsing library to verify the host and path are safe and expected.
    - Consider implementing a safelist of allowed domains or a denylist of disallowed domains, if applicable to the application's use case.
* Preconditions:
    - A publicly accessible instance of the `screenshot-to-code` application must be running.
    - The `/api/screenshot` endpoint must be exposed and reachable by external attackers.
* Source code analysis:
    ```python
    # File: ..\screenshot-to-code\backend\routes\screenshot.py
    @router.post("/api/screenshot")
    async def app_screenshot(request: ScreenshotRequest):
        # Extract the URL from the request body
        url = request.url # [!] User-provided URL is directly used
        api_key = request.apiKey

        # TODO: Add error handling
        image_bytes = await capture_screenshot(url, api_key=api_key) # [!] User-provided URL is passed to capture_screenshot function without validation

        # Convert the image bytes to a data url
        data_url = bytes_to_data_url(image_bytes, "image/png")

        return ScreenshotResponse(url=data_url)
    ```
    The `app_screenshot` function in `backend/routes/screenshot.py` takes the `url` from the `ScreenshotRequest` and directly passes it to the `capture_screenshot` function. No input validation or sanitization is performed on the URL before it is used to make a request to the external `screenshotone.com` API within the `capture_screenshot` function. This lack of validation allows an attacker to control the URL that the backend server requests, leading to a potential SSRF vulnerability.
* Security test case:
    1. Deploy the `screenshot-to-code` application to a publicly accessible server.
    2. Prepare a testing environment where you can monitor network requests made by the backend server, or prepare an internal service for testing.
    3. As an attacker, craft a POST request to the `/api/screenshot` endpoint of the deployed application.
    4. Set the `url` parameter in the JSON request body to point to an internal resource (e.g., `http://localhost:7001/api/home`) or an external service you control for monitoring (e.g., `http://attacker-controlled-domain.com/`). Include a valid API key in the `apiKey` parameter.
    5. Send the crafted POST request to the `/api/screenshot` endpoint.
    6. Analyze the network traffic or logs from your testing environment or controlled external service.
    7. If the backend server makes a request to the URL you provided (e.g., `http://localhost:7001/api/home` or `http://attacker-controlled-domain.com/`), and especially if you receive a response or information about the internal resource or external service, it confirms the SSRF vulnerability. For instance, if you target an internal endpoint, the response from `screenshotone.com` might contain error messages or content from that internal endpoint, or if you target an external controlled domain, you should see an incoming request in your server logs.

* Vulnerability name: Permissive CORS Policy
* Description:
    1. An attacker hosts a malicious website on a domain different from the `screenshot-to-code` backend.
    2. The attacker crafts JavaScript code within their malicious website to make cross-origin requests to the `screenshot-to-code` backend API endpoints (e.g., `/api/generate`, `/api/screenshot`).
    3. Due to the permissive CORS policy configured in `backend/main.py` (`allow_origins=["*"]`), the backend server responds with CORS headers that allow cross-origin requests from any domain, including the attacker's malicious website.
    4. The attacker's JavaScript code can successfully bypass the browser's Same-Origin Policy and make requests to the backend.
    5. Depending on the API endpoints accessed and the attacker's goals, this permissive CORS policy could enable various attacks. While in this specific case, it might not directly expose sensitive user data handled by the project itself (as it mainly interacts with external LLM APIs and user provided API keys), it weakens the application's security posture and could be a stepping stone for more complex attacks or expose backend functionality to unintended origins.
* Impact: Increases the attack surface of the backend application by allowing unauthorized cross-origin requests from any website. While the direct impact might be limited in this specific project context, it deviates from security best practices and could be more critical in applications handling sensitive user data or business logic.
* Vulnerability rank: high (as per instructions), medium (realistically)
* Currently implemented mitigations: CORS is enabled using `fastapi.middleware.cors.CORSMiddleware`, but it is configured with `allow_origins=["*"]`, which is overly permissive and effectively disables CORS protection.
* Missing mitigations: Configure a restrictive CORS policy by setting `allow_origins` to a list of specific, trusted origins instead of `"*"` wildcard. For a publicly hosted application, identify the legitimate frontend origin (e.g., `https://screenshottocode.com`) and allow only that origin, along with `http://localhost:5173` for local development if needed. Remove wildcard and specify origins explicitly.
* Preconditions:
    - A publicly accessible instance of the `screenshot-to-code` backend application must be running with CORS enabled.
    - The backend must be reachable over the network.
* Source code analysis:
    ```python
    # File: ..\screenshot-to-code\backend\main.py
    from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

    app = FastAPI(openapi_url=None, docs_url=None, redoc_url=None)

    # Configure CORS settings
    app.add_middleware(
        CORSMiddleware,
        allow_origins=["*"], # [!] Permissive CORS policy allowing all origins
        allow_credentials=True,
        allow_methods=["*"],
        allow_headers=["*"],
    )
    ```
    The `backend/main.py` file configures CORS middleware with `allow_origins=["*"]`. This wildcard setting in `allow_origins` effectively permits cross-origin requests from any domain, defeating the security purpose of CORS.
* Security test case:
    1. Deploy the `screenshot-to-code` application to a publicly accessible server.
    2. Create a malicious HTML file and host it on a different domain (e.g., `http://malicious-domain.com`).
    3. In the malicious HTML file, include JavaScript code that attempts to make a cross-origin request to the deployed `screenshot-to-code` backend, for example, to fetch data from `/api/models` or trigger code generation via `/api/generate`. Example JavaScript snippet:
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Malicious Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script>
            fetch('http://<your-screenshot-to-code-backend-domain>/api/models') // Replace with your backend domain
                .then(response => response.json())
                .then(data => {
                    alert('CORS is permissive! Data: ' + JSON.stringify(data));
                })
                .catch(error => {
                    alert('CORS might be restrictive or error: ' + error);
                });
        </script>
        <h1>Malicious Website</h1>
        <p>Trying to access screenshot-to-code backend...</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    4. Open the malicious HTML file in a web browser by navigating to `http://malicious-domain.com/malicious.html`.
    5. If an alert box appears showing the JSON response from `/api/models`, it confirms that the permissive CORS policy allows cross-origin requests from the malicious domain. If the request is blocked by the browser due to CORS, no alert or an error alert will be shown. Successful retrieval of data indicates permissive CORS.
