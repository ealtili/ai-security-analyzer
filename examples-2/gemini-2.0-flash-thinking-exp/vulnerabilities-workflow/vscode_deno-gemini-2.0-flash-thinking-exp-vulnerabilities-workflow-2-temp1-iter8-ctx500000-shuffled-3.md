### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Deno Upgrade via Malicious `latestVersion`

- Description:
    1. The VSCode Deno extension prompts users to upgrade Deno when a new version is available.
    2. The extension uses the `deno upgrade` command to perform the upgrade.
    3. The target version for the upgrade (`latestVersion`) is obtained from the Deno Language Server in a `deno/didUpgradeCheck` notification.
    4. If the Deno Language Server is compromised or manipulated to return a maliciously crafted `latestVersion` string, this string is directly used as an argument to the `deno upgrade --version` command.
    5. By crafting a `latestVersion` string containing shell command injection payloads, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the user's system when the user attempts to upgrade Deno through the extension.

- Impact:
    Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the user running VSCode. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None in the provided code. The `upgrade.ts` code directly uses the `latestVersion` string received from the Language Server to construct the `deno upgrade` command without any sanitization or validation.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization: The `latestVersion` string received from the Deno Language Server should be strictly validated to ensure it only contains a valid semantic version string and does not include any shell metacharacters or command separators.
    - Command construction: Instead of directly embedding the `latestVersion` string into the command arguments, use a safer method of passing the version as an argument to the Deno CLI, ensuring it is treated as a single version string and not interpreted as shell commands.

- Preconditions:
    1. The user must have the VSCode Deno extension installed and enabled.
    2. The Deno Language Server must be configured to communicate with the VSCode extension.
    3. An attacker must be able to compromise or manipulate the Deno Language Server to send a malicious `deno/didUpgradeCheck` notification with a crafted `latestVersion`.
    4. The user must be prompted to upgrade Deno by the extension and must choose to proceed with the upgrade.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `client/src/upgrade.ts`
    - Function: `denoUpgradePromptAndExecute`

    ```typescript
    // ...
    export async function denoUpgradePromptAndExecute(
      { latestVersion, isCanary }: UpgradeAvailable,
    ) {
      // ...
      args.push("--version");
      args.push(latestVersion); // [!] Vulnerable line: latestVersion is directly used as command argument
      // ...
      const definition: tasks.DenoTaskDefinition = {
        type: tasks.TASK_TYPE,
        command: "upgrade",
        args, // [!] args array contains unsanitized latestVersion
        env,
      };
      // ...
      const task = tasks.buildDenoTask(
        workspaceFolder,
        denoCommand,
        definition,
        "upgrade",
        args, // [!] args array is passed to task execution
        ["$deno"],
      );
      // ...
      await vscode.tasks.executeTask(task); // [!] Task is executed, potentially with command injection
      // ...
    }
    ```

    ```

    **Step-by-step vulnerability breakdown:**
    1. A compromised or malicious Deno Language Server sends a `deno/didUpgradeCheck` notification to the VSCode Deno extension. This notification includes a `latestVersion` field that is crafted to contain a command injection payload, for example: `"1.23.4 && malicious_command"`.
    2. The `denoUpgradePromptAndExecute` function in `client/src/upgrade.ts` receives this notification and extracts the malicious `latestVersion`.
    3. The function then constructs an array of arguments (`args`) for the `deno upgrade` command. Crucially, the malicious `latestVersion` is added to this `args` array without any sanitization: `args.push(latestVersion);`.
    4. A `DenoTaskDefinition` is created with the command set to "upgrade" and the `args` array containing the malicious payload.
    5. A `vscode.Task` is built using this `DenoTaskDefinition`, which essentially encapsulates the `deno upgrade` command with the injected payload.
    6. `vscode.tasks.executeTask(task)` is called, which executes the constructed task in the system shell. Due to the command injection in `latestVersion`, the shell executes both the intended `deno upgrade` command and the attacker's malicious command.
    7. Arbitrary code execution occurs on the user's system, as the shell interprets and executes the injected commands.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Set up a mock Deno Language Server or intercept communication from a real Deno LSP.
        - Configure the mock server to send a `deno/didUpgradeCheck` notification with a malicious `latestVersion`. For example, set `latestVersion` to `"1.23.4 && echo 'Vulnerable' > /tmp/vuln.txt"`. For Windows, use `"1.23.4 & echo Vulnerable > C:\vuln.txt"`.
    2. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Open VSCode with the Deno extension activated and connected to the mock LSP.
        - Wait for the extension to receive the `deno/didUpgradeCheck` notification and prompt the user to upgrade Deno.
        - Click "Upgrade" in the prompt.
    3. **Verify Impact:**
        - Check for the execution of the injected command. In this example, verify that the file `/tmp/vuln.txt` (or `C:\vuln.txt` on Windows) has been created and contains the text "Vulnerable".
        - Observe if any other unexpected system behavior occurs as a result of the injected command.
    4. **Expected Result:**
        - The file `/tmp/vuln.txt` (or `C:\vuln.txt`) should be created, indicating successful command injection and arbitrary code execution.
        - No errors should be reported by VSCode or the Deno extension itself, as the vulnerability is in how the upgrade command is constructed and executed, not in the extension's error handling.

This test case demonstrates that a maliciously crafted `latestVersion` from the Deno Language Server can indeed lead to command injection and arbitrary code execution when the user initiates a Deno upgrade through the VSCode extension.
