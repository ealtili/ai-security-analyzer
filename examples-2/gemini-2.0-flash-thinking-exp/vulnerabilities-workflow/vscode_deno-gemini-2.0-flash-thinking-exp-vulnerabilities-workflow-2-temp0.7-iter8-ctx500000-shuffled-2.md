### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Path Traversal via `deno.config` and `deno.importMap` settings

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Visual Studio Code workspace.
    2. The attacker creates a `settings.json` file within the `.vscode` folder of the malicious workspace.
    3. In the `settings.json`, the attacker sets either the `deno.config` or `deno.importMap` setting to an absolute file path pointing outside the intended workspace directory. For example, on Linux, this could be set to `/etc/passwd`, or on Windows, to `C:\Windows\win.ini`.
    4. The victim user opens this malicious workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension installed and enabled (either globally or for the workspace).
    5. When the Deno extension initializes or performs operations that utilize these configuration settings (like starting the language server, caching dependencies, linting, formatting, or running tests), it passes the attacker-controlled file path directly to the Deno CLI as a command-line argument (e.g., using `--config` or `--import-map`).
    6. The Deno CLI, executed by the extension, attempts to access and process the file specified by the attacker-controlled path, potentially leading to reading files outside the intended workspace scope.

- **Impact:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** A successful path traversal can allow an attacker to read sensitive files from the victim's file system that the Deno process has permissions to access. This could include configuration files, application secrets, or other sensitive data depending on the system's file permissions and the location of the traversed path.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The extension directly passes the configured paths to the Deno CLI without validation or sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Path Validation:** The extension should validate the paths provided in the `deno.config` and `deno.importMap` settings. It should ensure that these paths are within the workspace directory or within a set of explicitly allowed directories.
    - **Path Sanitization:**  Before passing the paths to the Deno CLI, the extension should sanitize them to prevent any path traversal attempts. This could involve resolving paths to their canonical form and verifying they remain within the allowed boundaries.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The victim user must have the `vscode-deno` extension installed and enabled.
    - The victim user must open a malicious workspace provided by the attacker.
    - The malicious workspace must contain a `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets either `deno.config` or `deno.importMap` to a path outside the workspace.
    - The `deno.enable` setting must be set to `true` for the workspace or globally.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`client\src\debug_config_provider.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        #getAdditionalRuntimeArgs() {
            const args: string[] = [];
            const settings = this.#extensionContext.clientOptions
              .initializationOptions();
            // ...
            if (settings.importMap) {
              args.push("--import-map");
              args.push(settings.importMap.trim()); // Attacker-controlled path from settings.json
            }
            if (settings.config) {
              args.push("--config");
              args.push(settings.config.trim()); // Attacker-controlled path from settings.json
            }
            return args;
          }
        ```
        This code snippet from `DenoDebugConfigurationProvider` shows how `deno.config` and `deno.importMap` settings are retrieved from the extension's configuration and directly appended as arguments to the Deno CLI command when creating debug configurations. There is no validation of these paths before they are used in the command execution.

    - **`client\src\commands.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        export function startLanguageServer(
          context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
          extensionContext: DenoExtensionContext,
        ): Callback {
          return async () => {
            // ...
            const config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS);
            // ...
            const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
              run: {
                command,
                args: ["lsp"],
                options: { env },
              },
              debug: {
                command,
                args: ["lsp"],
                options: { env },
              },
            };
            const client = new LanguageClient(
              LANGUAGE_CLIENT_ID,
              LANGUAGE_CLIENT_NAME,
              serverOptions,
              {
                // ...
                initializationOptions: () => {
                  const denoConfiguration = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get(
                    EXTENSION_NS,
                  ) as Record<string, unknown>;
                  transformDenoConfiguration(extensionContext, denoConfiguration);
                  return {
                    ...denoConfiguration, // Contains deno.config and deno.importMap from settings.json
                    javascript: vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get("javascript"),
                    typescript: vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get("typescript"),
                    enableBuiltinCommands: true,
                  } as object;
                },
                // ...
              },
            );
            // ...
          }
        ```
        In `startLanguageServer`, the `initializationOptions` function includes the entire `denoConfiguration` from VS Code settings, which includes `deno.config` and `deno.importMap`. These settings are then used by the Deno language server, potentially leading to path traversal when the server processes these configurations.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Ensure you have the `vscode-deno` extension installed and enabled.
        - Create a new empty folder named `malicious-workspace`.
        - Inside `malicious-workspace`, create a folder named `.vscode`.
        - Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json`.
        - Create a file named `test.ts` in the `malicious-workspace` root.

    2. **Craft Malicious Settings:**
        - Open `malicious-workspace/.vscode/settings.json` and add the following configuration (adjust the path for your operating system):
            ```json
            {
                "deno.enable": true,
                "deno.config": "/etc/passwd" // For Linux/macOS, or "C:\\Windows\\win.ini" for Windows
            }
            ```
            or
            ```json
            {
                "deno.enable": true,
                "deno.importMap": "/etc/passwd" // For Linux/macOS, or "C:\\Windows\\win.ini" for Windows
            }
            ```
        - Save `settings.json`.

    3. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Open the `malicious-workspace` folder in Visual Studio Code.
        - Open the `test.ts` file. This action should trigger the Deno language server to start and process the configuration, including the malicious `deno.config` or `deno.importMap` path.

    4. **Observe (Indirectly):**
        - **Observe for Errors:** Check the "Deno Language Server" output channel for any error messages related to accessing the configured path (e.g., "permission denied", "file not found" if the target file is intentionally non-readable or non-existent for testing purposes). This would indirectly indicate that the Deno CLI is indeed attempting to access the file specified in `deno.config` or `deno.importMap`.
        - **File System Monitoring (Advanced):** For a more definitive test, use system file monitoring tools (like `lsof` on Linux/macOS or Process Monitor on Windows) to observe if the `deno` process attempts to access the file specified in the malicious `deno.config` or `deno.importMap` path when the workspace is opened and the extension activates.

    5. **Expected Outcome:**
        - You should observe error messages in the "Deno Language Server" output channel, or file system access attempts in monitoring tools, indicating that the Deno CLI is trying to read the file specified in the malicious configuration. This confirms the path traversal vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to potentially read arbitrary files on the system if the Deno process has sufficient permissions, simply by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted workspace in VS Code with the Deno extension enabled.
