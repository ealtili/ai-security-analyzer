- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Deno Executable Path Configuration
- Description:
    1. An attacker tricks a user into modifying the VS Code workspace settings for the Deno extension.
    2. The attacker convinces the user to change the `deno.path` configuration setting to point to a malicious executable file instead of the legitimate Deno CLI executable.
    3. The user saves the workspace settings.
    4. The VS Code Deno extension, upon activation or when triggered by certain actions (like opening a Deno project file, running a command that requires Deno CLI, or extension restart due to configuration change), reads the `deno.path` setting.
    5. Instead of executing the real Deno CLI, the extension executes the malicious executable specified in the `deno.path` setting.
    6. The malicious executable performs actions as defined by the attacker, effectively achieving arbitrary code execution within the user's environment with the privileges of the VS Code process.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
    - Potential data exfiltration, malware installation, or system compromise depending on the attacker's malicious executable.
    - Full control over the user's environment within the sandbox of the VS Code process.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the code to prevent execution of a malicious path if configured.
    - Documentation in `README.md` warns users about the `deno.path` setting, but this is not a sufficient mitigation against determined attackers or social engineering.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation for the `deno.path` setting:
        - Check if the provided path is an executable file.
        - Validate if the path is within expected locations for Deno installations (e.g., standard installation directories, or PATH environment variables).
        - Warn the user if the `deno.path` is set to a non-standard or suspicious location.
    - Display a prominent warning in VS Code when the `deno.path` setting is explicitly configured and points to a location outside of typical Deno installation paths, especially if it's a user-writable directory.
- Preconditions:
    - The "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension must be installed and activated in VS Code.
    - The user must have the ability to modify workspace settings in VS Code.
    - The attacker needs to successfully socially engineer or trick the user into changing the `deno.path` setting to a malicious executable.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `client\src\util.ts`
        - Function: `getDenoCommandPath()`
        - Step 1: Retrieves the value of the `deno.path` setting using `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`.
        - Step 2: If `deno.path` is configured, it checks if the path is absolute.
        - Step 3: If the path is relative, it attempts to resolve it against workspace folders.
        - Step 4: If `deno.path` is not set or not resolved within workspace folders, it falls back to `getDefaultDenoCommand()`.
        - Step 5: Returns the resolved path without any validation to ensure it's a legitimate Deno executable or to prevent malicious paths.
    - File: `client\src\commands.ts`
        - Function: `startLanguageServer()`
        - Step 1: Calls `getDenoCommandPath()` to obtain the path of the Deno executable.
        - Step 2: Uses the returned path directly as the `command` in `ServerOptions` for both `run` and `debug` configurations of the LanguageClient.
        - Step 3: The `LanguageClient` then uses this unvalidated path to spawn a child process, which will execute whatever executable is at that path.
    - Visualization:
        ```
        [VS Code Settings (deno.path)] --> getDenoCommandPath() --> startLanguageServer() --> LanguageClient.start() --> child_process.spawn(denoPath) --> [Malicious Executable (if denoPath is manipulated)]
        ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup:
        - Create a directory, e.g., `malicious_deno_dir`.
        - Inside `malicious_deno_dir`, create a file named `deno.sh` (or `deno.bat` on Windows) with the following content:
            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "Malicious Deno Executable is running!" >> /tmp/malicious_deno_execution.log
            # (Windows batch script equivalent for creating log file in %TEMP%)
            ```
            (Ensure the script is executable: `chmod +x malicious_deno_dir/deno.sh`)
        - Open VS Code. Create or open any folder as a workspace.
    2. Configuration Manipulation:
        - Open Workspace Settings (`.vscode/settings.json`).
        - Add or modify the `deno.path` setting to point to the malicious script:
            ```json
            {
                "deno.path": "/path/to/malicious_deno_dir/deno.sh" // Replace with the actual path
            }
            ```
    3. Trigger Extension Action:
        - Open a TypeScript or JavaScript file within the workspace. This should trigger the Deno extension to start the language server. Alternatively, you can execute any Deno command from the command palette (e.g., "Deno: Language Server Status").
    4. Verify Exploitation:
        - Check if the file `/tmp/malicious_deno_execution.log` (or the Windows equivalent %TEMP% log file) has been created and contains the message "Malicious Deno Executable is running!".
        - If the log file exists with the message, it confirms that the malicious executable specified in `deno.path` was executed by the VS Code Deno extension instead of the legitimate Deno CLI, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.
