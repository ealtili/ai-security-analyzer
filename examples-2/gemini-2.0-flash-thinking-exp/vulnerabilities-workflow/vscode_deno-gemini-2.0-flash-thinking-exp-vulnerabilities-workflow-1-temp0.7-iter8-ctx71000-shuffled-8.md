### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Command Injection in 'Deno: Test' Command via Malicious File Path

*   **Description:**
    1.  A threat actor creates a malicious repository containing a JavaScript or TypeScript file with a specially crafted filename.
    2.  The victim clones this malicious repository and opens it in VSCode with the Deno extension enabled.
    3.  The threat actor lures the victim to open the malicious file in the editor, which contains a `Deno.test()` declaration, triggering the display of the "Run Test" code lens.
    4.  The victim clicks the "Run Test" code lens above the `Deno.test()` declaration in the malicious file.
    5.  The Deno extension executes the `deno test` command, constructing the command arguments by including the `filePath` derived from the malicious file's URI without proper sanitization.
    6.  Due to the malicious filename containing command injection payloads, arbitrary commands are executed on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.

*   **Impact:**
    Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or complete system compromise.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** critical

*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    None. The code directly uses the `filePath` derived from the file URI in the command execution without any sanitization or validation.

*   **Missing mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization: The `filePath` should be sanitized to remove or escape any characters that could be interpreted as shell metacharacters before being used in command construction.
    - Command arguments construction: Use secure methods for constructing command arguments, such as passing arguments as separate parameters to the `child_process.spawn` function instead of concatenating them into a single string.

*   **Preconditions:**
    1.  The victim has the VSCode Deno extension installed and enabled.
    2.  The victim clones and opens a malicious repository in VSCode.
    3.  The malicious repository contains a JavaScript or TypeScript file with a crafted filename and a `Deno.test()` declaration.
    4.  The victim opens the malicious file in VSCode editor and clicks the "Run Test" code lens.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**

    1.  **File:** `client/src/commands.ts`
    2.  **Function:** `test`
    3.  **Code Snippet:**
        ```typescript
        export function test(
          _context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
          extensionContext: DenoExtensionContext,
        ): Callback {
          return async (uriStr: string, name: string, options: TestCommandOptions) => {
            const uri = vscode.Uri.parse(uriStr, true);
            const filePath = uri.fsPath;
            // ... other configurations ...
            const nameRegex = `/^${name.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, "\\$&")}$/`;
            const args = ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", nameRegex, filePath];
            // ... task execution ...
          };
        ```
    4.  **Vulnerability Point:** The `filePath` variable, derived from `uriStr` using `uri.fsPath`, is directly appended to the `args` array used to construct the `deno test` command. There is no input sanitization on `filePath` before it is used in the command execution.
    5.  **Code Flow:**
        - The `test` command handler is triggered when the "Run Test" code lens is clicked.
        - `uriStr` is the URI of the currently opened file, provided by VSCode based on the file clicked on.
        - `vscode.Uri.parse(uriStr, true).fsPath` extracts the file system path from the URI.
        - `filePath` is then directly used as the last argument in the `args` array for the `deno test` command.
        - The `buildDenoTask` and subsequent functions will execute the command constructed with these arguments using `child_process.spawn` or similar mechanisms.
    6.  **Visualization:**

        ```
        [User clicks "Run Test" code lens]
            --> commands.test(uriStr, name, options)
                --> uri = vscode.Uri.parse(uriStr, true)
                --> filePath = uri.fsPath  // filePath from potentially malicious filename
                --> args = ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", nameRegex, filePath] // filePath unsanitized in args
                --> buildDenoTask(..., args, ...) // Command executed with unsanitized filePath
        ```

*   **Security Test Case:**

    1.  Create a malicious repository.
    2.  Create a file with a malicious filename, for example: `test`;touch poc.txt;`.ts (Note: filenames may vary based on OS limitations - for windows try `test&calc&.ts` or similar).
    3.  Add the following content to the malicious file:
        ```typescript
        Deno.test("Vulnerable Test", () => {
          console.log("Test running");
        });
        ```
    4.  Clone the malicious repository to your local machine.
    5.  Open the cloned repository in VSCode with the Deno extension enabled.
    6.  Open the malicious file (`test`;touch poc.txt;`.ts`) in the VSCode editor.
    7.  Observe the "Run Test" code lens appearing above the `Deno.test()` declaration.
    8.  Click the "Run Test" code lens.
    9.  Check if the command `touch poc.txt` (or `calc` on Windows) was executed. Verify by checking for the existence of `poc.txt` file in the repository directory or the calculator application launching on Windows.
    10. If `poc.txt` is created or calculator is launched, the vulnerability is confirmed.
