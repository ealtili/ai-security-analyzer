- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Component Rendering via User-Controlled Input

- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts malicious JavaScript code.
  2. The attacker inputs this malicious code into a user-controlled input field within a Django Unicorn component. This input field is bound to a component property using `unicorn:model`.
  3. The user triggers an event (e.g., `blur`, `click` if bound to an action, or `input` by default) that sends the updated component data to the server.
  4. The Django Unicorn backend updates the component's property with the user-provided malicious code.
  5. The component is re-rendered, and the template is rendered with the updated property, including the malicious JavaScript code.
  6. The rendered HTML containing the unsanitized malicious JavaScript is sent back to the client.
  7. The client-side JavaScript in django-unicorn updates the DOM with the received HTML.
  8. The browser executes the injected malicious JavaScript code, leading to XSS.

- Impact:
  - Account Takeover: An attacker can potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to account takeover.
  - Data Theft: Malicious scripts can be used to extract data from the user's session or the web page itself and send it to a third-party server controlled by the attacker.
  - Website Defacement: The attacker could alter the visual appearance of the web page, potentially damaging the website's reputation.
  - Redirection to Malicious Sites: Users could be redirected to malicious websites, potentially leading to further exploitation or malware infections.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - Django's template engine provides auto-escaping of HTML by default, which should mitigate many XSS vulnerabilities. However, the documentation does not explicitly state that all user inputs handled by Unicorn components are automatically sanitized server-side beyond Django form validation.
  - The documentation highlights "Form Validation" using Django forms, which, if implemented correctly and consistently, can sanitize inputs before they are rendered. However, reliance on developers to always implement and use forms correctly might not be a complete mitigation.
  - Changelog v0.36.0 mentions "Security fix: for CVE-2021-42053 to prevent XSS attacks" and states "responses will be HTML encoded going forward". This suggests a previous vulnerability and indicates some mitigation is now in place via HTML encoding. Changelog v0.36.1 also mentions "More complete handling to prevent XSS attacks." and "More verbose error messages when components can't be loaded". This indicates ongoing efforts to mitigate XSS.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Explicit server-side sanitization of all user inputs before rendering within components, beyond relying solely on Django's template auto-escaping and optional form validation.
  - Clear and prominent documentation emphasizing the importance of sanitizing user inputs within Django Unicorn components to prevent XSS.
  - Security focused testing and examples demonstrating how to properly handle user input and prevent XSS.
  -  Consider Content Security Policy (CSP) as a defense-in-depth mechanism to further limit the impact of XSS, although this is typically application-level configuration and not library-level.

- Preconditions:
  - A Django Unicorn component must be rendering user-controlled input directly in the HTML template without explicit sanitization (beyond Django's default template auto-escaping, and assuming form validation might not be consistently applied to *all* user inputs).
  - An attacker needs to be able to input text into a `unicorn:model` bound input field.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - Based on the documentation files, particularly `templates.md` and `actions.md`, the `django-unicorn` framework binds user inputs from the template to component properties.
  - `templates.md` shows examples of using `unicorn:model` directly in input fields, e.g., `<input unicorn:model="name" type="text" id="text" />`.
  - `actions.md` demonstrates how actions can set properties directly using `unicorn:click="name='Bob'"` and pass arguments from the template to backend methods via actions, e.g.,  `<button unicorn:click="set('Bob')">Set as Bob</button>`.
  - If a developer uses `unicorn:model` to directly render user input in the template, such as `Hello {{ name|title }}`, and if the component's Python code does not sanitize the `name` property (relying only on default Django template escaping), it could be vulnerable to XSS if the input in the `name` field contains malicious JavaScript.
  - The changelog mentions fixes for XSS (v0.36.0 and v0.36.1), which suggests that previous versions might have been vulnerable and that current versions aim to encode HTML responses. However, without examining the specific code changes in those versions and the current code, it's hard to definitively assess the effectiveness of these mitigations and if there are still bypasses or missed scenarios.
  - **Visualization:** (Conceptual Data Flow)
    ```
    User Input (Malicious JS) -> HTML Input Field (unicorn:model="name") -> Browser Event -> AJAX Request (User Input in Payload) -> Django Unicorn Backend -> Component Property "name" <= User Input (No Explicit Sanitization in Example Code) -> Component Re-rendering -> HTML Template Rendering (e.g., `{{ name }}`) -> Unsanitized HTML Response (Malicious JS in HTML) -> Browser DOM Update -> XSS Execution
    ```

- Security Test Case:
  1. Deploy a Django application with django-unicorn integrated and a vulnerable component. The vulnerable component should:
    - Have a template with an input field bound to a component property using `unicorn:model`, e.g., `<input type="text" unicorn:model="xss_input">` and display this property in the template, e.g., `<div id="output">{{ xss_input }}</div>`.
    - The component's Python code should NOT explicitly sanitize the `xss_input` property before rendering. A simple component like this could be created:
      ```python
      from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

      class XssTestView(UnicornView):
          xss_input = ""
      ```
      and template:
      ```html
      <div>
        <input type="text" unicorn:model="xss_input" id="xss_input">
        <div id="output">{{ xss_input }}</div>
      </div>
      ```
  2. As an attacker, access the deployed application through a web browser.
  3. Locate the vulnerable Django Unicorn component.
  4. In the input field (`id="xss_input"`), enter the following payload: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`
  5. Trigger an event that sends the input to the server, e.g., click away from the input field (blur event), or trigger an action button if available.
  6. Observe the output in the `#output` div.
  7. **Expected Result:** An alert box with "XSS" should appear, demonstrating that the JavaScript code was executed. If the alert box appears, the vulnerability is confirmed. If the raw HTML payload is rendered (e.g., `&lt;img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')&gt;`), then the default Django auto-escaping is working, and this specific simple test case might not be vulnerable, but more complex bypasses might still exist. Further testing with more complex XSS payloads and different contexts (actions, arguments, JavaScript integration points) would be needed to fully assess the XSS risk.

- Vulnerability Rank Justification: High rank is assigned due to the potential for significant impact (account takeover, data theft, website defacement) if exploited. XSS vulnerabilities are generally considered high severity, especially in widely used web frameworks. Even with auto-escaping in Django templates, the risk exists if developers are not fully aware of the context-specific escaping requirements or if there are bypass scenarios or vulnerabilities in the framework itself. The documentation provided does not sufficiently emphasize XSS prevention beyond form validation, which increases the likelihood of developers introducing this vulnerability.
