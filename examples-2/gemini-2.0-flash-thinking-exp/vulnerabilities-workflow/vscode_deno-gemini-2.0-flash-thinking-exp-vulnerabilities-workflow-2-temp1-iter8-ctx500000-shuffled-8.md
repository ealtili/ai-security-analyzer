- Vulnerability Name: Import Map Redirection to Malicious Code Execution

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious `import_map.json` file. This file contains mappings that redirect module specifiers, typically pointing to legitimate remote modules, to locations controlled by the attacker. These attacker-controlled locations can host malicious code.
    2. The attacker creates a Visual Studio Code workspace.
    3. The attacker places the malicious `import_map.json` at the root of this workspace or at a path that will be configured as `deno.importMap` in the workspace settings.
    4. The attacker then entices a victim user to open this workspace in Visual Studio Code with the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension active and enabled for the workspace.
    5. When the workspace is opened and the Deno extension initializes (or when a Deno file in the workspace is opened), the extension reads the `deno.importMap` setting and utilizes the specified `import_map.json` for Deno's module resolution process within the VS Code environment.
    6. As the extension attempts to resolve module imports (e.g., during type checking, code completion, or other language server features), it consults the malicious import map.
    7. Due to the mappings in the `import_map.json`, import specifiers are redirected to attacker-controlled locations instead of the intended legitimate sources.
    8. When Deno attempts to load modules based on these redirected specifiers, it inadvertently executes the malicious code hosted at the attacker-controlled locations, leading to potential Remote Code Execution within the user's VS Code environment and potentially the user's system depending on the nature of the malicious code and the permissions granted to Deno.

- Impact:
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This can lead to:
        - Data theft: Access to sensitive information within the workspace and potentially beyond.
        - System compromise: Installation of malware, backdoors, or further exploitation of the user's system.
        - Workspace manipulation: Modification or deletion of project files.
        - Credential harvesting: Theft of credentials stored or used within the VS Code environment.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided project files specifically address the risk of malicious import maps. The extension relies on the Deno CLI's import map functionality without adding specific security measures against malicious maps.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for `import_map.json` content to detect and prevent potentially harmful mappings.
    - User warnings when an import map is configured, especially if it is not located within the workspace or if it redirects to external or potentially untrusted locations.
    - Sandboxing or isolation mechanisms to limit the impact of executed code from redirected modules, even if malicious.
    - Trust mechanism for import maps, allowing users to specify trusted sources for import maps and warn or prevent usage of untrusted ones.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension installed and enabled.
    - The user must open a Visual Studio Code workspace provided by an attacker that contains a malicious `import_map.json` file.
    - The `deno.enable` setting must be true for the workspace or the relevant folders within the workspace.
    - The `deno.importMap` setting must be either implicitly active by the presence of `import_map.json` in the workspace root or explicitly set to point to the malicious `import_map.json`.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided code does not show explicit handling or validation of the content of `import_map.json`.
    - The `deno.importMap` setting is mentioned in `README.md` and `client\src\extension.ts` as part of the configuration that is passed to the Deno Language Server.
    - The extension's code focuses on passing configuration to the Deno Language Server and disabling built-in TypeScript features when Deno is enabled.
    - The vulnerability lies in the Deno Language Server's module resolution logic and how it trusts and uses the provided `import_map.json` without sufficient security checks.
    - The file `client\src\extension.ts` initializes the language client with configurations from VS Code settings, including `deno.importMap` in `initializationOptions`.
    - The `typescript-deno-plugin` (`typescript-deno-plugin\src\index.ts`) receives plugin settings but doesn't seem to be directly involved in handling `import_map.json` or module resolution security. Its role is mainly to disable TypeScript language service features based on Deno settings.
    - The code in `client\src\enable.ts` and `client\src\shared_types.d.ts` deals with enabling/disabling Deno for workspaces and folders based on settings like `deno.enable`, `deno.enablePaths`, and `deno.disablePaths`. This is related to the scope of Deno's operation but not directly to the `import_map.json` vulnerability itself.
    - The vulnerability stems from the design of Deno's module resolution and the extension's configuration mechanism, where a user-provided `import_map.json`, even if malicious, is trusted and used without validation or user warnings.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Files:**
        - Create a file named `malicious.js` with the following content in an empty directory:
          ```javascript
          console.log("Malicious code executed from redirected module!");
          // Simulate malicious action, e.g., creating a file in the workspace
          const fs = require('fs');
          fs.writeFileSync('pwned.txt', 'You have been PWNED by malicious import map!');
          ```
        - Create a file named `import_map.json` in the same directory with the following content:
          ```json
          {
            "imports": {
              "std/fs/mod.ts": "./malicious.js"
            }
          }
          ```
        - Create a file named `test.ts` in the same directory with the following content:
          ```typescript
          import * as fs from "std/fs/mod.ts";

          console.log("Test file executed.");
          ```

    2. **Create VS Code Workspace:**
        - Open Visual Studio Code.
        - Open the empty directory where you created the above files as a workspace (`File` -> `Open Folder...`).
        - Ensure the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension is enabled for this workspace (you might need to run "Deno: Enable" command in the command palette).

    3. **Set `deno.importMap` Setting:**
        - Open VS Code settings (`File` -> `Preferences` -> `Settings` or `Code` -> `Settings` -> `Settings` on macOS).
        - Go to Workspace settings.
        - Search for `deno.importMap`.
        - If not already set, add `"deno.importMap": "./import_map.json"` to your workspace `settings.json` file. If `deno.importMap` setting is not present it is still vulnerable if `import_map.json` is present in workspace root.

    4. **Trigger Dependency Resolution:**
        - Open the `test.ts` file in the editor.
        - VS Code Deno extension will attempt to resolve dependencies, including `std/fs/mod.ts`.

    5. **Verify Exploitation:**
        - Check the VS Code Output panel (select "Deno Language Server" in the dropdown). You should see "Malicious code executed from redirected module!" printed in the output if the malicious code in `malicious.js` was executed.
        - Check the workspace directory. A file named `pwned.txt` should have been created if the malicious code successfully wrote to the file system.

    This test case demonstrates that by opening a workspace with a malicious `import_map.json`, an attacker can achieve code execution when the Deno extension resolves modules, confirming the vulnerability.
