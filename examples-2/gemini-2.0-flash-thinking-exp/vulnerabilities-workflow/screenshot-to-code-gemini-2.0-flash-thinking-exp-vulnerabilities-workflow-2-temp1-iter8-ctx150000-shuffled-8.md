### Vulnerability 1: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code

* **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code
* **Description:**
    1. An attacker uploads a screenshot or video to the application via the frontend.
    2. The backend receives the image or video and utilizes AI models (like Claude or GPT) to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
    3. The backend transmits this AI-generated code to the frontend through a WebSocket connection.
    4. The frontend, upon receiving the code, dynamically renders it within the user's browser to display the generated web application.
    5. If the AI model inadvertently generates or is manipulated into generating malicious JavaScript code within the HTML output, and the frontend directly renders this code without proper sanitization, the malicious script will be executed in the user's browser.
    6. This can occur when the user interacts with or simply views the AI-generated code within the application's frontend.
* **Impact:**
    - Successful XSS exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser session when they interact with the generated code.
    - This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
        - Stealing session cookies, potentially compromising user accounts.
        - Redirecting users to attacker-controlled websites, possibly for phishing or malware distribution.
        - Performing actions on behalf of the user within the application.
        - Defacing the visual presentation of the generated web application.
* **Vulnerability Rank:** High
* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    -  No explicit sanitization of the AI-generated HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code is observed in the provided backend code. The backend's primary function is to generate and serve the code, not to sanitize it.
* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Frontend-Side Output Sanitization:** The most critical missing mitigation is the lack of sanitization in the frontend application. The frontend must implement robust sanitization of all AI-generated HTML, especially JavaScript code, before rendering it. This should involve using a well-vetted library like DOMPurify to strip out any potentially malicious scripts or event handlers.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) on the backend and enforced by the frontend web application could significantly reduce the risk and impact of XSS. A properly configured CSP would restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.) and can prevent the execution of inline JavaScript, which is a common vector for XSS attacks.
* **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs to use the application's intended functionality to upload either a screenshot or a video.
    - The AI model used in the backend must generate HTML code that contains malicious JavaScript. This could be due to vulnerabilities in the AI model itself, or if an attacker can find ways to influence the model's output (though prompt injection via image is less likely in this scenario).
* **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`backend/routes/generate_code.py`:** This file defines the WebSocket route `/generate-code` which is the core of the code generation process.
        - The `stream_code` function manages the WebSocket connection, receives parameters from the frontend, and orchestrates the interaction with the AI model.
        - The AI-generated code is streamed back to the frontend via the `send_message` function in chunks over the WebSocket.
        - The crucial point is that this backend code is only responsible for generating and transmitting the code. It does not include any steps to sanitize or validate the generated HTML, CSS, or JavaScript for security vulnerabilities.
    - **`backend/codegen/utils.py`:** The `extract_html_content` function is used to process the AI's response and extract the HTML code.
        - This function uses a regular expression to find content within `<html>` tags.
        - While it extracts the HTML, it performs no sanitization. Its purpose is purely to isolate the HTML portion of the AI's text output, not to secure it.
    - **Lack of Sanitization in Backend:** Review of the provided backend code reveals a complete absence of any HTML or JavaScript sanitization or encoding before the generated code is sent to the frontend. The backend trusts the AI's output to be safe, which is not a secure assumption, especially when dealing with dynamically generated code that will be rendered in a browser.
* **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Deploy a local instance of the `screenshot-to-code` application using the provided Docker setup or manual instructions. Ensure both backend and frontend are running and accessible.
    2. **Craft a Suspicious Screenshot:** Design a screenshot that might encourage the AI to generate JavaScript code, or try to embed a subtle XSS payload within the visual elements of the screenshot itself. A simple test screenshot could include text like  `<p>Hello <script>alert("XSS")</script> World</p>` rendered visually, or an input field and button combination.
    3. **Upload the Screenshot:** Using the application's frontend, upload the crafted screenshot and initiate the code generation process, selecting any supported stack.
    4. **Inspect the Generated Code (Frontend Inspection):**
        - After the code generation is complete and rendered in the frontend, use the browser's developer tools (usually by right-clicking and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element").
        - Examine the HTML source code of the generated output, particularly looking for `<script>` tags or any HTML attributes that could execute JavaScript (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`, `onclick`, and other event handlers).
        - Specifically, search for the XSS payload or any unexpected `<script>` tags or event attributes that the AI might have generated.
    5. **Alternative Payload Injection (WebSocket Interception):** If direct frontend inspection is difficult, or to more reliably test for XSS:
        - Use browser developer tools (Network tab, then filter for "ws" or WebSockets) to intercept the WebSocket messages as they are being received from the backend.
        - Identify the WebSocket message containing the AI-generated HTML code (it will likely be a JSON message with `type: "setCode"` and the HTML in the `value` field).
        - Before the frontend renders this code, manually modify the WebSocket message in the browser's developer tools to inject a simple, obvious XSS payload. For example, replace part of the generated HTML with: `<h1>Hello</h1><script>alert("XSS Vulnerability Detected!")</script>`.
        - Allow the frontend to process the modified WebSocket message and render the (now-malicious) code.
    6. **Verify XSS Execution:** Observe if the injected JavaScript code is executed in the browser. A successful XSS confirmation would be indicated by the execution of the injected script, for example, an alert box popping up in the browser displaying "XSS Vulnerability Detected!" or similar message.
    7. **Analyze Results:** If the JavaScript code executes, it definitively proves the existence of a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability because the application is rendering unsanitized, potentially attacker-influenced code directly in the user's browser.

If the test case successfully triggers JavaScript execution, it confirms the vulnerability. This test case demonstrates how an external attacker with access to the public instance can potentially trigger XSS.
