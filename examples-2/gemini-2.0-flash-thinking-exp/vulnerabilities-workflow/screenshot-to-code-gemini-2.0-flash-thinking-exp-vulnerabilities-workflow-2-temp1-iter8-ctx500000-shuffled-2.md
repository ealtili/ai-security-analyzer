### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in AI-Generated Code

* Description:
    1. A user uploads a screenshot or video to the application, intending to convert it into frontend code.
    2. The backend system uses an AI model (like Claude or GPT-4) to analyze the visual input and generate HTML, CSS, and Javascript code.
    3. The AI model, without proper security constraints or output sanitization, may inadvertently generate Javascript code that contains cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This can happen if the AI model includes user-provided or dynamically generated content into the Javascript code without proper encoding or validation.
    4. A malicious actor could then craft a specific input (screenshot or video) that subtly influences the AI model to generate Javascript code with exploitable XSS vulnerabilities.
    5. If a user deploys the generated website containing this malicious Javascript code, an attacker could exploit these XSS vulnerabilities. For example, by injecting malicious scripts into input fields or URLs that are then processed by the vulnerable Javascript code.
    6. When other users visit the deployed website and interact with the vulnerable parts, the attacker's injected script executes in their browsers.

* Impact:
    * High. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript code in the victim's browser when they visit a website generated by this tool. This could lead to:
        * **Data theft**: Stealing sensitive information like cookies, session tokens, or user data.
        * **Account hijacking**: Performing actions on behalf of the user, potentially gaining unauthorized access to accounts.
        * **Redirection to malicious websites**: Redirecting users to phishing sites or websites hosting malware.
        * **Defacement**: Altering the content of the web page seen by the user.
        * **Further exploitation**: Using the compromised website as a stepping stone to attack other systems or users.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None.  The provided project files do not include any explicit input sanitization for screenshots or videos to prevent prompt injection that leads to XSS.  Critically, there is no output sanitization of the AI-generated code to remove or neutralize potential XSS vectors before the code is served. The system prompts (e.g., in `prompts/screenshot_system_prompts.py` and `prompts/claude_prompts.py`) focus on functional and visual aspects of code generation but do not include directives for generating secure code or preventing XSS.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Output Sanitization:** Implement robust output sanitization on the backend before sending the generated code to the frontend. This should involve parsing the generated HTML and Javascript code and encoding or removing any potentially dangerous constructs, especially in Javascript sections that handle dynamic content or user inputs. Techniques like using a Javascript parser to identify and sanitize potentially unsafe code patterns should be considered.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers in the generated web pages. CSP can restrict the sources from which resources like scripts, stylesheets, and images can be loaded, significantly reducing the risk and impact of XSS attacks. The backend could be modified to automatically include a restrictive CSP meta tag or HTTP header in the generated HTML.
    * **Security Focused Prompts:** Refine the system prompts given to the AI models. These prompts should be updated to explicitly instruct the AI to avoid generating potentially insecure Javascript code patterns.  Prompts should emphasize the generation of safe and secure code and warn against using potentially unsafe functions like `innerHTML` without proper sanitization.
    * **User Security Warnings:** Display clear warnings to users about the potential security risks of deploying AI-generated code without careful security review. Advise users to manually audit the generated code for vulnerabilities before deploying it to a public-facing website.

* Preconditions:
    * An attacker needs to rely on the AI model's capability to generate Javascript code and the possibility that this generated code might contain XSS vulnerabilities.
    * A user must use the `screenshot-to-code` tool to generate frontend code.
    * The AI model selected for code generation must be capable of generating Javascript and must inadvertently generate vulnerable code in response to a user's input (screenshot/video).
    * The user must deploy the generated code without performing a security audit or implementing necessary security measures.
    * Users must visit the deployed website and interact with the vulnerable parts of the generated code for the XSS to be triggered.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`backend/routes/generate_code.py`**: This file handles the core logic for generating code.
        * It receives user input via WebSocket in the `/generate-code` endpoint.
        * It utilizes the `create_prompt` function from `prompts/__init__.py` to construct prompts for the LLM based on user parameters (screenshot, stack, etc.).
        * It then calls either `stream_claude_response_native` or `stream_openai_response` from `llm.py` to interact with the chosen AI model (Claude or GPT-4). The raw response from the LLM is obtained.
        * The raw, AI-generated code response is then passed to `codegen/utils.py`'s `extract_html_content` function.
        * The extracted HTML content is directly sent back to the frontend via the WebSocket using `send_message("setCode", updated_html, index)`.
        * **Crucially, there is no sanitization or security validation step applied to the AI-generated code before sending it to the frontend and for eventual deployment.**

    2. **`codegen/utils.py`**: Contains the `extract_html_content` function.
        * This function uses a regular expression `r"(<html.*?>.*?</html>)"` to extract content within `<html>` tags from the LLM's text response.
        * While this function helps to isolate the HTML code, it performs **no security sanitization or encoding** of the extracted HTML content. It simply returns the raw extracted HTML string.

    3. **`prompts` directory (e.g., `prompts/screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `prompts/claude_prompts.py`)**: Contains system prompts used to guide the AI models.
        * System prompts like `HTML_TAILWIND_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `REACT_TAILWIND_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, and `VIDEO_PROMPT` are designed to instruct the AI on code style, libraries to use (Tailwind, React, Bootstrap, etc.), and visual accuracy.
        * **None of the prompts explicitly instruct the AI model to generate secure code, avoid XSS vulnerabilities, or sanitize outputs.** The prompts are focused on functionality and visual replication, not security.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Deploy the `screenshot-to-code` application locally, following the instructions in `README.md`. Ensure you have the necessary API keys configured (OpenAI or Anthropic).
    2. **Craft Malicious Input (Screenshot):** Create a simple HTML mockup or take a screenshot of a webpage containing an input field (e.g., a search bar, comment box). Intentionally design the screenshot in a way that might subtly encourage the AI to use Javascript to handle the input dynamically. For instance, imply dynamic updates based on user input in the visual design. A simple example screenshot could be of a webpage with just an input field labeled "Enter your name" and a display area below it.
    3. **Generate Code:** In the `screenshot-to-code` frontend, upload the crafted screenshot. Select a stack that includes Javascript capabilities, such as "HTML + Tailwind" or "React + Tailwind". Click the "Generate Code" button.
    4. **Inspect Generated Code for Vulnerabilities:** Once the code is generated and displayed in the frontend:
        * Carefully examine the Javascript code within the generated HTML (look for `<script>` tags).
        * Specifically, search for patterns where user-provided input might be dynamically inserted into the HTML without proper sanitization. Look for usage of `innerHTML`, or similar DOM manipulation methods that directly render strings without encoding, especially if these strings seem derived from input fields or parameters.
        * An example vulnerable pattern to look for might be Javascript code that takes the value from an input field and sets it directly as `innerHTML` of another element without encoding HTML entities:
        ```javascript
        document.getElementById('outputArea').innerHTML = document.getElementById('inputField').value; // POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE
        ```
    5. **Prepare XSS Payload:** Create a simple XSS payload, such as: `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected!')</script>`.
    6. **Deploy and Test:**
        * Copy the generated HTML code. Save it as an HTML file (e.g., `xss_test.html`).
        * Open `xss_test.html` in a web browser. This simulates deploying the generated website.
        * Locate the input field on the deployed webpage.
        * Enter the XSS payload `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected!')</script>` into the input field.
        * Submit or trigger the Javascript that processes the input (this might be upon typing, on button click, or page load, depending on the generated code).
    7. **Verify XSS Execution:** Check if the XSS payload is executed:
        * **Expected Outcome (Vulnerability Confirmed):** An alert box should pop up in the browser, displaying the message "XSS Vulnerability Detected!". This indicates that the Javascript code generated by the AI model is indeed vulnerable to XSS, as it executed the injected script.
        * **No Alert (Mitigation or No Vulnerability):** If no alert box appears and the payload is treated as text, it might indicate that the AI either did not generate vulnerable code in this instance, or that there is some form of implicit or explicit sanitization (though none is apparent in the provided code). However, repeated testing with varied inputs is recommended to confirm absence of vulnerability, rather than relying on a single negative test case.

This test case is designed to provide a clear and reproducible method to verify the existence of the XSS vulnerability in the AI-generated code. Successful execution of the alert confirms the vulnerability, highlighting the need for implementing the missing mitigations.
