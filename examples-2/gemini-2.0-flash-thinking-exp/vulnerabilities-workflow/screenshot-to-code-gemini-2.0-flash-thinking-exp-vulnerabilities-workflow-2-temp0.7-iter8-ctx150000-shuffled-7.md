### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Prompt Injection via Malicious Screenshot/Screen Recording
- Description:
    1. A user uploads a screenshot or screen recording to the application.
    2. The application backend processes this visual input and sends it to an AI model (e.g., Claude, GPT-4o) along with a system prompt instructing the model to generate code based on the visual input.
    3. A malicious user crafts a screenshot or screen recording that includes text or visual elements designed to manipulate the AI model's behavior. For example, the malicious input could contain text like "`<html><script> malicious_code </script>...`" or instructions to include specific vulnerable code patterns.
    4. The AI model, interpreting the malicious content in the screenshot/screen recording as part of the design to be implemented, generates code that includes the injected malicious instructions.
    5. The application returns this AI-generated code to the user.
    6. If an unsuspecting user executes the generated code, the malicious injected code will be executed, leading to potential security breaches.
- Impact:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code injected into the generated HTML could be executed in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
    - Open Redirection: Injected code could redirect users to attacker-controlled websites, potentially for phishing or malware distribution.
    - Information Disclosure: Malicious code could be crafted to extract sensitive information from the user's environment or the generated application and send it to a remote server.
    - Remote Code Execution (in limited scenarios): While less likely in frontend code generation, in more complex scenarios or with backend interactions, prompt injection could potentially lead to server-side vulnerabilities if the generated code interacts with backend systems in an unsafe manner. In this project, the generated code is frontend code, so RCE is not a direct impact, but the generated vulnerable frontend code could interact with other backend systems if integrated into a larger application.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None explicitly identified in the provided project files to prevent prompt injection. The system prompts in `backend/prompts/screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `backend/prompts/imported_code_prompts.py`, and `backend/prompts/claude_prompts.py` focus on instructing the AI for code generation but do not include any input sanitization or output validation mechanisms to prevent prompt injection attacks.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Implement sanitization of the input screenshot or screen recording content before sending it to the AI model. This could involve techniques to detect and neutralize potentially malicious code or instructions within the visual input. However, visual sanitization is complex and might not be fully effective.
    - Output Validation: Implement validation of the AI-generated code before presenting it to the user. This could involve static code analysis to detect potentially vulnerable code patterns (e.g., `<script>` tags with inline JavaScript, `javascript:` URLs, unsafe HTML attributes).
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): While not a direct mitigation against prompt injection, implementing CSP in the generated code's HTML could limit the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by restricting the sources from which scripts can be loaded and other potentially harmful actions. However, this needs to be implemented in the generated code itself, which is currently not done.
    - User Awareness: Clearly communicate the risks associated with executing AI-generated code to the users. Warn them about the possibility of vulnerabilities and advise them to review and test the code carefully before deployment. This is a documentation/guidance mitigation, not a technical one.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to upload a crafted screenshot or screen recording to the application.
    - The application must be configured to use an AI model for code generation without sufficient prompt injection defenses.
    - A user must then execute the AI-generated code without proper review or security assessment.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `backend/prompts/__init__.py`: This file assembles prompts for the AI model using user inputs (screenshots, screen recordings). The `assemble_prompt` and `assemble_imported_code_prompt` functions take user-provided image data URLs and code snippets and incorporate them into prompts sent to the LLM. There is no sanitization or filtering of the content of the screenshots or screen recordings before they are processed by the AI model.
    - `backend/routes/generate_code.py`: This route handles the code generation process. It receives user input, assembles prompts, calls the AI model (`stream_openai_response`, `stream_claude_response`, `stream_claude_response_native`, `stream_gemini_response`), and returns the generated code to the frontend. The code does not include any input sanitization or output validation to prevent prompt injection. The `extract_html_content` function in `backend/codegen/utils.py` only extracts HTML content but does not perform any security-related validation or sanitization.
    - `backend/video/utils.py` and `backend/image_processing/utils.py`: These utilities handle video and image processing respectively, converting them into formats suitable for AI model input. They do not perform any sanitization of the content within the visual inputs to prevent prompt injection.
    - System prompts in `backend/prompts/screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `backend/prompts/imported_code_prompts.py`, and `backend/prompts/claude_prompts.py` instruct the AI models for code generation but do not include instructions to handle potentially malicious input or generate secure code.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Access the publicly available instance of the screenshot-to-code application.
    2. Prepare a malicious screenshot (e.g., using an image editor or by modifying a webpage and taking a screenshot). This screenshot should contain text that includes a JavaScript alert within HTML tags, for example:
        ```html
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <title>Malicious Screenshot</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>This is a normal heading</h1>
            <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>
        </body>
        </html>
        ```
    3. Upload this malicious screenshot to the application using the "Screenshot" input mode and select any supported stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind).
    4. Click the "Generate Code" button.
    5. After the code generation is complete, copy the generated HTML code.
    6. Open a new HTML file in your browser or use an online HTML viewer and paste the generated code into it.
    7. Open the HTML file in your browser.
    8. Observe if an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" appears.
    9. If the alert box appears, it confirms that the malicious JavaScript code from the screenshot was successfully injected into the generated code and executed, demonstrating a prompt injection vulnerability.
