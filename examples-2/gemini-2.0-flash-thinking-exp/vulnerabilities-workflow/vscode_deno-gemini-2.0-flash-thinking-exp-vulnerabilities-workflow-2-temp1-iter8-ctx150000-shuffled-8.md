- Vulnerability Name: Deno Executable Path Injection
  - Description:
    1. An attacker can control the `deno.path` setting in VS Code configuration.
    2. If the attacker sets `deno.path` to a malicious executable, when the extension attempts to execute Deno commands (like `deno lsp`, `deno cache`, `deno test`, etc.), it will execute the attacker-controlled executable instead of the legitimate Deno CLI.
    3. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when the extension is activated or any Deno command is triggered by the extension.
  - Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Critical
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided code. The extension retrieves and uses the path directly without validation.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of the `deno.path` setting.
    - Verification that the executable at `deno.path` is indeed the Deno CLI, possibly by checking its signature or version.
    - Restricting execution path to a predefined safe list or prompting user confirmation before executing from a custom path.
  - Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a workspace with a malicious VS Code configuration (e.g., workspace settings, user settings if configured globally).
    - The user must have the Deno extension for VS Code installed and activated.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `client\src\util.ts`
    2. Function: `getDenoCommandPath()`
    3. Line: `const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();` - Retrieves `deno.path` from workspace configuration without any validation.
    4. Line: `return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();` - If `deno.path` is set, it is directly used.
    5. Function: `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`
    6. Line: `const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string>("path");` - Directly gets the string value of `deno.path`.
    7. The `getDenoCommandPath()` function returns this path directly, which is later used in `client\src\commands.ts`, `client\src\debug_config_provider.ts`, `client\src\tasks.ts` to execute Deno CLI commands using `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
    8. No validation or sanitization is performed on the `exePath` obtained from configuration.

  - Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious executable file (e.g., `malicious_deno.bat` on Windows or `malicious_deno.sh` on Linux/macOS) that will execute arbitrary commands (e.g., create a file in the user's temp directory).
    2. Create a VS Code workspace.
    3. In the workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`), set `"deno.path": "path/to/malicious_deno"`, where `"path/to/malicious_deno"` is the path to the malicious executable created in step 1. Use relative or absolute path based on OS.
    4. Open the workspace in VS Code with the Deno extension activated.
    5. Trigger any Deno command in VS Code that causes the extension to execute the Deno CLI. For example, use the command "Deno: Cache" on any Deno file, or trigger testing code lens "Run Test".
    6. Observe that the malicious executable is executed instead of the real Deno CLI. Verify the arbitrary command execution by checking for the file created by the malicious executable in the temp directory.
