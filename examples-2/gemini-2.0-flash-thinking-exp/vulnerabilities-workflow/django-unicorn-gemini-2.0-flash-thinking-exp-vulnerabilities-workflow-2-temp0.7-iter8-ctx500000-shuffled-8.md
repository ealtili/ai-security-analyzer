- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsafe Template Rendering

- Description:
  1. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into user-controlled data fields within a Django Unicorn component.
  2. This malicious code is then stored as component state on the server.
  3. When the component is rendered (either initially or via AJAX update), the injected JavaScript is included in the HTML response without proper sanitization.
  4. The victim's browser executes this malicious JavaScript when rendering the HTML, leading to XSS.
  5. This can occur through `unicorn:model` attributes, action arguments, or any mechanism where user input becomes part of the template rendering context without explicit sanitization.

- Impact:
  - Account Takeover: Attackers can steal session cookies or credentials, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
  - Data Theft: Sensitive user data or application data can be exfiltrated.
  - Malware Distribution: The attacker can redirect users to malicious websites or inject malware into the application.
  - Defacement: The application's appearance can be altered, potentially damaging the application's reputation.
  - Phishing: Users can be tricked into providing sensitive information on attacker-controlled pages disguised as part of the application.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - Django's default template auto-escaping is active, which helps prevent basic XSS attacks by escaping HTML characters in template variables.
  - CSRF protection is mentioned as a security feature, but it mitigates CSRF attacks, not XSS directly.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input Sanitization: The project lacks explicit input sanitization for user-provided data before rendering it in templates. Django's auto-escaping is the primary defense, but it's not sufficient in all cases, especially if `safe` filter or similar mechanisms are used.
  - Context-Aware Output Encoding: While Django's auto-escaping is context-aware to some extent, more robust context-aware output encoding mechanisms specifically designed for dynamic DOM updates in AJAX-driven components might be missing.
  - Documentation and Best Practices: The documentation does not prominently warn about XSS risks or provide clear guidelines on how to sanitize user inputs within Django Unicorn components. Although, it mentions HTML encoding for updated field values as a security fix in Changelog v0.36.0.

- Preconditions:
  - The application must use Django Unicorn components to render user-provided data in templates.
  - There must be a user input field (e.g., using `unicorn:model`) that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary text.
  - The injected data must be rendered in the template without additional explicit sanitization (beyond Django's default auto-escaping, and assuming `safe` filter is not misused).

- Source Code Analysis:
  - Based on the provided documentation, the core vulnerability lies in the server-side rendering process and how user input is integrated into the template context.
  - Files like `docs\source\templates.md` and `docs\source\components.md` explain how `unicorn:model` binds user input to component properties and how these properties are rendered in templates.
  - The `docs\source\views.md` file describes how class variables are serialized and passed to the template, and how custom classes can be serialized with `to_json`. This serialization and rendering process is where unsanitized data can become a vulnerability.
  - The `docs\source\settings.md` mentions `MORPHER.RELOAD_SCRIPT_ELEMENTS`, `MINIFY_HTML`, and `SERIAL` settings, which are not directly related to XSS mitigation.
  - The Changelog `docs\source\changelog.md` mentions a "Security fix: for CVE-2021-42053 to prevent XSS attacks" in version v0.36.0, indicating a past vulnerability and a fix involving HTML encoding. However, the details of this fix are not fully described, and it's unclear if it comprehensively addresses all XSS attack vectors, especially with complex user interactions and potential bypasses.
  - File `docs\source\views.md` under section `Meta` describes `safe` option: "By default, unicorn HTML encodes updated field values to prevent XSS attacks. You need to explicitly opt-in to allow a field to be returned without being encoded by adding it to the Meta class's safe tuple." - This highlights the risk of bypassing default sanitization and potential for XSS if `safe` is misused.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Create a Django Unicorn component with a text input field bound to a component property using `unicorn:model`. Example component template:
     ```html
     <div>
       <input type="text" unicorn:model="userInput">
       <div id="output">{{ userInput }}</div>
     </div>
     ```
     Example component view:
     ```python
     from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

     class XssTestView(UnicornView):
         userInput = ""
     ```
  2. Render this component in a Django template and serve it through a Django view.
  3. As an attacker, input the following XSS payload into the text input field: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`
  4. Observe the rendered HTML source code in the browser after typing the payload.
  5. Verify if the JavaScript alert `alert('XSS')` is executed when the component updates (either on input or blur, depending on modifiers).
  6. If the alert is executed, the vulnerability is confirmed. If the HTML is properly sanitized (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` is rendered as text and not as an image tag with an `onerror` event), then the vulnerability is not directly exploitable in this basic scenario with default auto-escaping.
