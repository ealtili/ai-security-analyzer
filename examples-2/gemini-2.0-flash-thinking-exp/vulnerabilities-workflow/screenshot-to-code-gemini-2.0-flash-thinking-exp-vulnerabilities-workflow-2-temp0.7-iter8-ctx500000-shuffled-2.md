### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Image Processing Vulnerability via PIL Library
- Description:
    1. An attacker uploads a maliciously crafted image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG, or other formats supported by PIL) to the application.
    2. The backend receives the image as a base64 data URL.
    3. In `backend/image_processing/utils.py`, the `process_image` function decodes the base64 data and uses `PIL.Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes))` to open the image.
    4. If the uploaded image is specifically crafted to exploit a vulnerability in the PIL library (e.g., an image parsing vulnerability, buffer overflow, or other image format specific flaws), it could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server or other security impacts depending on the nature of the PIL vulnerability.
    5. This vulnerability is triggered during the image processing stage when the backend attempts to prepare the image for Claude API, specifically within the `process_image` function.
- Impact:
    - High. Successful exploitation could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the backend server, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the server, access sensitive data, or perform other malicious actions. The impact severity depends on the specific vulnerability within the PIL library that is exploited.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project resizes and recompresses images in `backend/image_processing/utils.py` to meet Claude's requirements. This might inadvertently mitigate some vulnerabilities if the resizing or re-encoding process removes or alters the malicious parts of the image. However, this is not a security mitigation by design and should not be relied upon.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement robust validation of uploaded image files before processing them with PIL. This includes:
        - File type validation: Restrict allowed image file types to a safe subset if possible, or strictly validate the file type based on content rather than just the extension.
        - File size limits: Enforce reasonable limits on the size of uploaded image files to prevent resource exhaustion and potential buffer overflows.
        - Content security scanning: Integrate an image security scanning library or service to detect and block known malicious image patterns or signatures before processing with PIL.
    - Security updates: Regularly update the PIL library to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Sandboxing/Isolation: Run the image processing in a sandboxed environment or container with limited privileges to contain the impact of a successful exploit.
- Preconditions:
    - The application must be running and accessible to accept image uploads.
    - The backend must be configured to use the `process_image` function from `backend/image_processing/utils.py` for image handling, which is the case when using Claude models.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `backend/image_processing/utils.py`
    ```python
    from PIL import Image
    import io
    import base64

    def process_image(image_data_url: str) -> tuple[str, str]:
        # ...
        base64_data = image_data_url.split(",")[1]
        image_bytes = base64.b64decode(base64_data)
        img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes)) # Vulnerable line
        # ...
    ```
    - The vulnerability lies in the `Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes))` line. The `Image.open` function in PIL is known to be susceptible to various image processing vulnerabilities depending on the image format and PIL version. By providing a specially crafted image, an attacker could potentially trigger a vulnerability in PIL during the image opening or decoding process.
    - The code proceeds to resize and recompress the image, but if the vulnerability is triggered during the `Image.open` call, these subsequent steps might not prevent the exploit.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a malicious image file that is known to exploit a vulnerability in the version of PIL used by the backend. Publicly available resources like security vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases) or security research websites can be used to find such images or techniques to create them. For example, research known vulnerabilities in PIL related to image format parsing (e.g., PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc.).
    2. Encode the malicious image file into a base64 data URL.
    3. Using the frontend of the application, upload the generated base64 data URL as an image input. Choose any stack and model configuration that triggers image processing on the backend (e.g., Claude models).
    4. Submit the request to generate code from the (malicious) image.
    5. Monitor the backend server for any signs of exploitation, such as:
        - Unexpected errors or crashes in the backend application.
        - Unauthorized file access or modifications.
        - Network connections originating from the backend server to unexpected external hosts (if the exploit attempts to establish a reverse shell or exfiltrate data).
        - CPU or memory exhaustion on the server.
    6. If exploitation is successful, you might observe that the server becomes unresponsive, crashes, or exhibits other abnormal behaviors indicating a security breach. Examine server logs for detailed error messages or stack traces that confirm a PIL vulnerability was triggered.

- Vulnerability Name: Video Processing Vulnerability via MoviePy and PIL Libraries
- Description:
    1. An attacker uploads a maliciously crafted video file (e.g., MOV, MP4, or other formats supported by MoviePy) to the application.
    2. The backend receives the video as a base64 data URL.
    3. In `backend/video/utils.py`, the `split_video_into_screenshots` function decodes the base64 data, saves it to a temporary file, and uses `moviepy.editor.VideoFileClip(temp_video_file.name)` to open the video.
    4. MoviePy in turn uses PIL to process frames from the video. If the uploaded video is crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in either MoviePy's video handling or PIL's image processing when handling video frames, it could lead to security issues, including arbitrary code execution.
    5. This vulnerability is triggered when processing video input, specifically in the `split_video_into_screenshots` function during video decoding and frame extraction.
- Impact:
    - High. Similar to the image processing vulnerability, successful exploitation of video processing flaws in MoviePy or PIL could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the backend server, potentially granting the attacker full control.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Similar to image processing, there are no explicit security mitigations. Splitting video into screenshots and using a limited number of screenshots (TARGET_NUM_SCREENSHOTS) might reduce the attack surface, but does not prevent exploitation if a single frame or video processing step is vulnerable.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement robust validation for uploaded video files, including:
        - File type validation: Restrict allowed video file types and validate based on content.
        - File size and duration limits: Enforce limits to prevent resource exhaustion and potential buffer overflows.
        - Content security scanning: Integrate video/image security scanning to detect malicious patterns before processing.
    - Security updates: Regularly update MoviePy and PIL libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Sandboxing/Isolation: Isolate video processing in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of exploits.
- Preconditions:
    - The application must be running and accessible to accept video uploads.
    - The backend must be configured to process video inputs, specifically using `backend/video/utils.py`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `backend/video/utils.py`
    ```python
    from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip
    from PIL import Image
    import tempfile
    import base64
    import mimetypes

    def split_video_into_screenshots(video_data_url: str) -> list[Image.Image]:
        # ...
        video_bytes = base64.b64decode(video_encoded_data)
        mime_type = video_data_url.split(";")[0].split(":")[1]
        suffix = mimetypes.guess_extension(mime_type)

        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=suffix, delete=True) as temp_video_file:
            temp_video_file.write(video_bytes)
            temp_video_file.flush()
            clip = VideoFileClip(temp_video_file.name) # Vulnerable line
            images: list[Image.Image] = []
            # ...
            for i, frame in enumerate(clip.iter_frames()): # Potentially vulnerable frame processing
                frame_image = Image.fromarray(frame) # Vulnerable line
                images.append(frame_image)
                # ...
            clip.close()
            return images
    ```
    - The lines `clip = VideoFileClip(temp_video_file.name)` and `frame_image = Image.fromarray(frame)` are potential vulnerability points. `VideoFileClip` might be vulnerable to issues in video decoding, and `Image.fromarray(frame)` uses PIL to create an image from video frame data, which can also be vulnerable if the frame data is maliciously crafted. Exploiting vulnerabilities in video codecs or frame handling within MoviePy or PIL could lead to RCE.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a malicious video file designed to exploit a vulnerability in MoviePy or PIL during video processing or frame extraction. Research known vulnerabilities in video processing libraries or techniques to create such files.
    2. Encode the malicious video file into a base64 data URL.
    3. Using the frontend, upload the generated base64 data URL as a video input.
    4. Submit the request to generate code from the (malicious) video.
    5. Monitor the backend server for signs of exploitation, similar to the image processing test case: unexpected errors, crashes, unauthorized access, network connections, resource exhaustion.
    6. Analyze server logs for error messages or stack traces to confirm if a video processing vulnerability in MoviePy or PIL was triggered.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection via Filename Handling in Image/Video Processing (Low Likelihood, Needs Further Investigation)
- Description:
    1. An attacker attempts to upload a file (image or video) with a maliciously crafted filename.
    2. During video processing in `backend/video/utils.py`, the code uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=suffix, delete=True)` to create a temporary file. The `suffix` is derived from the MIME type of the uploaded video. While `NamedTemporaryFile` itself is generally safe, if the `suffix` is not properly sanitized and is later used in a command-line operation by MoviePy or another part of the system, it could potentially lead to command injection.
    3. Similarly, if filenames derived from user inputs are used in other file system operations without proper sanitization throughout the application, there's a theoretical risk of command injection if these filenames are passed to shell commands.
    4. This vulnerability is highly dependent on how filenames are handled and if they are unsafely incorporated into shell commands within MoviePy or in other parts of the backend code not immediately evident from the provided files.
- Impact:
    - Medium to High (depending on the context of command execution). If command injection is possible, the attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to RCE. The likelihood is considered low because the provided code snippets don't directly show unsanitized filename usage in shell commands, but a deeper code audit would be needed to rule it out completely, especially within the internal workings of MoviePy or any system calls it might make.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium (pending further investigation, potentially High if confirmed)
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` is used, which is designed to create temporary files securely. However, this does not automatically sanitize the `suffix`.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Filename sanitization: Sanitize filenames derived from user inputs, especially MIME type extensions, before using them in file system operations, especially if they are ever used in shell commands (though not immediately apparent in the provided code, this is a general best practice). Ensure that filenames only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, and periods, and disallow shell-sensitive characters.
    - Code audit: Conduct a thorough code audit of MoviePy's internal operations and the entire backend codebase to identify any places where filenames derived from user inputs might be used in shell commands without proper sanitization.
- Preconditions:
    - The application must be running and accept file uploads.
    - The backend video processing functionality must be used.
    - A vulnerability must exist where a filename suffix or similar user-controlled string is passed unsafely to a shell command, either directly in the project code or within a library used by the project (like MoviePy).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `backend/video/utils.py`
    ```python
    import tempfile
    import mimetypes

    def split_video_into_screenshots(video_data_url: str) -> list[Image.Image]:
        # ...
        mime_type = video_data_url.split(";")[0].split(":")[1]
        suffix = mimetypes.guess_extension(mime_type) # User controlled suffix
        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=suffix, delete=True) as temp_video_file: # Suffix passed here
            temp_video_file.write(video_bytes)
            temp_video_file.flush()
            clip = VideoFileClip(temp_video_file.name)
            # ...
    ```
    - The `suffix` variable, derived from the user-provided MIME type, is passed to `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`. While `NamedTemporaryFile` is secure in creating files, the `suffix` itself is not sanitized and might be used unsafely later. A deeper audit of MoviePy's code and how it uses temporary files and filenames would be needed to confirm if this poses a command injection risk.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a video file and manipulate its MIME type in the data URL to include a malicious suffix that could be interpreted as a command if unsafely used in a shell operation. For example, try setting the MIME type to `video/mp4; sh -c "touch /tmp/pwned"` if you suspect the suffix might be used in a shell command.
    2. Encode this video file with the malicious MIME type suffix into a base64 data URL.
    3. Upload this data URL as a video input using the frontend.
    4. Submit the request to generate code from the video.
    5. Monitor the backend server to see if the command injection is successful. For the example suffix above, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created on the server after processing the video.
    6. If successful, the presence of `/tmp/pwned` (or other indicators depending on the injected command) confirms command injection. If unsuccessful, it does not definitively rule out other forms of command injection in different parts of the video processing pipeline or with different payloads. A comprehensive code audit is needed for complete assurance.
