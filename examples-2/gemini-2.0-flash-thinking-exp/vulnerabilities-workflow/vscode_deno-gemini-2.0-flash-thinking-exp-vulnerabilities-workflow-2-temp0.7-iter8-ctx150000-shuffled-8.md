### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious `deno.path` Configuration

- Description:
    1. An attacker uses social engineering techniques to convince a user to manually configure the `deno.path` setting in the VS Code Deno extension.
    2. The attacker tricks the user into specifying a path to a malicious executable file instead of the legitimate Deno CLI executable.
    3. When the VS Code Deno extension attempts to execute a Deno CLI command (e.g., for formatting, linting, testing, tasks, debugging, or language server operations), it retrieves the executable path from the `deno.path` setting.
    4. Consequently, the extension executes the attacker-controlled malicious executable instead of the intended Deno CLI.
    5. This allows the malicious executable to run with the same privileges as the VS Code process, resulting in arbitrary code execution within the user's environment.

- Impact:
    Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This can lead to severe consequences, including:
    - Complete compromise of the user's system.
    - Theft of sensitive data and credentials.
    - Installation of malware, ransomware, or other malicious software.
    - Unauthorized access to system resources and network.
    - Data manipulation or destruction.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The extension code does not implement any specific mitigations to prevent this vulnerability. The `README.md` documentation advises users to install the Deno CLI and configure the `deno.path` setting if necessary, but it lacks explicit warnings about the security risks of pointing `deno.path` to untrusted executables.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Validation: Implement validation checks for the `deno.path` setting. This could include:
        - Verifying that the specified path is a valid executable file.
        - Checking if the executable path is within a reasonable and expected location for Deno CLI installations.
        - Potentially verifying the digital signature or cryptographic hash of the executable to ensure it matches a known-good Deno CLI binary.
    - User Interface Warning: Enhance the VS Code settings UI for the `deno.path` setting to display a prominent warning message. This warning should clearly articulate the security risks associated with configuring `deno.path` to untrusted or unknown executables. Emphasize that users should only point this setting to the legitimate Deno CLI executable from a trusted source.
    - Documentation Enhancement: Update the extension's documentation, particularly the `README.md` and configuration sections, to explicitly and strongly warn users about the security implications of misconfiguring the `deno.path` setting. Provide clear guidance on how to securely configure this setting and the risks of pointing it to untrusted executables.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension installed and activated in VS Code.
    - The attacker must successfully socially engineer the user into modifying the `deno.path` setting within VS Code's settings.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - `client/src/util.ts`:
        - `getDenoCommandPath()` function is responsible for resolving the absolute path to the Deno CLI executable.
        - `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` retrieves the value of the `deno.path` setting from VS Code's workspace configuration.
        - `getDefaultDenoCommand()` attempts to locate the Deno CLI executable in the system's PATH environment variable and default installation directories if `deno.path` is not set.
        - The logic prioritizes the `deno.path` setting if it is configured. If `deno.path` is set, the extension directly uses this path without any validation or security checks.
    - `client/src/tasks.ts`, `client/src/tasks_sidebar.ts`, `client/src/debug_config_provider.ts`, `client/src/extension.ts`:
        - These files and modules utilize the `getDenoCommandName()` or `getDenoCommandPath()` functions to obtain the Deno CLI executable path.
        - Subsequently, they use this resolved path to execute Deno CLI commands for various features such as task execution, debugging, and language server functionalities.
        - No input validation or sanitization is performed on the path obtained from `deno.path` before executing the external command.

    - Code Snippet from `client/src/util.ts`:
    ```typescript
    async function getDenoCommandPath() {
      const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath(); // Retrieves deno.path setting
      const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
      if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
        return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
      } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
        // ... (relative path resolution logic) ...
      } else {
        return command; // Directly returns user-configured path without validation
      }
    }
    ```

        ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Executable:**
        - Create a new directory, for example, `malicious_deno_dir`.
        - Inside `malicious_deno_dir`, create a file named `deno` (or `deno.bat` on Windows).
        - Add the following script content to `deno` (or `deno.bat`), making it executable:

            - **For Linux/macOS (`deno`):**
              ```bash
              #!/bin/bash
              echo "[MALICIOUS DENO EXECUTABLE]: Executed!"
              open -a Calculator # Example: Attempt to open Calculator on macOS
              # Add more malicious commands here if needed
              "$@" # Pass through original arguments to mimic Deno behavior (optional for testing)
              ```
            - **For Windows (`deno.bat`):**
              ```batch
              @echo off
              echo [MALICIOUS DENO EXECUTABLE]: Executed!
              start calc.exe  # Example: Attempt to open Calculator on Windows
              rem Add more malicious commands here if needed
              deno %* # Pass through original arguments to mimic Deno behavior (optional for testing) - Assumes 'deno' is in PATH for passthrough
              ```
        - Ensure the `deno` (or `deno.bat`) file is executable (e.g., `chmod +x malicious_deno_dir/deno` on Linux/macOS).

    2. **Configure VS Code Deno Extension Settings:**
        - Open VS Code.
        - Go to Settings (File > Preferences > Settings, or Code > Settings > Settings on macOS).
        - Search for "deno.path".
        - In the "Deno â€º Path" setting, enter the absolute path to the `malicious_deno` (or `malicious_deno.bat`) executable you created in step 1. For example: `/path/to/malicious_deno_dir/deno` or `C:\path\to\malicious_deno_dir\deno.bat`.

    3. **Trigger Deno Extension Feature:**
        - Open any TypeScript or JavaScript file in VS Code.
        - Ensure Deno is enabled for the workspace (either by having a `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` file or by enabling it in workspace settings).
        - Trigger a Deno extension feature that executes a Deno command. For example:
            - **Format a document:** Right-click in the editor and select "Format Document With..." and choose "Deno".
            - **Run linting:** Save the file (if linting on save is enabled) or manually trigger linting (if available as a command).
            - **Run a test:** If you have Deno test code, use the "Run Test" code lens or Deno Tasks sidebar to execute a test.
            - **Debug:** Attempt to debug a Deno file using the debug configurations.
            - **Execute a Deno Task:** Use the Deno Tasks sidebar to run any defined Deno task.

    4. **Observe Malicious Execution:**
        - After triggering a Deno extension feature, observe the following:
            - In the VS Code Output panel (select "Deno Language Server" from the dropdown), you should see the message "[MALICIOUS DENO EXECUTABLE]: Executed!". This confirms that your malicious executable was run by the extension.
            - You should also observe the side effect of your malicious script, for example, the Calculator application should open (if you used the example scripts).

    5. **Expected Result:**
        - The test case successfully demonstrates that by configuring `deno.path` to point to a malicious executable, you can hijack the Deno extension's command execution and achieve arbitrary code execution. This validates the vulnerability.
