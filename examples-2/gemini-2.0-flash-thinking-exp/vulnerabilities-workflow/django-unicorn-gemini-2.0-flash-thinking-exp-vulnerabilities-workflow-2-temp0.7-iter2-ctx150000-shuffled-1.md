- Vulnerability Name: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsafe template rendering
  - Description:
    1. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into user-provided data.
    2. If this user-provided data is rendered in Django templates within Unicorn components without proper escaping.
    3. The malicious JavaScript code will be executed in the victim's browser when the component is rendered.
    4. This can happen when the component is initially loaded or during subsequent updates via AJAX calls.
  - Impact:
    - Account Compromise: Attackers can steal user session cookies or credentials, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - Data Theft: Attackers can steal sensitive information displayed on the page or accessible to the user.
    - Malicious Actions: Attackers can perform actions on behalf of the user, such as making unauthorized transactions or modifying data.
    - Website Defacement: Attackers can alter the visual appearance of the website.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - CSRF protection is implemented to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. The documentation mentions HTML encoding in responses since v0.36.0, which is a mitigation for XSS. The code includes `sanitize_html` function in `django_unicorn\utils.py` which is used to escape HTML characters when embedding component initialization data within `<script>` tags in `django_unicorn\components\unicorn_template_response.py`. This function helps to mitigate XSS in this specific context. However, the extent and consistency of output escaping for user-provided data rendered directly within component templates are not fully detailed and require further investigation. Django's template engine's auto-escaping is assumed to be the primary mitigation.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Robust output escaping of all user-provided data rendered in Django templates within Unicorn components. While Django's template engine has auto-escaping, explicit checks and potentially more aggressive escaping within Unicorn's component rendering process might be necessary to ensure complete protection, especially when handling data from `unicorn:model` bindings and arguments passed to component actions.
    - Input sanitization to proactively cleanse user-provided data of potentially malicious scripts before it is processed or rendered.
    - Comprehensive security testing, including penetration testing and automated security scans, specifically targeting XSS vulnerabilities in Unicorn components to validate the effectiveness of current mitigations and identify any bypasses.
  - Preconditions:
    - The application utilizes Django templates to render Unicorn components.
    - User input, potentially from `unicorn:model` bindings or arguments passed to component actions, is incorporated into the component's data and subsequently rendered in the template.
    - Output escaping mechanisms are either not consistently applied or insufficient to neutralize all forms of malicious JavaScript injection in Unicorn components, despite Django's default auto-escaping and the use of `sanitize_html` in specific contexts.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - The documentation confirms that Django templates are used for rendering Unicorn components, and `unicorn:model` facilitates data binding between templates and component properties.
    - Examples in documentation demonstrate rendering component data within templates using Django template syntax (e.g., `{{ name }}`).
    - The file `django_unicorn\utils.py` contains `sanitize_html` function which uses `html.escape` to escape HTML special characters. This function is used in `django_unicorn\components\unicorn_template_response.py` when generating the initialization script for components. Specifically, the `init` data, which includes component properties, is passed through `sanitize_html` before being embedded within a `<script>` tag with `application/json` type. This is a positive step for mitigating XSS when component data is embedded in script tags.
    - However, the code does not explicitly demonstrate or document consistent output escaping for user-provided data rendered directly within the component templates themselves. Django's template engine's auto-escaping is implicitly relied upon for template rendering.
    - It is assumed that if user-provided data bound to component properties is rendered directly in templates without explicit and consistent escaping *beyond Django's default auto-escaping*, a potential XSS vulnerability exists. Deeper code analysis and security testing are required to confirm the extent of output escaping applied by django-unicorn in various rendering contexts, especially when handling user input from `unicorn:model` and action arguments, to ensure that Django's auto-escaping is consistently effective and no bypasses are present within the Unicorn framework.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a Django project with django-unicorn installed and configured.
    2. Create a Unicorn component with a property, for example, `user_input_text`, initialized as an empty string in the component's Python view.
    3. In the component's template, render the `user_input_text` property using Django template syntax: `<div>{{ user_input_text }}</div>`.
    4. Add an input field in the template, binding it to the `user_input_text` property using `unicorn:model`: `<input type="text" unicorn:model="user_input_text">`.
    5. Deploy the Django application to a test environment accessible to external testers.
    6. Access the page containing the Unicorn component in a web browser.
    7. In the input field, inject a standard XSS payload, such as: `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability')</script>`.
    8. Observe the behavior of the web page.
        - If a JavaScript alert box appears with the message "XSS Vulnerability", this confirms the vulnerability.
        - Examine the HTML source of the page rendered by the component. If the injected `<script>` tag is present in the HTML source without being properly escaped (e.g., rendered as `&lt;script&gt;`), this also indicates a potential XSS vulnerability.
    9. Further test with different XSS payloads, including those that attempt to bypass common sanitization or escaping techniques, to comprehensively assess the vulnerability.
