## Vulnerability List for vscode_deno Extension

Based on the provided project files, no vulnerabilities of class RCE, Command Injection, or Code Injection with a rank of high or critical were identified that are directly introduced by the project code itself and exploitable by a malicious repository.

It is important to note that this analysis is based on static code review of the provided files and may not cover all potential vulnerabilities. Dynamic analysis and further in-depth review might reveal other issues.

It is also important to consider that the extension relies on the Deno CLI, and vulnerabilities in the Deno CLI itself could indirectly affect the security of the extension. However, vulnerabilities in the Deno CLI are outside the scope of this analysis, which is focused on vulnerabilities introduced by the VSCode extension project files.

Therefore, based on the current analysis and constraints, there are no vulnerabilities to report in the requested categories and rank.
