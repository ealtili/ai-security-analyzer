- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Task Execution via `deno.envFile` and `deno.env` settings

- Description:
    - The Deno VS Code extension allows users to configure tasks for Deno CLI.
    - Task definitions can include environment variables via `DenoTaskDefinition.env`.
    - The extension reads environment variables from `.env` files specified in `deno.envFile` setting and also from `deno.env` setting in `settings.json`.
    - When executing tasks (e.g., `deno run`, `deno test`, `deno upgrade`), the extension passes these environment variables to the `Deno CLI` process.
    - If a malicious user can control the content of `.env` file (via a crafted Deno project) or `deno.env` setting (if configured at workspace level), they can inject malicious commands within the environment variable values.
    - When the extension executes a Deno task, these injected commands within environment variables can be executed by the shell, leading to arbitrary code execution.

- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine.
    - A malicious actor could craft a Deno project with a specially crafted `.env` file or trick a developer into adding malicious entries to their workspace `deno.env` settings.
    - Opening this project in VS Code with the Deno extension enabled and running any Deno task (directly, via code lens, or tasks sidebar) will trigger the vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly passes the provided environment variables to the `ProcessExecution` API in VS Code, which then executes the Deno CLI command with these environments.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation for environment variables from `.env` files and `deno.env` settings.
    - Ideally, environment variables should be passed to the child process in a way that prevents shell interpretation of commands within variable values.  Using argument escaping or a direct API for setting environment variables without shell involvement might be needed.

- Preconditions:
    - Deno VS Code extension is installed and enabled.
    - User opens a workspace or folder containing a crafted Deno project with a malicious `.env` file, or has malicious entries in workspace `deno.env` settings.
    - User executes any Deno task within this workspace (e.g., run, test, cache, upgrade) via command, code lens, or tasks sidebar.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **`client\src\commands.ts` - `test` function:**
        ```typescript
        const env = {} as Record<string, string>;
        const denoEnvFile = config.get<string>("envFile");
        if (denoEnvFile) {
          if (workspaceFolder) {
            const denoEnvPath = path.join(workspaceFolder.uri.fsPath, denoEnvFile);
            try {
              const content = fs.readFileSync(denoEnvPath, { encoding: "utf8" });
              const parsed = dotenv.parse(content);
              Object.assign(env, parsed); // Vulnerability: Unsafe parsing of .env content
            } catch (error) {
              vscode.window.showErrorMessage(
                `Could not read env file "${denoEnvPath}": ${error}`,
              );
            }
          }
        }
        const denoEnv = config.get<Record<string, string>>("env");
        if (denoEnv) {
          Object.assign(env, denoEnv); // Vulnerability: Unsafe merging of deno.env settings
        }

        const definition: tasks.DenoTaskDefinition = {
          type: tasks.TASK_TYPE,
          command: "test",
          args,
          env, // Vulnerability: Passing unsanitized env to task definition
        };
        // ...
        const task = tasks.buildDenoTask(workspaceFolder, denoCommand, definition, `test "${name}"`, args, ["$deno-test"]);
        await vscode.tasks.executeTask(task); // Vulnerability: Task execution with potentially malicious env
        ```
    - **`client\src\upgrade.ts` - `denoUpgradePromptAndExecute` function:**
        ```typescript
        const env = {} as Record<string, string>;
        const denoEnvFile = config.get<string>("envFile");
        if (denoEnvFile) {
          if (workspaceFolder) {
            const denoEnvPath = join(workspaceFolder.uri.fsPath, denoEnvFile);
            try {
              const content = readFileSync(denoEnvPath, { encoding: "utf8" });
              const parsed = dotenv.parse(content);
              Object.assign(env, parsed); // Vulnerability: Unsafe parsing of .env content
            } catch (error) {
              vscode.window.showErrorMessage(
                `Could not read env file "${denoEnvPath}": ${error}`,
              );
            }
          }
        }
        const denoEnv = config.get<Record<string, string>>("env");
        if (denoEnv) {
          Object.assign(env, denoEnv); // Vulnerability: Unsafe merging of deno.env settings
        }
        const definition: tasks.DenoTaskDefinition = {
          type: tasks.TASK_TYPE,
          command: "upgrade",
          args,
          env, // Vulnerability: Passing unsanitized env to task definition
        };
        // ...
        const task = tasks.buildDenoTask(workspaceFolder, denoCommand, definition, "upgrade", args, ["$deno"]);
        const execution = await vscode.tasks.executeTask(task); // Vulnerability: Task execution with potentially malicious env
        ```
    - **`client\src\tasks.ts` - `buildDenoTask` function:**
        ```typescript
        export function buildDenoTask(
          target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
          process: string,
          definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
          name: string,
          args: string[],
          problemMatchers: string[],
        ): vscode.Task {
          const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
            process,
            args,
            definition,
          ); // Vulnerability: ProcessExecution directly uses definition.env

          return new vscode.Task(
            definition,
            target,
            name,
            TASK_SOURCE,
            exec,
            problemMatchers,
          );
        }
        ```
    - The code snippets show that the extension reads environment variables from `.envFile` and `deno.env` configuration, parses them, and directly uses them in `ProcessExecution` when creating and executing Deno tasks. This direct usage without sanitization leads to the command injection vulnerability.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new Deno project in VS Code.
    2. Create a file named `.env` in the project root with the following content:
        ```env
        MALICIOUS_ENV="; touch /tmp/pwned ;"
        ```
        (For Windows, use `; cmd.exe /c "echo pwned > %TEMP%\\pwned.txt" ;`)
    3. Ensure Deno extension is enabled for this workspace (`deno.enable": true` in workspace settings or `deno.json` in project root).
    4. Open a Deno file (e.g., `main.ts`).
    5. Open the VS Code Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run "Tasks: Run Task".
    6. Select any Deno task (e.g., "deno: run").
    7. Observe that after the task execution, a file named `pwned` is created in the `/tmp/` directory (or `pwned.txt` in `%TEMP%` on Windows), indicating successful command injection via the `MALICIOUS_ENV` environment variable.
    8. Alternatively, use `deno.env` in workspace settings. Add the following to your `settings.json` within the `.vscode` folder:
        ```json
        {
            "deno.enable": true,
            "deno.env": {
                "MALICIOUS_ENV": "; touch /tmp/pwned_settings ;"
            }
        }
        ```
        Repeat steps 4-7 and verify that `pwned_settings` file is created in `/tmp/`.

This test case demonstrates that a malicious user can achieve arbitrary code execution by crafting a Deno project with a malicious `.env` file or by exploiting workspace settings if they have write access to them.
