Okay, I understand the instructions. Please provide the list of vulnerabilities you want me to process. I will then filter and format them according to your specifications, ensuring that only valid, high-rank or critical vulnerabilities that are not due to developer misuse of project files, not just missing documentation, and not denial of service, are included in the final markdown output.

**Please provide the list of vulnerabilities so I can start.**

Once you provide the list, I will go through each vulnerability and apply the following steps for each:

1. **Analyze the vulnerability description:** Understand the nature of the vulnerability, its cause, and how it can be exploited.
2. **Check exclusion criteria:**
    * **Insecure code patterns by developers using PROJECT FILES:** Determine if the vulnerability is a result of developers misusing provided project files in an explicitly insecure way.
    * **Missing documentation only:** Check if the root cause is solely a lack of documentation for secure usage.
    * **Denial of service vulnerabilities:** Identify if the vulnerability primarily leads to denial of service.
3. **Check inclusion criteria:**
    * **Valid and not already mitigated:** Confirm if the vulnerability is still present in the application and hasn't been fixed.
    * **Vulnerability rank at least: high:** Verify if the vulnerability rank is "high" or "critical".
4. **If included:**  Keep the vulnerability information and format it in markdown as requested.
5. **If excluded:** Discard the vulnerability.

I'm ready to process the list as soon as you provide it.
