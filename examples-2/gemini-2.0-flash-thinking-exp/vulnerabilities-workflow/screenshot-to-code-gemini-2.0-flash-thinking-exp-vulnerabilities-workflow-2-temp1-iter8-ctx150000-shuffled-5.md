- Vulnerability Name: Uncontrolled Filename in Debug File Writer leading to potential Path Traversal and File Manipulation
- Description:
    1. The `DebugFileWriter` class in `backend\debug\DebugFileWriter.py` is used to write debug information to files within a directory.
    2. The base directory for debug logs is configured by `DEBUG_DIR` in `backend\config.py`.
    3. The subdirectory for each debug session is generated using `uuid.uuid4()`, which is safe.
    4. However, the filename for individual debug files is taken directly from the `filename` argument of the `write_to_file` method.
    5. If an attacker can control or influence the `filename` argument, they could potentially perform a path traversal attack by injecting path separators (e.g., `..\\`, `../`) into the filename.
    6. This could allow an attacker to write debug information to arbitrary locations within the server's filesystem that the backend process has write access to.
    7. While the content written to the file (`content` argument) is also attacker-controlled in the sense that it is derived from AI model responses which could be influenced by prompt manipulation (though not directly attacker input in this specific flow), the primary risk here is arbitrary file write location, not necessarily arbitrary content. However, writing arbitrary content to arbitrary location can be a vulnerability on its own.
- Impact:
    - **Medium to High**.
    - An attacker could potentially overwrite existing files or create new files in sensitive locations on the server, depending on the permissions of the user running the backend process.
    - While arbitrary code execution is not directly achieved, arbitrary file write can be a stepping stone for further attacks or lead to data corruption or information disclosure if sensitive files are targeted.
    - In a more severe scenario, if the web server is configured to serve static files from the directory where an attacker can write, this could lead to serving malicious content.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The debug directory is within `DEBUG_DIR`, which can be configured. However, this does not prevent path traversal within the system.
    - Debugging is only enabled if `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` is set to `True` in `config.py` or the environment variables. This reduces the attack surface in production if debugging is disabled.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: The `filename` argument in the `write_to_file` method should be validated and sanitized to prevent path traversal characters.
    - **Path Normalization**: Before writing the file, the filename should be normalized using `os.path.basename` to remove any leading directory components and ensure it's just a filename within the intended debug directory.
- Preconditions:
    - Debug mode (`IS_DEBUG_ENABLED=True`) must be enabled.
    - An attacker needs to find a way to influence the `filename` argument passed to the `DebugFileWriter.write_to_file` method. This is likely an indirect attack vector, possibly through manipulating AI model responses or other backend logic that uses debug logging.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    File: ..\screenshot-to-code\backend\debug\DebugFileWriter.py
    Content:
    ...
    class DebugFileWriter:
        ...
        def write_to_file(self, filename: str, content: str) -> None:
            try:
                with open(os.path.join(self.debug_artifacts_path, filename), "w") as file:
                    file.write(content)
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f"Failed to write to file: {e}")
    ...
    ```
    - In the `write_to_file` function, `filename` is directly used in `os.path.join(self.debug_artifacts_path, filename)` without any sanitization.
    - `self.debug_artifacts_path` is created using `os.makedirs` with `exist_ok=True`, which is safe.
    - The vulnerability arises from the unsanitized `filename` argument.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition**: Set `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED=True` in `backend\config.py` or environment variables.
    2. **Action**: Trigger a code generation request (e.g., upload a screenshot).
    3. **Observation**: Examine the backend logs and debug files. In normal operation, files should be created within the `DEBUG_DIR` (e.g., `run_debug`).
    4. **Exploit Attempt**: Modify the backend code (or find an injection point if possible in future development, current code doesn't directly allow external filename input) to call `DebugFileWriter.write_to_file` with a malicious filename like `"../../../tmp/evil.txt"` and arbitrary content like `"Malicious debug log"`.
    5. **Expected Outcome**: Without mitigation, a file named `evil.txt` should be created in the `/tmp/` directory of the server (or relative to the backend's working directory if path is relative and resolves outside of `DEBUG_DIR`).
    6. **Mitigation Test**: After implementing path sanitization (e.g., using `os.path.basename(filename)`), repeat step 4. The file should be created within the debug directory, and path traversal should be prevented. For example, if `DEBUG_DIR` is `./run_debug`, the file should be created as `./run_debug/../../../tmp/evil.txt` which after sanitization and join becomes `./run_debug/evil.txt` effectively preventing traversal.

- Vulnerability Name: Image Processing Library Vulnerabilities (Pillow)
- Description:
    1. The project uses the Pillow library (`pillow` package in `backend\pyproject.toml`) for image processing, specifically in `backend\image_processing\utils.py` and potentially in `backend\video\utils.py` via `PIL.Image`.
    2. Pillow, like any complex library, can have security vulnerabilities. If a vulnerable version of Pillow is used and if the application processes images without sufficient validation, an attacker could potentially upload a malicious image crafted to exploit these vulnerabilities.
    3. Exploiting Pillow vulnerabilities could potentially lead to various impacts including denial of service, information disclosure, or in more severe cases, arbitrary code execution on the server if a critical vulnerability is present in the Pillow version used and triggered by the image processing operations.
    4. The `process_image` function in `backend\image_processing\utils.py` performs operations like resizing and format conversion using Pillow which could be attack vectors if vulnerabilities exist in these Pillow functionalities.
- Impact:
    - **Medium to Critical**, depending on the specific Pillow vulnerability and exploitability.
    - A successful exploit could range from denial of service due to excessive resource consumption during malicious image processing to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium to High (depending on specific Pillow vulnerability)
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project specifies a relatively recent version of Pillow (`pillow = "^10.3.0"`) in `backend\pyproject.toml`. Using a recent version helps in mitigating known vulnerabilities present in older versions. However, this is not a complete mitigation as new vulnerabilities might be discovered in even the latest versions.
    - Image processing is performed to meet Claude API requirements (size and dimension limits). While not directly a security mitigation, this processing might inadvertently reduce the likelihood of triggering certain types of image-based attacks that rely on extremely large or malformed images.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**: Regularly scan project dependencies, including Pillow, for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools (e.g., `safety check` for Python projects). Update Pillow and other libraries promptly when vulnerabilities are identified and patches are available.
    - **Input Validation**: While the code processes images for Claude's requirements, more robust image validation could be implemented. This includes:
        - **File Type and Magic Number Validation**: Verify that the uploaded file type matches the expected image format and validate the file's magic number to prevent type confusion attacks (e.g., uploading a non-image file with an image extension). However, this might be complex with data URLs.
        - **Image Format Whitelisting**: Restrict the allowed image formats to a safe subset (e.g., PNG, JPEG) and reject other formats that might be more prone to vulnerabilities.
        - **Limit Image Processing Functionality**: Only use essential Pillow functionalities needed for the application and avoid using complex or less secure features if not strictly necessary.
    - **Resource Limits**: Implement resource limits (e.g., memory and CPU time limits) for image processing operations to mitigate potential denial-of-service attacks caused by processing maliciously crafted images that consume excessive resources.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker can upload an image to the backend. This is a standard functionality of the application.
    - A vulnerable version of Pillow is in use or a vulnerability exists in the current Pillow version that can be exploited through the image processing operations performed by the application.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    File: ..\screenshot-to-code\backend\image_processing\utils.py
    Content:
    ...
    from PIL import Image
    ...
    def process_image(image_data_url: str) -> tuple[str, str]:
        ...
        img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes))
        ...
        img = img.resize((new_width, new_height), Image.DEFAULT_STRATEGY)
        ...
        img = img.convert("RGB")
        img.save(output, format="JPEG", quality=quality)
        ...
    ```
    - The `process_image` function uses `Image.open()` to load the image, `img.resize()` for resizing, `img.convert("RGB")` for color mode conversion, and `img.save()` for saving in JPEG format. Each of these Pillow operations could potentially be vulnerable if a crafted image is processed.
    - Similarly, `backend\video\utils.py` uses `PIL.Image.fromarray()` to convert video frames to images, which also relies on Pillow and can be a potential vulnerability point.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition**: Set up the screenshot-to-code application locally or use a publicly available instance.
    2. **Action**: Prepare a malicious image file specifically crafted to exploit a known vulnerability in the Pillow library version used by the application. Publicly available resources like security vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases, Pillow security advisories) can be used to find known Pillow vulnerabilities and potentially craft such images or find existing examples. For example, research for known vulnerabilities related to `Image.open`, `img.resize`, or `img.save` in the Pillow version being used.
    3. **Exploit Attempt**: Upload this malicious image to the application via the front-end interface, triggering the backend image processing pipeline.
    4. **Observation**: Monitor the backend server for signs of exploitation. This could include:
        - **Denial of Service**: Backend process crashes, becomes unresponsive, or consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory).
        - **Information Disclosure**: Error messages revealing sensitive information, unexpected file access, or network activity.
        - **Arbitrary Code Execution**: In a more advanced scenario, attempt to gain shell access or observe unexpected system behavior indicative of code execution.
    5. **Expected Outcome**: If a vulnerability is successfully exploited, one of the above impacts should be observable. The severity depends on the specific vulnerability.
    6. **Mitigation Test**: After implementing mitigations like dependency vulnerability scanning and input validation (e.g., file type validation, format whitelisting, resource limits), repeat steps 2-5. The application should now handle the malicious image safely without exhibiting vulnerable behavior. Dependency updates will require manually checking and updating `pyproject.toml` and running `poetry update`. Input validation will require code modifications in `image_processing/utils.py` and potentially `video/utils.py` to add checks before Pillow operations.
