#### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability via AI-Generated Code

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious screenshot that visually represents HTML elements containing an XSS payload. For example, a screenshot might depict a text input field with the pre-filled value `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-test-1')>` or a seemingly innocuous text block that actually contains `<script>alert('XSS-test-2')</script>`.
    2. A user, intending to convert a design to code, uploads this malicious screenshot to the "screenshot-to-code" application.
    3. The backend AI model (Claude, GPT-4 Vision, etc.) processes the screenshot to generate HTML, CSS, and Javascript code.
    4. Due to the nature of Large Language Models and the project's design, the AI model may faithfully reproduce the visual content of the screenshot, including the malicious XSS payload, directly into the generated code.
    5. The application presents the generated code to the user without any security sanitization or validation.
    6. The user, unaware of the embedded XSS vulnerability, copies and integrates the AI-generated code into their own web project.
    7. When another user accesses the web project and the malicious AI-generated code is rendered by their browser, the Javascript XSS payload executes.

- **Impact:**
    - High. Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability can have severe consequences. An attacker could:
        - Steal sensitive user information (session cookies, credentials).
        - Perform actions on behalf of the victim user (account takeover).
        - Deface the web page or redirect users to malicious websites.
        - Inject malware or further malicious scripts into the user's browser.
        - Conduct phishing attacks.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None. The provided project files do not include any mechanisms to sanitize or validate the HTML, CSS, or Javascript code generated by the AI models to prevent XSS or other injection vulnerabilities. The system prompts (e.g., in `backend/prompts/screenshot_system_prompts.py` and `backend/prompts/claude_prompts.py`) focus on visual accuracy and code functionality, but lack any instructions or strategies for generating secure code or mitigating injection risks.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Output Sanitization:** Implement robust server-side sanitization of the AI-generated HTML code before presenting it to the user. This should involve using a security-focused HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify on the backend if using Node.js, or a Python equivalent if feasible, though backend is Python and frontend is JS) to parse the generated HTML and remove or escape potentially dangerous elements and attributes, particularly Javascript event handlers (`onload`, `onerror`, etc.), `<script>` tags, `<iframe>` tags, and potentially unsafe attributes like `href` in `<a>` tags if not strictly controlled.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) Guidance:** While the project cannot enforce CSP on the user's deployed application, the application could provide guidance and warnings about the importance of implementing a strong Content Security Policy in projects that incorporate AI-generated code. This should be part of security best practices documentation for users.
    - **User Awareness and Warnings:** Display prominent warnings within the "screenshot-to-code" application itself, informing users about the inherent security risks associated with using AI-generated code. Emphasize the necessity for manual security review and sanitization of the generated code before deploying it in a production environment. This warning should be presented clearly in the UI, perhaps next to the generated code output.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to create a visually convincing screenshot that incorporates a functional XSS payload within visual elements like text or input fields.
    - A user must upload this malicious screenshot and proceed to use the AI-generated code without conducting a thorough security review and sanitization process.

- **Source code analysis:**
    - **`backend/generate_code.py`:** This file handles the core logic for generating code from screenshots. It receives user input (screenshot), sends it to the chosen AI model via functions in `backend/llm.py`, and streams the generated code back to the frontend via WebSockets. Critically, there is no code in this file, or in the overall project, that performs any sanitization or security checks on the AI-generated output before it is presented to the user.
    - **`backend/llm.py`:** This module contains functions (`stream_openai_response`, `stream_claude_response`, `stream_gemini_response`) that interact with the AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini). These functions are responsible for sending the prompts (which are based on user screenshots) to the LLMs and streaming back the responses. The focus is on getting the AI to generate code based on the visual input, without any consideration for security implications of the generated code.
    - **`backend/codegen/utils.py`:** The `extract_html_content` function in this file is used to extract the HTML portion from the AI's response. However, this is purely for formatting purposes and does not involve any security-related processing. It does not sanitize or validate the extracted HTML in any way.
    - **`backend/prompts/*`:** The prompt files (`backend/prompts/screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `backend/prompts/claude_prompts.py`, `backend/prompts/imported_code_prompts.py`) define the instructions given to the AI models. These prompts are designed to guide the AI in generating visually accurate and functional code in various frameworks (HTML/CSS, React, Vue, etc.).  They do not contain any instructions to generate secure code or to avoid generating potentially vulnerable code constructs like XSS.

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Malicious Screenshot Creation:**
        - Use an image editor or a simple HTML page rendered as a screenshot to create an image.
        - Within the image, visually include a text element that contains the following XSS payload: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-test-Vulnerability-1')>`. Ensure this payload is visually rendered as text within the screenshot. Save the image as `malicious_screenshot_xss1.png`.
        - Create another malicious screenshot, `malicious_screenshot_xss2.png`, this time visually representing a text block containing: `<script>alert('XSS-test-Vulnerability-2')</script>`.

    2. **Upload and Code Generation (XSS Payload 1 - `<img>` tag):**
        - Open the "screenshot-to-code" application in a web browser (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
        - Select "Image" input mode and choose "HTML + Tailwind" stack (or any other HTML-based stack).
        - Upload `malicious_screenshot_xss1.png`.
        - Click the "Generate Code" button.
        - Once the code generation is complete, carefully examine the generated HTML code displayed in the application. Look for the presence of the injected XSS payload `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-test-Vulnerability-1')>` within the generated HTML, likely within a `<div>` or `<p>` tag that corresponds to the visual text element in the screenshot.

    3. **Execute and Verify XSS (XSS Payload 1 - `<img>` tag):**
        - Copy the generated HTML code from the application's output.
        - Create a new file named `xss_test_1.html` and paste the copied HTML code into it.
        - Open `xss_test_1.html` in a web browser.
        - Observe if an alert dialog box appears with the message "XSS-test-Vulnerability-1". If the alert appears, the XSS vulnerability is confirmed for the `<img>` tag payload.

    4. **Upload and Code Generation (XSS Payload 2 - `<script>` tag):**
        - Repeat step 2, but this time upload `malicious_screenshot_xss2.png`.

    5. **Execute and Verify XSS (XSS Payload 2 - `<script>` tag):**
        - Repeat step 3, but using the HTML code generated from `malicious_screenshot_xss2.png` and create a new file `xss_test_2.html`.
        - Open `xss_test_2.html` in a web browser.
        - Observe if an alert dialog box appears with the message "XSS-test-Vulnerability-2". If the alert appears, the XSS vulnerability is confirmed for the `<script>` tag payload.

    **Expected Result:** Both test cases (using `<img>` and `<script>` payloads in malicious screenshots) should result in the execution of the Javascript `alert()` function when the generated HTML is opened in a browser, thus proving the XSS vulnerability. This is expected because there is no output sanitization in the application.
