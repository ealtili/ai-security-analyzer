## Vulnerability list for vscode_deno

### No high-rank RCE, Command Injection, Code Injection vulnerabilities found

After a thorough analysis of the provided project files, no vulnerabilities of High or Critical rank, belonging to the classes of RCE, Command Injection, or Code Injection, were identified that are introduced by the project itself and can be triggered by a malicious repository.

The analysis focused on areas of the code that handle command execution, user input, and external resources, including:

- Debug configuration generation (`debug_config_provider.ts`)
- Task execution (`tasks.ts`, `tasks_sidebar.ts`, `commands.ts`)
- Test execution (`testing.ts`, `commands.ts`)
- Deno command path resolution (`client/src/util.ts`)
- Welcome panel and webview (`welcome.ts`, `media/welcome.js`)
- Extension settings and configurations

While user-configurable settings exist that could potentially be misused if a user were to intentionally configure them maliciously, these are not considered vulnerabilities introduced by the project itself, nor are they triggerable solely by providing a malicious repository without user intervention in settings.

The project appears to implement reasonable security practices for the areas examined, such as using CSP in webviews and constructing command arguments programmatically rather than directly executing user-provided strings.

Therefore, based on the provided PROJECT FILES and the specified criteria, no vulnerabilities meeting the requirements were found.
