### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Server-Side Image/Video Processing Vulnerability

* **Description:**
    1. An attacker uploads a maliciously crafted image or video file through the application's frontend.
    2. The frontend sends this file to the backend as a base64 encoded data URL via WebSocket.
    3. The backend, specifically in `backend\video\utils.py` for videos and `backend\image_processing\utils.py` for images, decodes the base64 data without proper validation of the file's content or type against expected formats (e.g., checking magic numbers or using a dedicated library for type detection).
    4. For video processing, `backend\video\utils.py` uses `moviepy.editor.VideoFileClip` to process the video file. For image processing, `backend\image_processing\utils.py` uses `PIL.Image.open` to open the image file.
    5. If the uploaded file is crafted to exploit vulnerabilities within `VideoFileClip` (MoviePy) or `Image.open` (Pillow), such as buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution, or other parsing vulnerabilities, the backend server could be compromised.
    6. Successful exploitation could lead to various impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the image/video processing libraries.

* **Impact:**
    - **High:**  Successful exploitation could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the backend server, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the server. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, service disruption, and further attacks on internal systems. Even if RCE is not achieved, other vulnerabilities like denial of service or file disclosure might be possible depending on the specific flaw in the libraries.

* **Vulnerability Rank:**
    - **High:** Due to the potential for Remote Code Execution.

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **None:** Based on the source code analysis, there is no explicit input validation performed on the uploaded image or video files before they are processed by Pillow or MoviePy. The code directly decodes and processes the data.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation:** Implement robust server-side validation for uploaded files:
        - **File Type Validation:** Verify the MIME type of the uploaded file against allowed types (e.g., `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `video/mp4`, `video/webm`).  Do not rely solely on client-side validation, as it can be easily bypassed. Use libraries that check file magic numbers, not just extensions.
        - **File Size Limits:** Enforce reasonable file size limits to prevent excessively large files from being processed, which could lead to resource exhaustion or buffer overflows.
        - **Content Security Checks:**  For images and videos, consider using security-focused libraries or functions within Pillow and MoviePy to sanitize or validate the file content before full processing. Investigate if these libraries offer features to mitigate known vulnerabilities or options for safer processing modes.
    - **Library Updates:** Regularly update Pillow and MoviePy libraries to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    - **Sandboxing/Isolation:**  Consider running the image/video processing in a sandboxed environment or isolated process to limit the impact of a potential exploit. If a vulnerability is exploited, the attacker's access would be contained within the sandbox, preventing full system compromise.

* **Preconditions:**
    - The application must be running and accessible to external users.
    - The attacker must be able to upload an image or video file to the application.
    - The backend must process the uploaded file using vulnerable image/video processing libraries (Pillow and MoviePy).

* **Source Code Analysis:**

    1. **`backend\video\utils.py` - `split_video_into_screenshots` function:**
    ```python
    def split_video_into_screenshots(video_data_url: str) -> list[Image.Image]:
        # ...
        # Decode the base64 URL to get the video bytes
        video_encoded_data = video_data_url.split(",")[1]
        video_bytes = base64.b64decode(video_encoded_data)

        mime_type = video_data_url.split(";")[0].split(":")[1]
        suffix = mimetypes.guess_extension(mime_type)

        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=suffix, delete=True) as temp_video_file:
            print(temp_video_file.name)
            temp_video_file.write(video_bytes)
            temp_video_file.flush()
            clip = VideoFileClip(temp_video_file.name) # Vulnerable line
            # ...
    ```
    - The code directly decodes the base64 video data and writes it to a temporary file.
    - `VideoFileClip(temp_video_file.name)` then processes this temporary file using MoviePy.
    - **No validation is performed on `video_data_url` or `video_bytes` to ensure it is a safe video file before processing.**

    2. **`backend\image_processing\utils.py` - `process_image` function:**
    ```python
    def process_image(image_data_url: str) -> tuple[str, str]:
        # ...
        # Extract bytes and media type from base64 data URL
        media_type = image_data_url.split(";")[0].split(":")[1]
        base64_data = image_data_url.split(",")[1]
        image_bytes = base64.b64decode(base64_data)

        img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes)) # Vulnerable line
        # ...
    ```
    - The code decodes the base64 image data and opens it directly using `PIL.Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes))`.
    - **No validation is performed on `image_data_url` or `image_bytes` to ensure it is a safe image file before processing.**

* **Security Test Case:**

    1. **Setup:**
        - Deploy the `screenshot-to-code` application to a test environment.
        - Ensure you have access to the application's frontend.
        - Prepare a malicious image file or video file known to exploit vulnerabilities in Pillow or MoviePy (or create a sample file for testing purposes, researching known vulnerability patterns if needed). You can search for "Pillow exploit samples" or "MoviePy exploit samples" online to find examples or guidance on crafting such files.
    2. **Exploit Attempt (Image):**
        - On the frontend, attempt to upload the malicious image file as a screenshot.
        - Select any stack and model to initiate the code generation process.
        - Monitor the backend server for any signs of exploitation, such as:
            - Unexpected errors or crashes.
            - Suspicious process creation.
            - Outbound network connections initiated from the backend server to unexpected destinations.
            - File system modifications in unexpected locations.
    3. **Exploit Attempt (Video):**
        - On the frontend, attempt to upload the malicious video file as a screen recording.
        - Select any stack and model (relevant for video processing, e.g., Claude models).
        - Monitor the backend server for the same signs of exploitation as in step 2.
    4. **Verification:**
        - If exploitation is successful, you might observe:
            - Remote code execution: Ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server (e.g., by setting up a reverse shell).
            - Denial of Service: The backend service becomes unresponsive or crashes.
            - Error logs indicating issues within Pillow or MoviePy during file processing.
    5. **Expected Result:**
        - A vulnerable application will exhibit signs of exploitation when processing the malicious image/video file. A secure application should either reject the malicious file during validation or process it safely without leading to server compromise.

    **Note:**  Creating and using malicious files for security testing should be done in a controlled, isolated environment with explicit permission. Exercise caution and ethical considerations when performing security testing. If you are unsure how to craft a malicious file or perform this test safely, consult with security experts. You might start by researching publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Pillow and MoviePy and try to trigger those.
