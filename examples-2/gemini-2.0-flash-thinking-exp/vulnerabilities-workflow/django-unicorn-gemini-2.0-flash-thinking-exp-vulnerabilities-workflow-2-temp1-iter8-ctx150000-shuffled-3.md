### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: XSS vulnerability through `safe` Meta option

* Description:
    1. A developer uses the `safe` Meta option in a Django Unicorn component to prevent HTML encoding for a specific field.
    2. User input from this field is rendered directly into the component template without further sanitization.
    3. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code as user input for this field.
    4. When the component re-renders (e.g., after an action), the injected JavaScript code is executed in the user's browser because the field is marked as `safe` and not HTML encoded.

* Impact: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * By default, Django Unicorn HTML encodes all updated field values to prevent XSS, as mentioned in `CHANGELOG.md` (v0.36.0) and `views.md`.
    * The documentation in `views.md` explicitly warns about the security implications of using the `safe` Meta option: "By default, `unicorn` HTML encodes updated field values to prevent XSS attacks. You need to explicitly opt-in to allow a field to be returned without being encoded by adding it to the `Meta` class's `safe` tuple."

* Missing Mitigations:
    * No explicit sanitization or escaping is performed on fields marked as `safe`. The developer is solely responsible for ensuring that data marked as `safe` is indeed safe to render without encoding.
    * No clear guidance or security best practices are provided in the documentation on when and how to use the `safe` Meta option securely, beyond the warning.

* Preconditions:
    1. A Django Unicorn component exists that renders user input.
    2. The component's `Meta` class includes a `safe` tuple that lists the field receiving user input.
    3. The developer has not implemented any additional input sanitization for this field.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `django_unicorn\views\views.py`
    2. Function: `_process_component_request`
    3. Line: Around line 235:
    ```python
    # Mark safe attributes as such before rendering
    for field_name in safe_fields:
        value = getattr(component, field_name)
        if isinstance(value, str):
            setattr(component, field_name, mark_safe(value))  # noqa: S308
    ```
    4. Analysis: This code block iterates through `safe_fields` (fields listed in `Meta.safe`). If a field's value is a string, it is marked as safe using `mark_safe` from `django.utils.safestring`. This means that when rendered in the template, Django will not automatically HTML-escape the content of these fields.
    5. File: `django_unicorn\templatetags\unicorn.py` and `django_unicorn\components\unicorn_template_response.py` are involved in template rendering, but the key logic for `safe` is in `django_unicorn\views\views.py`.
    6. Visualization: The vulnerability occurs when data flow is: User Input -> Component Field (marked as `safe`) -> Template Rendering -> Browser (JavaScript execution). No sanitization step is present for `safe` fields in the framework itself.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a Django Unicorn component that renders user input with the `safe` Meta option.
        ```python
        # example_xss.py
        from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

        class XSSView(UnicornView):
            user_input = ""

            class Meta:
                safe = ("user_input",)
        ```
        ```html
        <!-- example_xss.html -->
        <div>
          <input type="text" unicorn:model="user_input">
          <div id="output">Output: {{ user_input }}</div>
        </div>
        ```
    2. Create a Django view to render this component.
        ```python
        # views.py
        from django.shortcuts import render
        from example.unicorn.components.example_xss import XSSView

        def xss_test(request):
            return render(request, 'www/xss_test.html', {'component_name': 'example-xss'})
        ```
        ```html
        <!-- xss_test.html -->
        {% load unicorn %}
        <html>
        <head>
            {% unicorn_scripts %}
        </head>
        <body>
            {% unicorn 'example-xss' %}
        </body>
        </html>
        ```
    3. Configure URLs to access this view.
        ```python
        # urls.py
        from django.urls import path
        from www import views as www_views

        urlpatterns = [
            path("xss_test", www_views.xss_test, name="xss_test"),
            path("unicorn/", include("django_unicorn.urls")),
        ]
        ```
    4. Access the `xss_test` URL in a browser.
    5. In the input field, enter the following payload: `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability")</script>`.
    6. Observe that an alert box with "XSS Vulnerability" is displayed when the component re-renders, proving the XSS vulnerability because the input was treated as `safe` and rendered without sanitization.
