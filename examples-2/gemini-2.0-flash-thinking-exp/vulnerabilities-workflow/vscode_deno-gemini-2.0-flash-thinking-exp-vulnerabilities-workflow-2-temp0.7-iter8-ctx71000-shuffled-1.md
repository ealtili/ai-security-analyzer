- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Deno Path Configuration
- Description:
    1. An attacker tricks a user into configuring the `deno.path` setting in VS Code to point to a malicious executable instead of the legitimate Deno CLI. This can be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by compromising a user's settings synchronization.
    2. The user, unaware of the malicious configuration, continues to use the VS Code Deno extension as usual.
    3. When the extension needs to execute a Deno command, such as for formatting, linting, testing, caching, or any other feature that invokes the Deno CLI, it retrieves the executable path from the `deno.path` setting.
    4. Instead of executing the legitimate Deno CLI, the extension inadvertently executes the malicious executable specified in `deno.path`.
    5. The malicious executable then runs with the privileges of the VS Code process, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
- Impact:
    - Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
    - This can lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including:
        - Data theft and exfiltration.
        - Installation of malware, including ransomware, spyware, or viruses.
        - Complete compromise of the user's system and sensitive information.
        - Unauthorized access to local network resources.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension currently lacks any input validation or sanitization for the `deno.path` configuration. It directly uses the path provided by the user without verification.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `deno.path` configuration setting. While reliably validating if a given executable is the legitimate Deno CLI is challenging, some basic checks could be implemented:
        - Check if the executable path is within a standard installation directory (though this is platform-dependent and not foolproof).
        - Attempt to execute the executable with a `--version` flag and verify if the output resembles a valid Deno version string. This can be bypassed by a sophisticated attacker.
    - Enhanced documentation and user warnings:
        - Clearly document the security risks associated with modifying the `deno.path` setting.
        - Warn users against setting `deno.path` to executables from untrusted sources or locations.
        - Consider displaying a warning message within VS Code when the `deno.path` setting is modified, advising users to exercise caution.
    - Explore alternative approaches to execute Deno CLI:
        - Investigate if there are secure methods to bundle or manage the Deno CLI within the extension itself, reducing reliance on user-provided paths. This might be complex and increase extension size.
- Preconditions:
    - The VS Code Deno extension must be installed and active.
    - The user must be tricked into modifying the `deno.path` setting in VS Code to point to a malicious executable.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `client/src/util.ts`
        - Function: `getDenoCommandPath()`
            ```typescript
            export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
              const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath(); // Retrieves deno.path from configuration
              const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
              if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
                return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
              } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
                // if sent a relative path, iterate over workspace folders to try and resolve.
                for (const workspace of workspaceFolders) {
                  const commandPath = path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command);
                  if (await fileExists(commandPath)) { // Checks if file exists, but not if it's legitimate
                    return commandPath;
                  }
                }
                return undefined;
              } else {
                return command; // Returns user-provided path without validation
              }
            }
            ```
        - The code retrieves the `deno.path` setting using `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`.
        - It attempts to resolve relative paths and checks for file existence using `fileExists()`.
        - **Vulnerability:** The crucial point is that the function returns the user-provided path without any validation to ensure it is a legitimate Deno executable. It only checks if a file exists at the given path.

    - File: `client/src/util.ts`
        - Function: `getDenoCommandName()`
            ```typescript
            export async function getDenoCommandName() {
              return await getDenoCommandPath() ?? "deno"; // Defaults to "deno" if path not found
            }
            ```
        - This function calls `getDenoCommandPath()` to get the path and defaults to "deno" if no path is configured or found.

    - Files: `client/src/tasks.ts`, `client/src/debug_config_provider.ts`, `client/src/upgrade.ts`, `client/src/commands.ts`
        - These files utilize `getDenoCommandName()` or `getDenoCommandPath()` to obtain the Deno command executable path.
        - The obtained path is then used to create `vscode.ProcessExecution` instances, which directly execute the command without further validation.

    - Visualization:
        ```

        ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare Malicious Executable:**
        - Create a file named `malicious-deno.sh` (or `malicious-deno.bat` on Windows) with the following content:
            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "Malicious Deno Executable is running!"
            mkdir /tmp/vscode-deno-exploit # Example malicious action: create a directory
            if [ "$1" == "lsp" ]; then # Simulate Deno LSP if needed for extension to function
                echo "Simulating Deno LSP output..."
                sleep 1
            elif [ "$1" == "fmt" ]; then # Simulate Deno format
                echo "Simulating Deno fmt output..."
                sleep 1
            elif [ "$1" == "test" ]; then # Simulate Deno test
                echo "Simulating Deno test output..."
                sleep 1
            else
                /usr/bin/env deno "$@" # Forward other commands to real deno if needed for less disruptive testing, comment out for full malicious test
            fi
            ```
            (On Windows, create `malicious-deno.bat` with similar commands using batch syntax, e.g., `echo Malicious Deno Executable is running!`, `mkdir %TEMP%\vscode-deno-exploit`)
        - Make the script executable: `chmod +x malicious-deno.sh`

    2. **Configure `deno.path` in VS Code:**
        - Open VS Code settings (File > Preferences > Settings > Settings or Code > Settings > Settings).
        - Search for "deno.path".
        - In the `Deno › Path` setting, enter the absolute path to your `malicious-deno.sh` script (e.g., `/path/to/malicious-deno.sh`).

    3. **Trigger Extension Functionality:**
        - Open any TypeScript or JavaScript file in VS Code.
        - Ensure Deno is enabled for the workspace (you might need to run "Deno: Enable" command).
        - Trigger a Deno command. For example:
            - Format the document (Right-click in the editor > Format Document With... > Deno).
            - Run a test if you have test code lens enabled and visible.
            - Use "Deno: Cache" command from command palette.

    4. **Verify Exploitation:**
        - Check if the malicious code was executed. In this example, check if the directory `/tmp/vscode-deno-exploit` (or `%TEMP%\vscode-deno-exploit` on Windows) was created.
        - Observe the output in the VS Code Output panel (View > Output > Deno Language Server). You should see "Malicious Deno Executable is running!" printed, confirming that your malicious script was executed instead of the real Deno CLI.

    5. **Expected Result:**
        - The malicious executable should be successfully executed by the VS Code Deno extension when a Deno command is triggered, demonstrating arbitrary code execution. The `/tmp/vscode-deno-exploit` directory (or equivalent) should be created.
