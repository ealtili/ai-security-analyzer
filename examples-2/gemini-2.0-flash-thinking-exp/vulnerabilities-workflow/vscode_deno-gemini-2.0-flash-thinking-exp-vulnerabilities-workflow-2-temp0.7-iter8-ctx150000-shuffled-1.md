### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Import Map Arbitrary Code Execution
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious `importMap` file that redirects module imports to attacker-controlled code.
    2. The attacker tricks a user into configuring the "deno.importMap" setting in the VS Code Deno extension to point to this malicious `importMap` file. This can be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by compromising a project's workspace settings.
    3. The user opens a Deno project in VS Code with the Deno extension enabled.
    4. When the Deno Language Server initializes for the project, it reads the "deno.importMap" setting and uses the specified malicious `importMap` file for module resolution.
    5. When the user opens or interacts with Deno files in the project, the Deno Language Server attempts to resolve module imports based on the malicious `importMap`.
    6. Due to the redirection in the `importMap`, import statements like `import * as module from "some_module"` will now load code from the attacker's malicious module instead of the intended module.
    7. When the Deno Language Server processes these imports (e.g., during type checking, code completion, or other language features), the attacker's code from the malicious module gets loaded and executed within the VS Code environment.
    8. This allows the attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution within the user's VS Code environment.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.
    - Potential for data theft, installation of malware, or further system compromise.
    - Full control over the user's VS Code environment, allowing actions like modifying files, exfiltrating secrets, or controlling the editor's behavior.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension currently lacks specific mitigations for this vulnerability. It relies on the user to configure settings responsibly and to trust the source of the `importMap` file.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: The extension should validate the `deno.importMap` setting to ensure it points to a valid and safe file path. This could include checks to prevent specifying remote URLs or paths outside the workspace. However, even local paths can be malicious if the attacker can influence the user's file system.
    - User warning: Display a prominent warning message to the user when an `importMap` setting is configured, especially if it points to a file outside the current workspace or to a remote URL. This warning should highlight the security risks of using untrusted `importMap` files.
    - Sandboxing/Isolation: While more complex, consider sandboxing or isolating the Deno Language Server process to limit the potential damage from arbitrary code execution. This would be a more robust mitigation but might have performance and compatibility implications.
- Preconditions:
    - The user has the VS Code Deno extension installed and enabled.
    - The attacker can trick the user into setting a malicious file path in the "deno.importMap" setting in VS Code. This could be through social engineering, phishing, or by compromising a project's configuration files.
    - The user opens a Deno project in VS Code after configuring the malicious `importMap` setting.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability does not stem from a specific flaw in the extension's code but rather from the inherent risk of allowing user-specified paths for `importMap` without proper validation or security considerations.
    - In `client/src/extension.ts`, the `initializationOptions` function reads the `deno.importMap` setting from the VS Code workspace configuration:
      ```typescript
      initializationOptions: () => {
        const denoConfiguration = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get(
          EXTENSION_NS,
        ) as Record<string, unknown>;
        commands.transformDenoConfiguration(extensionContext, denoConfiguration);
        return {
          ...denoConfiguration,
          javascript: vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get("javascript"),
          typescript: vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get("typescript"),
          enableBuiltinCommands: true,
        } as object;
      },
      ```
    - This `denoConfiguration` object, including the `importMap` setting, is then passed as initialization options to the Deno Language Server when the client is created:
      ```typescript
      const client = new LanguageClient(
        LANGUAGE_CLIENT_ID,
        LANGUAGE_CLIENT_NAME,
        serverOptions,
        {
          outputChannel: extensionContext.outputChannel,
          middleware: { ... },
          ...extensionContext.clientOptions, // includes initializationOptions
        },
      );
      ```
    - The extension code itself does not perform any validation or sanitization of the `deno.importMap` path. It directly passes the user-provided path to the Deno Language Server.
    - The Deno Language Server (part of the Deno CLI) then trusts and uses this `importMap` for module resolution, leading to the potential for malicious code injection if a malicious `importMap` is provided.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Files:**
        - Create a file named `malicious_import_map.json` with the following content:
          ```json
          {
            "imports": {
              "insecure_module": "file:///tmp/malicious_code.js"
            }
          }
          ```
          (Note: Adjust `/tmp/malicious_code.js` to a writable path on your system if `/tmp` is not suitable).
        - Create a file named `malicious_code.js` at `/tmp/malicious_code.js` (or the path you used above) with the following content:
          ```javascript
          // malicious_code.js
          console.log("Malicious code executed from import_map!");
          // Simulate malicious activity - for testing, a simple exit is sufficient.
          if (typeof process !== 'undefined') { // Check if 'process' is available (Node.js API in Deno)
              process.exit(1); // Terminate VS Code process as an example.
          } else {
              // Fallback if 'process' is not available (unlikely in this context but for robustness)
              throw new Error("Malicious code execution proof");
          }
          ```
          Ensure `malicious_code.js` is placed at the path specified in `malicious_import_map.json`.
    2. **Configure VS Code Deno Extension:**
        - Open VS Code.
        - Open Settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Code > Settings > Settings on macOS).
        - Search for "deno.importMap".
        - In the "Deno â€º Config: Import Map" setting, enter the absolute path to the `malicious_import_map.json` file you created (e.g., `/path/to/malicious_import_map.json`).
    3. **Create a Deno Project:**
        - Create a new folder for a Deno project or open an existing one.
        - Create a new TypeScript file, e.g., `test_vuln.ts`, with the following content:
          ```typescript
          import * as insecure from "insecure_module";

          console.log("After potentially malicious import.");
          ```
    4. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Open the `test_vuln.ts` file in the VS Code editor.
    5. **Observe the Impact:**
        - **Expected Outcome:**
            - You should see "Malicious code executed from import_map!" printed in the output or console of VS Code, indicating that the code from `malicious_code.js` was executed.
            - If `process.exit(1)` in `malicious_code.js` is executed successfully, VS Code might unexpectedly terminate or reload, demonstrating a significant impact.
        - **Verification:**
            - If you do not see the "Malicious code executed from import_map!" message and VS Code does not terminate, the test case might not be set up correctly, or the vulnerability may not be triggered as expected in your environment. Double-check the file paths and configurations.
    6. **Cleanup (Important):**
        - After testing, **immediately remove** the malicious `deno.importMap` setting from your VS Code settings to prevent unintended consequences in your development environment.
        - Delete the `malicious_import_map.json` and `malicious_code.js` files if they are no longer needed.

This test case demonstrates how a malicious `importMap` can be used to inject and execute arbitrary code when a Deno project is opened in VS Code with the Deno extension, confirming the vulnerability.
