### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Deno Path Configuration
- Description:
    1. An attacker gains access to the VS Code settings (either user or workspace settings).
    2. The attacker modifies the `deno.path` setting to point to a malicious executable instead of the legitimate Deno CLI executable.
    3. The attacker triggers any functionality within the VS Code Deno extension that relies on executing the Deno CLI. This could be formatting a document, running tests via code lens, caching dependencies, or initiating a Deno upgrade.
    4. Instead of executing the legitimate Deno CLI, the extension executes the malicious executable specified in the `deno.path` setting.
    5. The malicious executable performs arbitrary actions on the user's system with the privileges of the user running VS Code.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This can lead to data theft, malware installation, system compromise, and other malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension does not validate or sanitize the `deno.path` setting. It trusts the user-provided path.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation for `deno.path`: The extension should validate the `deno.path` setting to ensure it points to a legitimate Deno executable. This could include:
        - Checking if the path is an executable file.
        - Verifying the file extension (e.g., `.exe` on Windows, no extension on Linux/macOS).
        - Potentially checking the file signature or hash against known Deno CLI signatures (though this might be complex to maintain).
        - Displaying a warning message when `deno.path` is explicitly configured, advising users to only use trusted paths.
    - Documentation: While not a code mitigation, clearly documenting the security risk associated with modifying the `deno.path` setting is crucial. The documentation should warn users against pointing `deno.path` to untrusted or unknown executables.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to modify VS Code settings (user or workspace). This could be achieved through:
        - Local access to the user's machine.
        - Social engineering to trick the user into changing the setting.
        - Exploiting another vulnerability that allows settings modification.
    - The Deno VS Code extension must be active and enabled in the workspace.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`client\src\util.ts`**:
        - The function `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` reads the `deno.path` setting directly from the VS Code configuration:
          ```typescript
          function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
            const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)
              .get<string>("path");
            // it is possible for the path to be blank. In that case, return undefined
            if (typeof exePath === "string" && exePath.trim().length === 0) {
              return undefined;
            } else {
              return exePath;
            }
          }
          ```
          - This function retrieves the string value of `deno.path` without any validation.
        - The function `getDenoCommandPath()` uses `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` to get the configured path:
          ```typescript
          export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
            const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
            const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
            if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
              return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
            } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
              // ... relative path resolution ...
            } else {
              return command;
            }
          }
          ```
          - If `deno.path` is set and is an absolute path, it's directly returned without validation.
        - The function `getDenoCommandName()` ultimately returns the resolved path or "deno" if not found:
          ```typescript
          export async function getDenoCommandName() {
            return await getDenoCommandPath() ?? "deno";
          }
          ```
    2. **`client\src\tasks.ts`**, **`client\src\debug_config_provider.ts`**, **`client\src\upgrade.ts`**:
        - These files import `getDenoCommandName` from `client\src\util.ts` and use it as the `command` in `vscode.ProcessExecution`. For example, in `client\src\tasks.ts`:
          ```typescript
          export function buildDenoTask(
            target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
            process: string, // process is the result of getDenoCommandName()
            definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
            name: string,
            args: string[],
            problemMatchers: string[],
          ): vscode.Task {
            const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
              process, // Used directly as the executable
              args,
              definition,
            );
            // ...
          }
          ```
        - Similarly, `DenoDebugConfigurationProvider` in `client\src\debug_config_provider.ts` uses `await getDenoCommandName()` for `runtimeExecutable`.
        - `denoUpgradePromptAndExecute` in `client\src\upgrade.ts` also uses `await getDenoCommandName()` to get the command for the upgrade task.

    **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        subgraph VS Code Extension
            getConfiguration --> getDenoCommandPath
            getDenoCommandPath --> getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath
            getDenoCommandPath --> getDefaultDenoCommand
            getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath --> deno.path setting
            ProcessExecution --> getDenoCommandName
        end
        subgraph VS Code Settings
            deno.path setting --> User Input (Malicious Executable Path)
        end
        ProcessExecution --> Malicious Executable
    ```

    **Explanation:** The diagram shows that the `deno.path` setting from VS Code settings directly influences the `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath` function. This path is then used by `getDenoCommandPath` and `getDenoCommandName` to determine the executable for `ProcessExecution`.  Since there is no validation on the `deno.path` setting, a malicious path provided by the user is directly used in `ProcessExecution`, leading to the execution of the malicious executable.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Preparation:**
        - Create a simple malicious script file named `malicious.bat` (for Windows) or `malicious.sh` (for Linux/macOS) in a known directory (e.g., your user's home directory).
        - `malicious.bat` (Windows):
          ```bat
          @echo off
          echo Malicious script executed! > malicious_execution.log
          ```
        - `malicious.sh` (Linux/macOS):
          ```sh
          #!/bin/bash
          echo "Malicious script executed!" > malicious_execution.log
          ```
          Make sure to make `malicious.sh` executable: `chmod +x malicious.sh`
        - Open VS Code with a workspace where the Deno extension is activated.
    2. **Configuration:**
        - Open VS Code settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings).
        - Search for `deno.path`.
        - Edit the `Deno â€º Path` setting and set it to the absolute path of your malicious script:
            - Windows:  `C:\path\to\your\home\directory\malicious.bat`
            - Linux/macOS: `/home/yourusername/malicious.sh` (replace `/home/yourusername` with your actual home directory path).
    3. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Open a TypeScript or JavaScript file in the workspace.
        - Trigger a Deno extension command that executes Deno CLI. For example:
            - Right-click in the editor and select "Format Document With..." -> "Deno".
            - Or, use the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and run "Deno: Cache".
    4. **Verification:**
        - Check if the `malicious_execution.log` file has been created in your home directory (or the directory where you placed the malicious script).
        - If the log file exists and contains "Malicious script executed!", it confirms that the malicious script was executed instead of the Deno CLI, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.

This test case proves that by manipulating the `deno.path` setting, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution when the VS Code Deno extension attempts to invoke the Deno CLI.
