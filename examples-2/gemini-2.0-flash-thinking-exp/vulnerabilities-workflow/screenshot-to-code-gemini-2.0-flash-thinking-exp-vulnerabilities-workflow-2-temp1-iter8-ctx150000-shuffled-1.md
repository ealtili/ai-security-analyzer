#### 1. Client-Side XSS in AI-Generated Code

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious screenshot or video. This crafted input is designed to subtly influence the AI model during code generation.
    2. The attacker uploads this crafted screenshot or video to the "screenshot-to-code" application through the user interface.
    3. The application's backend processes the image or video using an AI model to generate frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
    4. Due to the lack of input sanitization or output encoding, the AI model might unintentionally incorporate malicious code (e.g., JavaScript for XSS) from the crafted screenshot into the generated frontend code.
    5. The application returns the AI-generated code to the user.
    6. A user unknowingly copies and uses this AI-generated code in their web project.
    7. When a victim visits the user's project and the generated code is executed in their browser, the malicious JavaScript (injected via the crafted screenshot) also executes.
    8. This execution of malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser within the user's project constitutes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful XSS attacks can have severe consequences. An attacker could:
        - Steal sensitive user information, such as session cookies, which can lead to account hijacking.
        - Redirect users to malicious websites, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware infections.
        - Deface the web page, altering its content to mislead or harm users.
        - Perform actions on behalf of the user, such as making unauthorized transactions or accessing private data.
        - Injected JavaScript could be used to perform more advanced attacks depending on the context of the application where the generated code is deployed.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. Based on the source code analysis, there is no evidence of input sanitization of the screenshot content, nor output sanitization of the AI-generated code within the application to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. The `extract_html_content` function in `backend\codegen\utils.py` merely extracts HTML content using regular expressions without any sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Output Sanitization:** Implement robust HTML sanitization on the backend before sending the generated code to the frontend, or on the frontend before the user can copy the code. Use a well-vetted HTML sanitization library like DOMPurify (frontend - Javascript) or bleach (backend - Python). This sanitization should remove or encode any potentially malicious HTML elements and attributes, especially JavaScript event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`, `onclick`, `onmouseover`) and `javascript:` URLs.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While this project generates standalone HTML snippets, consider recommending or providing guidance on implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) when users integrate the generated code into larger web applications. CSP can significantly reduce the risk and impact of XSS attacks by controlling the resources the browser is allowed to load.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to craft a screenshot or video that can influence the AI model to generate code containing a client-side script. This might require some trial and error to understand how the AI model interprets visual inputs and translates them into code.
    - The user of the "screenshot-to-code" application must unknowingly use the generated, vulnerable code in a web project that is accessible to potential victims.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `backend\codegen\utils.py`
        ```python
        import re

        def extract_html_content(text: str):
            # Use regex to find content within <html> tags and include the tags themselves
            match = re.search(r"(<html.*?>.*?</html>)", text, re.DOTALL)
            if match:
                return match.group(1)
            else:
                # Otherwise, we just send the previous HTML over
                print(
                    "[HTML Extraction] No <html> tags found in the generated content: " + text
                )
                return text
        ```
        - The `extract_html_content` function uses a simple regular expression `r"(<html.*?>.*?</html>)"` to extract content within `<html>` tags from the AI model's text response.
        - This function **does not perform any HTML sanitization or encoding.** It directly returns the matched HTML string.
        - If the AI model, influenced by a malicious screenshot, generates HTML code that includes JavaScript (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` or event handlers like `<img src='#' onerror='alert(\"XSS\")'>`), this function will extract and return this malicious code without modification.

    - **File:** `backend\routes\generate_code.py`
        ```python
        # ...
        completions = [extract_html_content(completion) for completion in completions]
        # ...
        for index, updated_html in enumerate(updated_completions):
            await send_message("setCode", updated_html, index)
        # ...
        ```
        - The `stream_code` function in `backend\routes\generate_code.py` calls `extract_html_content` on the raw completion from the AI model.
        - The extracted HTML (`updated_html`) is then directly sent to the frontend via WebSocket using `send_message("setCode", updated_html, index)`.
        - The frontend then likely renders or allows the user to copy this unsanitized HTML code.

    - **Visualization:**

    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Craft a Malicious Screenshot:** Create a simple image (e.g., a white background) and embed the following HTML/JavaScript code within the image using a text editor or image manipulation tool. The goal is for the OCR and AI to "see" this text as part of the screenshot's content:
        ```html
        <img src="nonexistent-image.jpg" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')">
        ```
        Alternatively, try simpler payloads like just the text `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` within the screenshot.

    2. **Upload Screenshot and Generate Code:**
        - Access the publicly hosted version or a locally running instance of the "screenshot-to-code" application (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
        - In the application UI, upload the crafted screenshot.
        - Select any supported stack (e.g., "HTML + Tailwind").
        - Click the "Generate Code" button.

    3. **Inspect Generated Code:**
        - Once the code generation is complete, carefully examine the generated HTML code in the application's output panel.
        - Look for the injected XSS payload: `<img src="nonexistent-image.jpg" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')">` or `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. The AI model might slightly alter the payload, but the core malicious intent should be preserved if the vulnerability exists.

    4. **Execute Vulnerable Code:**
        - Copy the generated HTML code from the application.
        - Create a new HTML file (e.g., `xss_test.html`) on your local machine and paste the copied code into it.
        - Open `xss_test.html` in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).

    5. **Verify XSS Execution:**
        - If the application is vulnerable, you should see an alert dialog box pop up in your browser window with the message "XSS Vulnerability!". This confirms that the JavaScript code injected through the crafted screenshot has been successfully executed, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.
        - If using the `<img onerror>` payload, ensure that the alert triggers when the browser attempts to load the nonexistent image and encounters an error, thus executing the `onerror` event handler.

This security test case will validate whether a crafted screenshot can indeed lead to the AI model generating code susceptible to client-side XSS, due to the lack of output sanitization in the "screenshot-to-code" application.
