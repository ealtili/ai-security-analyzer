## Vulnerability List for django-unicorn Project

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Component Method Invocation

- Description:
    - An attacker can trigger arbitrary methods on a django-unicorn component by crafting a malicious `callMethod` action in the `action_queue` of a POST request to the `/message/` endpoint.
    - Step 1: Identify a publicly accessible django-unicorn component in the application.
    - Step 2: Analyze the component's Python code to identify available methods (excluding private methods starting with '_').
    - Step 3: Craft a POST request to the `/message/` endpoint targeting the identified component.
    - Step 4: In the request body, within the `action_queue`, create a `callMethod` action.
    - Step 5: Set the `payload.name` in the `callMethod` action to the name of the method to be invoked on the component.
    - Step 6: Send the crafted POST request to the server.
    - Step 7: Observe the server's response and component's state to confirm if the targeted method was executed.

- Impact:
    - Depending on the methods available in the component, successful exploitation could lead to:
        - Unintended modifications of component state, potentially altering application behavior.
        - Execution of component logic in ways not intended by the developers, possibly bypassing security checks.
        - Information disclosure if methods are designed to return sensitive data.
        - In some scenarios, it might be chained with other vulnerabilities to escalate impact.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Method Existence Check:** The `_call_method_name` function in `django_unicorn/views/action_parsers/call_method.py` checks if the method name provided in the request exists as an attribute of the component using `hasattr(component, method_name)`. This prevents calling arbitrary Python functions that are not explicitly defined as methods within the component class.
    - **Argument Parsing:** The framework uses `parse_call_method_name` to parse the method name and arguments, and `eval_value` with `ast.literal_eval` to evaluate the arguments. This adds a layer of input validation and type casting, reducing the risk of direct code injection through method arguments.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Method Allowlist/Denylist:** Currently, any public method on a component can be potentially invoked. Implementing a configuration-based allowlist of methods that are safe to be called from the frontend, or a denylist of sensitive methods that should never be callable remotely, would significantly reduce the attack surface.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization within Methods:** While argument parsing exists, it's crucial to enforce strict input validation and sanitization *within* each component method that is intended to be called from the frontend. This is the responsibility of the component developer, but framework-level guidance or utilities could encourage secure coding practices.
    - **Rate Limiting and Abuse Detection:** To mitigate potential abuse through automated method calling attacks, implementing rate limiting on the `/message/` endpoint and anomaly detection for unusual method invocation patterns could be beneficial.

- Preconditions:
    - The application must be running with django-unicorn enabled and publicly accessible.
    - The target component must have at least one public method that can be called via the frontend.
    - The attacker needs to know or guess the name of a public method in the component.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File:** `django_unicorn\views\action_parsers\call_method.py`
    - **Function:** `_call_method_name(component: UnicornView, method_name: str, args: Tuple[Any], kwargs: Dict[str, Any])`
    ```python
    def _call_method_name(component: UnicornView, method_name: str, args: Tuple[Any], kwargs: Dict[str, Any]) -> Any:
        """ ... """
        if method_name is not None and hasattr(component, method_name): # [1] Check if method exists
            func = getattr(component, method_name) # [2] Get method
            # ... argument parsing and casting ...
            if parsed_args:
                return func(*parsed_args, **parsed_kwargs) # [3] Call method with parsed args
            elif parsed_kwargs:
                return func(**parsed_kwargs) # [4] Call method with parsed kwargs
            else:
                return func() # [5] Call method without args
        return None # Implicit return if method doesn't exist
    ```
    - **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[POST /message/] --> B(handle in call_method.py)
        B --> C{Extract call_method_name from payload}
        C --> D(parse_call_method_name)
        D --> E(_call_method_name)
        E --> F{hasattr(component, method_name)?}
        F -- Yes --> G(getattr(component, method_name))
        G --> H{Parse Arguments and Kwargs}
        H --> I{func(*parsed_args, **parsed_kwargs) or func()}
        F -- No --> J[Return None]
        I --> J
    ```

    - **Step-by-step Explanation:**
        1. When a POST request with a `callMethod` action is sent to the `/message/` endpoint, the `handle` function in `call_method.py` is invoked.
        2. The `handle` function extracts the `call_method_name` from the request payload.
        3. The `parse_call_method_name` function parses this string to separate the method name from arguments and keyword arguments.
        4. The core logic resides in `_call_method_name`. It first checks if a method with the given `method_name` exists on the component instance using `hasattr()` **[1]**.
        5. If the method exists, it retrieves the method using `getattr()` **[2]**.
        6.  Arguments and keyword arguments are parsed and type-casted (although not visualized in detail here for brevity but present in code).
        7. Finally, the retrieved method (`func`) is invoked using `func(*parsed_args, **parsed_kwargs)` or `func()` depending on the presence of arguments **[3, 4, 5]**.
        8. If `hasattr()` check fails (method doesn't exist), the function implicitly returns `None` and the method is not called.

- Security Test Case:
    - **Step 1: Create Test Component:**
        - Create a new Unicorn component (e.g., `test_vuln_component.py`) with the following code:
        ```python
        from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

        class TestVulnView(UnicornView):
            vulnerable_property = "initial value"

            def sensitive_method(self, new_value):
                """This method is intended to be private, but is callable."""
                self.vulnerable_property = new_value

            def check_property(self):
                """This method is intended to be public to check the property."""
                return self.vulnerable_property
        ```
        - Create a template for this component (e.g., `unicorn/test-vuln-component.html`):
        ```html
        <div>
            <p id="property-value">{{ component.vulnerable_property }}</p>
            <button unicorn:click="sensitive_method('modified value')" id="intended-button">Intended Action</button>
        </div>
        ```
    - **Step 2: Include Component in a View:**
        - Include the `TestVulnView` component in a Django template that is accessible in your test application.
    - **Step 3: Craft Malicious POST Request:**
        - Use `curl`, `Postman`, or browser's developer tools to send a POST request to the `/message/` endpoint.
        - Request URL: `/message/unicorn.components.test_vuln_component.TestVulnView`
        - Request Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
        - Request Body (JSON):
        ```json
        {
            "id": "testComponentId",
            "name": "unicorn.components.test_vuln_component.TestVulnView",
            "epoch": 1678886400,
            "data": {},
            "checksum": "xxxx",  // Placeholder, checksum will be calculated if needed but ignored in this test.
            "actionQueue": [
                {
                    "type": "callMethod",
                    "payload": {
                        "name": "sensitive_method('attacker controlled value')"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
        *(Note: Checksum can be a placeholder for this test as we are focusing on method invocation. In a real attack, a valid checksum would be required or the request might be rejected)*

    - **Step 4: Send Request and Verify:**
        - Send the POST request.
        - After sending the request, access the page where the `TestVulnView` component is rendered.
        - Check the value of the `vulnerable_property` (e.g., by inspecting the element with `id="property-value"` in browser's developer tools or by adding a method like `check_property` to the component and calling it via another `callMethod` action).
        - **Expected Outcome:** If the vulnerability is present, the `vulnerable_property` value should be changed to `'attacker controlled value'`, even though the method `sensitive_method` was intended to be used internally or through specific UI interactions (like the button click in this example), not directly via user-controlled `callMethod` action names.
        - **Mitigation Check:** If a method allowlist/denylist or similar mitigation was implemented, this test should fail to modify the `vulnerable_property` via direct `callMethod` invocation of `sensitive_method`, unless `sensitive_method` was explicitly allowed.
