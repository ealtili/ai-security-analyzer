- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious screenshot containing text or visual elements designed to be interpreted by the AI as instructions to generate JavaScript code. For example, the screenshot could contain text that resembles HTML tags with embedded JavaScript events or script tags.
    2. The user uploads this malicious screenshot to the application.
    3. The backend AI model processes the screenshot and, due to the manipulated input, generates HTML code containing malicious JavaScript. This JavaScript could be directly embedded within HTML tags (e.g., `<img src="x" onerror="malicious_code()">`) or within `<script>` tags.
    4. The application returns the AI-generated code to the user.
    5. A user, intending to use the generated frontend code, copies and pastes this code into their own web project.
    6. When a user of the victim's project views the page containing the pasted AI-generated code, the malicious JavaScript executes in their browser, leading to XSS. This could result in session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks within the context of the victim's project.

- Impact:
    - Successful XSS exploitation in a user's project can lead to:
        - Account hijacking: Attacker can steal session cookies and impersonate the user.
        - Data theft: Access to sensitive information within the user's project.
        - Malware distribution: Redirect users to malicious websites or inject malware.
        - Defacement: Modify the content of the user's web page.
        - Full control of the user's application frontend depending on the nature of the malicious JavaScript injected.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project does not implement any sanitization or Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS in the generated code. The AI models are instructed to generate functional code, which inherently includes JavaScript and HTML that can be exploited if the input is manipulated.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization on the backend to analyze screenshots and remove or neutralize any potentially malicious code injection attempts before feeding the information to the AI model. This could involve techniques to identify and remove HTML tags or JavaScript-like syntax from the text extracted from the screenshot.
    - Output Sanitization/Encoding: Sanitize or encode the AI-generated code on the backend before presenting it to the user. This could involve escaping HTML entities or using a Content Security Policy (CSP) in the user's project where the generated code is deployed. However, backend sanitization is more relevant for this project as the vulnerability lies in the generated code itself.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP) documentation for users: While the project itself cannot enforce CSP on the user's projects, providing clear documentation advising users to implement CSP in their projects to mitigate potential XSS risks from any externally generated code, including AI-generated code, would be a valuable mitigation strategy guide.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to craft a screenshot that can be processed by the AI to generate malicious JavaScript code.
    - A user must use the screenshot-to-code application and copy the generated code into their own web project without reviewing or sanitizing it.
    - The user's web project must execute the AI-generated code in a browser environment.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Prompt Construction (`backend\prompts\__init__.py`, `backend\prompts\screenshot_system_prompts.py`):**
        - The system prompts (e.g., `HTML_TAILWIND_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) instruct the AI to generate "functional code" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They emphasize replicating the screenshot "exactly," including text and layout.
        - The user prompt is generic: "Generate code for a web page that looks exactly like this." or "Generate code for an SVG that looks exactly like this."
        - **Vulnerability Point:** The prompts do not include any instructions to sanitize output or prevent the inclusion of potentially harmful JavaScript. The AI is encouraged to generate functional code, which can include interactive elements and dynamic behavior implemented using JavaScript. This opens the door for generating malicious JavaScript if the input screenshot contains adversarial instructions.

    2. **Code Generation (`backend\routes\generate_code.py`, `backend\llm.py`):**
        - The `stream_openai_response`, `stream_claude_response`, and `stream_gemini_response` functions in `backend\llm.py` handle communication with the AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini). They send the assembled prompts and stream back the generated code.
        - `backend\routes\generate_code.py` receives user input, constructs prompts using `create_prompt` from `backend\prompts\__init__.py`, calls the appropriate LLM function, and streams the generated code back to the frontend via WebSocket.
        - `extract_html_content` in `backend\codegen\utils.py` attempts to extract HTML from the AI's response, but it does not sanitize or validate the HTML content for security vulnerabilities.
        - **Vulnerability Point:** The generated code is directly passed back to the user without any sanitization or security checks. The application trusts the AI's output, which, when influenced by malicious input, can be harmful.

    3. **Image Processing (`backend\image_processing\utils.py`):**
        - The `process_image` function in `backend\image_processing\utils.py` focuses on resizing and compressing images to meet Claude's requirements. It does not analyze the content of the image for malicious code or instructions.
        - `image_to_data_url` in `backend\evals\utils.py` simply converts image files to data URLs.
        - **Non-Vulnerability Point:** Image processing focuses on format and size, not content security. The vulnerability is not directly related to image processing, but rather how the AI interprets the content of the screenshot and generates code based on it.

                                                                    V (User Copies Code)

    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** Access to a running instance of the screenshot-to-code application.
    2. **Craft Malicious Screenshot:** Create a screenshot image (e.g., PNG or JPG). Within this screenshot, include text designed to be interpreted as malicious JavaScript code. For example, embed the following text within the screenshot: `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')">`. You can use an image editor or simply create a basic HTML page, take a screenshot of it, and use that as the input image.
    3. **Upload Screenshot:** In the screenshot-to-code application, upload the crafted malicious screenshot. Select any stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind).
    4. **Generate Code:** Initiate the code generation process.
    5. **Examine Generated Code:** Once the AI generates the code, carefully review the output HTML code. Look for the injected malicious JavaScript code. You should find code similar to what you embedded in the screenshot, such as `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')">` within the generated HTML.
    6. **Copy Generated Code:** Copy the generated HTML code to the clipboard.
    7. **Create Victim Project:** Create a simple HTML file (e.g., `victim.html`) in a local directory.
    8. **Paste Malicious Code:** Paste the copied AI-generated code directly into the `<body>` section of your `victim.html` file.
    9. **Open in Browser:** Open `victim.html` in a web browser.
    10. **Verify XSS:** Observe if an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability!" appears when the page loads. If the alert box appears, it confirms that the malicious JavaScript from the screenshot was successfully generated by the AI, injected into the HTML, and executed in the browser, demonstrating a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
