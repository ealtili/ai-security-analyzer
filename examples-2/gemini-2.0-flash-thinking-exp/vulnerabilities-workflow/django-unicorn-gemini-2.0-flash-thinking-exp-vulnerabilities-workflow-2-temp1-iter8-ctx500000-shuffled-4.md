- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in template rendering
    - Description: User-provided data rendered in Django Unicorn templates without sufficient sanitization can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Step-by-step details: 1. Attacker inputs malicious JavaScript code into a form field bound with `unicorn:model`. 2. This input is sent to the server via AJAX. 3. Django Unicorn re-renders the component, embedding the unsanitized input into the HTML. 4. The browser executes the malicious script, resulting in XSS.
    - Impact: Account Takeover, Data Theft, Website Defacement, Redirection to Malicious Sites.
    - Vulnerability Rank: High
    - Currently Implemented Mitigations: HTML encoding of responses (introduced in version 0.36.0) is the primary mitigation. CSRF protection is implemented but does not directly prevent XSS.
    - Missing Mitigations: Verify if HTML encoding is consistently applied in all rendering contexts and if it is sufficient. Ensure examples and documentation emphasize the importance of sanitizing user inputs, even though automatic HTML encoding is in place.
    - Preconditions: Django-unicorn is used to render user-provided data in templates without explicit sanitization. Attacker can input data through `unicorn:model` bindings.
    - Source Code Analysis: The `todo` component example in `README.md` and `components.md` is a potential vulnerable point if the `task` variable is rendered unsanitized. Changelog for version 0.36.0 indicates XSS fixes were implemented through HTML encoding. Need to verify codebase for consistent and sufficient encoding.
    - Security Test Case: 1. Deploy a django-unicorn application using the todo example. 2. Input `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` into the task input. 3. Add the task. 4. Check if an alert box appears, indicating XSS. 5. Verify if the rendered output is HTML encoded (`&lt;img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')&gt;`) instead of raw HTML to confirm mitigation.
