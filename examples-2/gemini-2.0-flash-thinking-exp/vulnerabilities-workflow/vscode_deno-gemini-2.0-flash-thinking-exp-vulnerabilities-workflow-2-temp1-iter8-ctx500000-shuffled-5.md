### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious `deno.path` Configuration
- Description:
    - An attacker can socially engineer a user into configuring the `deno.path` setting in the VSCode Deno extension to point to a malicious executable instead of the legitimate Deno CLI.
    - The user is tricked into manually changing the `deno.path` setting in their VSCode settings (user or workspace settings).
    - Once the `deno.path` is set to the malicious executable, any feature of the VSCode Deno extension that relies on executing the Deno CLI will inadvertently run the malicious code.
    - This includes features like:
        - Starting the Deno Language Server
        - Formatting code
        - Linting code
        - Type checking
        - Running tests (via CodeLens or Test Explorer)
        - Executing Deno tasks
    - The malicious executable will be executed with the same privileges as the VSCode user.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
    - This can lead to a complete compromise of the user's system, including:
        - Data theft and exfiltration
        - Installation of malware (viruses, ransomware, spyware)
        - System manipulation and denial of service
        - Privilege escalation
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly uses the path provided by the user in the `deno.path` setting without any validation or security checks.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation for `deno.path`**: The extension should validate the `deno.path` setting to ensure it points to a legitimate Deno executable. This could include:
        - Checking if the path is a valid executable file.
        - Verifying the file signature or checksum against known Deno CLI releases (more complex).
        - Whitelisting or recommending standard installation paths for Deno CLI and warning users if they deviate from these.
    - **User Warning on `deno.path` Configuration**: When a user manually sets or modifies the `deno.path` setting, especially if it's pointing to a location outside of standard Deno installation directories, the extension should display a clear and prominent warning message. This warning should highlight the security risks of pointing `deno.path` to untrusted executables and advise users to only set it to the legitimate Deno CLI.
- Preconditions:
    - **User Configuration of `deno.path`**: The user must manually configure the `deno.path` setting in VSCode to point to a malicious executable. This usually requires social engineering or tricking the user into performing this action.
    - **Deno Extension Enabled**: The VSCode Deno extension must be installed and enabled for the workspace where the malicious `deno.path` is configured.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **`client/src/util.ts:getDenoCommandPath()`**: This function is responsible for resolving the path to the Deno executable. It retrieves the `deno.path` setting from the VSCode configuration without any validation.
        ```typescript
        function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
          const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)
            .get<string>("path");
          return exePath; // Returns user-provided path directly, no validation.
        }

        export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
          const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
          // ... path resolution logic, but no security checks on "command" ...
        }
        ```
    - **`client/src/tasks.ts:buildDenoTask()` and `buildDenoConfigTask()`**: These functions utilize `vscode.ProcessExecution` to execute Deno CLI commands. They directly use the path obtained from `getDenoCommandName()` (which relies on `getDenoCommandPath()`) as the executable for `ProcessExecution`.
        ```typescript
        export function buildDenoTask(
          target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
          process: string, // process is the deno command path from getDenoCommandName()
          definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
          name: string,
          args: string[],
          problemMatchers: string[],
        ): vscode.Task {
          const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
            process, // User-controlled path is used directly for execution.
            args,
            definition,
          );

          return new vscode.Task(
            definition,
            target,
            name,
            TASK_SOURCE,
            exec, // ProcessExecution executes the potentially malicious path.
            problemMatchers,
          );
        }
        ```
    - **`client/src/debug_config_provider.ts:provideDebugConfigurations()`**: Debug configurations also use `getDenoCommandName()` to determine the `runtimeExecutable`. This means debugging sessions can also execute the malicious path.
        ```typescript
        async provideDebugConfigurations(): Promise<vscode.DebugConfiguration[]> {
          const config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS);
          const debugConfig: vscode.DebugConfiguration = {
            // ...
            runtimeExecutable: await getDenoCommandName(), // Malicious path used for debugging runtime.
            // ...
          };
          return [debugConfig];
        }
        ```
    - **`client/src/commands.ts:startLanguageServer()`**: The language server itself is launched using the path obtained from `getDenoCommandPath()`. If this path is malicious, the language server process will be malicious as well.
        ```typescript
        export function startLanguageServer(
          context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
          extensionContext: DenoExtensionContext,
        ): Callback {
          return async () => {
            // ...
            const command = await getDenoCommandPath(); // Malicious path can be used here.
            if (command == null) {
              // ...
            }

            const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
              run: {
                command, // Malicious path used for starting language server.
                args: ["lsp"],
                options: { env },
              },
              debug: {
                command, // Malicious path used for debugging language server.
                args: ["lsp"],
                options: { env },
              },
            };
            // ...
          }
        }
        ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Create a Malicious Executable**:
        - Create a simple script that will serve as the malicious executable.
        - For example, on Windows, create a `malicious_deno.bat` file with the following content:
            ```batch
            @echo off
            echo Malicious Deno Executable Running!
            echo You have been PWNED by malicious Deno extension > pwned.txt
            ```
        - On Linux/macOS, create a `malicious_deno.sh` file:
            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "Malicious Deno Executable Running!"
            echo "You have been PWNED by malicious Deno extension" > pwned.txt
            chmod +x malicious_deno.sh
            ```
    2. **Configure `deno.path` to Malicious Executable**:
        - In VSCode, open User Settings (JSON) or Workspace Settings (JSON).
        - Add or modify the `deno.path` setting to point to the malicious executable created in step 1.
            ```json
            "deno.path": "path/to/malicious_deno.bat" // Windows example
            // or
            "deno.path": "/path/to/malicious_deno.sh" // Linux/macOS example
            ```
    3. **Trigger Deno Extension Feature**:
        - Open any JavaScript or TypeScript file in VSCode.
        - Trigger any Deno extension feature that uses the Deno CLI. For example:
            - Format the document (Right-click in the editor -> "Format Document").
    4. **Verify Malicious Code Execution**:
        - After triggering the formatting (or any other Deno feature), check for the observable effects of the malicious executable.
        - In this test case, verify that a file named `pwned.txt` has been created in your workspace directory with the message "You have been PWNED by malicious Deno extension".
        - Additionally, you might see "Malicious Deno Executable Running!" printed in the output panel or terminal depending on VSCode configuration and how the script is executed.
    5. **Expected Result**:
        - If the `pwned.txt` file is created and contains the expected message, it confirms that the malicious executable was successfully executed by the VSCode Deno extension due to the manipulated `deno.path` setting. This proves the Arbitrary Code Execution vulnerability.
