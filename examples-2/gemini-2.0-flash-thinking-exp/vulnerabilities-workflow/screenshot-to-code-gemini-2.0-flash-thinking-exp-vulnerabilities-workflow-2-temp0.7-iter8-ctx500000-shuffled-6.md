### Vulnerability 1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Maliciously Crafted Screenshots

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a screenshot that includes text content designed to be interpreted as HTML or Javascript code when processed by the AI model. For example, the screenshot could visually represent an input field with the text `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`.
    2. The user uploads this crafted screenshot to the application.
    3. The backend sends the screenshot to the AI model (e.g., GPT-4 Vision or Claude) to generate frontend code.
    4. The AI model, interpreting the text content in the screenshot, generates HTML code that includes the malicious script directly, for instance, `<div><img src=x onerror=alert(1)></div>`.
    5. The backend sends this generated code back to the frontend, and the user might download or deploy this code.
    6. When a user deploys and opens the generated HTML code in a browser, the malicious script embedded in the `onerror` attribute of the `<img>` tag executes, leading to an XSS vulnerability. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript code in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing other malicious actions.

* Impact:
    - High
    - Successful exploitation leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary Javascript code in the browser of users who deploy the generated code.
    - This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code generation process directly translates the content of the screenshot into code without any sanitization or encoding of potentially malicious HTML or Javascript.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Output Sanitization/Encoding:** The backend should sanitize or encode the generated HTML code before sending it to the frontend. Specifically, HTML entities within the generated code should be encoded to prevent браузер from interpreting them as executable code. For example, `<` should be encoded as `&lt;`, `>` as `&gt;`, `"` as `&quot;`, and `'` as `&#x27;`.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a mitigation within the backend code itself, advising users to implement CSP in their deployed applications would be a strong mitigation against XSS. However, this is a documentation/best practice approach, not a direct code fix.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to craft a screenshot with text content that can be misinterpreted as code by the AI model.
    - The user must upload this crafted screenshot and generate code.
    - The user must deploy and open the generated code in a web browser.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - **`backend/routes/generate_code.py`:** This file handles the code generation process. It receives parameters from the frontend, including the image, and uses the `create_prompt` function from `prompts/__init__.py` to prepare prompts for the AI model. The response from the AI model is then streamed back to the frontend. There is no code in this file that sanitizes or encodes the AI-generated code before sending it back to the client.
    - **`backend/prompts/__init__.py` & `backend/prompts/screenshot_system_prompts.py`:** These files define the prompts sent to the AI model. The prompts instruct the AI to generate code based on the screenshot.  The system prompts (e.g., `HTML_TAILWIND_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) emphasize creating code that "looks exactly like the screenshot" and uses "the exact text from the screenshot". This instruction, while aiming for accuracy in replication, inadvertently encourages the AI to include potentially malicious content verbatim from the screenshot into the generated code without any security considerations.
    - **`backend/codegen/utils.py`:** The `extract_html_content` function simply extracts the HTML content from the AI's response using regular expressions. It does not perform any sanitization or encoding.

    ```python
    # backend/codegen/utils.py
    import re

    def extract_html_content(text: str):
        # Use regex to find content within <html> tags and include the tags themselves
        match = re.search(r"(<html.*?>.*?</html>)", text, re.DOTALL)
        if match:
            return match.group(1)
        else:
            # Otherwise, we just send the previous HTML over
            print(
                "[HTML Extraction] No <html> tags found in the generated content: " + text
            )
            return text
    ```
    - The code directly takes the generated HTML from the AI and returns it without any modification that would prevent XSS. The vulnerability lies in the lack of output encoding after receiving the generated code from the LLM and before sending it to the frontend.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a screenshot image (e.g., PNG or JPEG).
    2. In the screenshot, include text that will be interpreted as a malicious HTML tag. For example, visually render the following text as part of the screenshot:  `<input type="text" value="Click Me" onclick="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')">`
    3. Upload this screenshot to the application through the frontend.
    4. Select any supported stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind).
    5. Click the "Generate Code" button.
    6. After the code generation is complete, download the generated code (typically an HTML file).
    7. Open the downloaded HTML file in a web browser.
    8. Observe that when the page loads, or when you interact with the injected element (in this case, clicking the "Click Me" input), a Javascript alert box appears with the text "XSS Vulnerability!".
    9. If the alert box appears, it confirms that the XSS vulnerability is present because the malicious Javascript code from the screenshot was successfully injected into the generated HTML and executed by the browser.
