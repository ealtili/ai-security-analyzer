### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Task Execution

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Deno project.
    2. Within this project, the attacker creates a `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` configuration file. This file is intentionally designed to include a malicious task definition. The malicious task definition contains a command that, when executed, will perform arbitrary actions on the user's system. This is achieved through command injection techniques embedded within the task's command string.
    3. A user, intending to work on or inspect the project, opens this malicious Deno project in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension active.
    4. The Deno extension parses the `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` file, reading and registering the task definitions, including the malicious one. These tasks are then displayed in the Deno Tasks sidebar in VS Code.
    5. Unsuspecting of the embedded threat, the user interacts with the Deno Tasks sidebar and selects the malicious task, intending to execute what they believe to be a legitimate project task.
    6. Upon execution, the Deno extension directly passes the command string from the task definition to the system's shell for execution without proper sanitization or validation. This results in the execution of the attacker's malicious command, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.

- Impact:
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This can lead to a range of malicious activities, including:
    - Data theft: Sensitive information, including personal files, credentials, and project-related data, can be exfiltrated from the user's system.
    - Malware installation: The attacker can install malware, such as ransomware, spyware, or viruses, to further compromise the user's system and potentially spread to other systems on the network.
    - System compromise: Complete control over the user's system can be achieved, allowing the attacker to perform any action a legitimate user can, including modifying, deleting, or encrypting data; creating new accounts; or using the system as a bot in a botnet.
    - Privilege escalation: If the user is running VS Code with elevated privileges, the attacker could potentially escalate privileges to gain even deeper access to the system.
    - Denial of service: Although not the primary impact, arbitrary code execution can be used to cause a denial of service by crashing the system or consuming excessive resources.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None identified in the provided project files. A review of the source code, particularly in `client\src\tasks.ts` and `client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`, indicates that task commands and arguments are passed directly to `vscode.ProcessExecution` without sanitization or validation.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization and Validation: Implement robust sanitization and validation of task commands and arguments before execution. This should include escaping shell-sensitive characters and validating against a whitelist of allowed commands or command patterns.
    - Parameterized Commands: Instead of directly executing shell commands, consider using parameterized commands where the command itself is fixed and user inputs are passed as arguments in a safe manner, preventing injection.
    - Secure Task Execution Environment: Explore running tasks in a sandboxed or isolated environment with restricted permissions to limit the potential damage from malicious commands.
    - User Confirmation and Review: Implement a mechanism to prompt users for confirmation before executing tasks, especially those defined in workspace configurations, and display the command to be executed for user review. Highlight potentially dangerous commands or patterns.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure the extension itself and any executed tasks operate with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the Deno extension for Visual Studio Code installed and enabled.
    - The user must open a workspace or folder in VS Code that contains a maliciously crafted `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` file, or be subject to a compromised Deno language server providing malicious task definitions.
    - The user must interact with the Deno Tasks sidebar and attempt to execute the malicious task.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`
        - The `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider` class is responsible for displaying tasks in the sidebar and handling task execution.
        - The `#runTask(task: DenoTask)` method is called when a user attempts to run a task from the sidebar.
        - This method directly calls `tasks.executeTask(task.task);` to execute the task.
        - The `DenoTask` class holds a `vscode.Task` object, which is created in `DenoTaskProvider` and `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider`.

    - File: `client\src\tasks.ts`
        - The `buildDenoTask` function constructs a `vscode.Task` object.
        - It uses `vscode.ProcessExecution` to define how the task is executed.
        - The `command` and `args` parameters of `DenoTaskDefinition` are directly passed to the `ProcessExecution` constructor:
        ```typescript
        const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
            process,
            args, // args is directly derived from DenoTaskDefinition.args
            definition,
        );
        ```
        - There is no visible sanitization or validation of the `command` or `args` within these files or in the process of creating or executing tasks. The extension relies on the task definitions as they are provided, which, if maliciously crafted, leads to command injection.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new directory named `malicious-deno-project`.
    2. Navigate into this directory in your terminal.
    3. Create a file named `deno.jsonc` in this directory with the following content:
        ```jsonc
        {
          "tasks": {
            "maliciousTask": "echo 'Vulnerable' && calc.exe" // For Windows. For Linux/macOS, use 'echo "Vulnerable" && xcalc' or similar.
          }
        }
        ```
        *Note: Replace `calc.exe` with a command appropriate for your operating system to demonstrate arbitrary code execution, like `xcalc` on Linux or `open /Applications/Calculator.app` on macOS.*
    4. Open Visual Studio Code.
    5. Use "File" > "Open Folder..." and open the `malicious-deno-project` directory you created.
    6. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace. If prompted to enable Deno, click "Enable".
    7. Open the "Deno Tasks" sidebar in VS Code. You can usually find this in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code (icon may resemble a wrench or script). If not visible, right-click in the Activity Bar and ensure "Deno Tasks" is checked.
    8. In the "Deno Tasks" sidebar, you should see your project folder and under it, the `deno.jsonc` file. Expand `deno.jsonc` to reveal the "maliciousTask".
    9. Click the "Run Task" icon (usually a play button) next to "maliciousTask".
    10. Observe the behavior.
        - You should see the output "Vulnerable" in the task output panel, confirming part of the command was executed.
        - You should also observe the Calculator application (or the application you chose in step 3) launching, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.

    This test confirms that the extension executes commands directly from the `deno.jsonc` task definition without sanitization, leading to a command injection vulnerability.
