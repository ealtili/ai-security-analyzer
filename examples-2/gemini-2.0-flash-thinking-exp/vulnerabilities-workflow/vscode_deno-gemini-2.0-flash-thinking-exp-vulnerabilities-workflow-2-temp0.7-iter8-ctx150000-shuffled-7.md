### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious `deno.path` Configuration

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious executable designed to mimic or replace the legitimate Deno CLI.
    2. The attacker social engineers or tricks a user into manually configuring the `deno.path` setting in the VS Code Deno extension to point to this malicious executable instead of the actual Deno CLI. This could be achieved through phishing, misleading instructions, or by compromising the user's settings synchronization.
    3. Once the user saves the settings with the malicious `deno.path`, the VS Code Deno extension, upon activation or when triggered by Deno-related commands (like starting the language server, running tests, upgrading Deno, or debugging), will use the path specified in `deno.path` to execute what it believes to be the Deno CLI.
    4. Because `deno.path` now points to the attacker's malicious executable, arbitrary code from this executable will be executed on the user's machine with the same privileges as the VS Code process.

- Impact:
    - **Critical**: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This can lead to a full compromise of the user's local system, including data theft, malware installation, account takeover, and further propagation of attacks within the user's network.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The extension currently directly uses the path provided in the `deno.path` setting without any validation or sanitization. There is no check to ensure that the provided path points to a legitimate Deno CLI executable.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation**: Implement validation for the `deno.path` setting. This should include checks to verify that the path is a valid executable and potentially attempt to verify if it is a genuine Deno CLI. Simple checks could include verifying the executable name and potentially checking the file signature or hash against known Deno CLI signatures.
    - **User Warning**: Display a prominent warning message to the user when they manually change the `deno.path` setting, especially if it's pointing to a location outside of typical installation directories. This warning should highlight the security risks of pointing `deno.path` to untrusted executables and advise users to only set this to the legitimate Deno CLI.
    - **Path Sanitization**: Sanitize the `deno.path` input to prevent path traversal attacks or command injection vulnerabilities, although the primary risk here is direct execution of a replaced binary.
    - **Default to PATH Lookup**: Emphasize in documentation and potentially in the settings UI that relying on the environment PATH for Deno CLI resolution is the most secure default, and manually setting `deno.path` should be done with caution.

- Preconditions:
    - The VS Code Deno extension must be installed and activated.
    - The user must have the ability to modify VS Code settings (either user settings or workspace settings).
    - An attacker must be able to convince or trick the user into setting the `deno.path` configuration to a malicious executable path.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`client/src/util.ts:getDenoCommandPath()`**: This function is responsible for resolving the Deno command path.
    ```typescript
    export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
      const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath(); // Reads 'deno.path' setting
      const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
      if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
        return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand(); // Fallback to default lookup
      } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
        // ... (relative path resolution logic) ...
      } else {
        return command; // Returns user-configured path directly
      }
    }
    ```
    Visualization:
    ```
    [VS Code Settings] --> 'deno.path' setting --> getDenoCommandPath() --> Returns path (potentially malicious)
    ```
    The `getDenoCommandPath` function retrieves the `deno.path` setting using `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`. If a value is set and is an absolute path (or resolved as such), it is directly returned without any validation.

    2. **`client/src/commands.ts:startLanguageServer()` and other command handlers**: Functions like `startLanguageServer`, `test`, `denoUpgradePromptAndExecute`, and `DenoDebugConfigurationProvider` use the resolved command path from `getDenoCommandPath()` or `getDenoCommandName()` to execute Deno CLI commands.
    ```typescript
    // Example from client/src/commands.ts:startLanguageServer()
    const command = await getDenoCommandPath(); // Resolves deno command path
    if (command == null) {
      // ... error handling ...
      return;
    }

    const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
      run: {
        command, // Malicious command path is used here
        args: ["lsp"],
        options: { env },
      },
      debug: {
        command, // Malicious command path is used here
        args: ["lsp"],
        options: { env },
      },
    };
    const client = new LanguageClient( ... serverOptions, ...);
    await client.start();
    ```
    Visualization:
    ```
    getDenoCommandPath() --> [Command Path (potentially malicious)] --> LanguageClient/Task Execution --> Arbitrary Code Execution
    ```
    The resolved `command` is then used in `ServerOptions` when creating the `LanguageClient` or in `vscode.tasks.executeTask` for task execution, leading to the execution of the potentially malicious executable.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Executable:**
        - Create a file named `malicious_deno.sh` (or `malicious_deno.bat` on Windows) in a directory like `/tmp` (or `C:\temp`).
        - Add the following content to `malicious_deno.sh`:
            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "[VULNERABILITY TEST] Malicious Deno Executable Executed!"
            echo "[VULNERABILITY TEST] You are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via deno.path!"
            exit 1
            ```
        - Make the script executable: `chmod +x /tmp/malicious_deno.sh`
        - For Windows `malicious_deno.bat`:
            ```bat
            @echo off
            echo [VULNERABILITY TEST] Malicious Deno Executable Executed!
            echo [VULNERABILITY TEST] You are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via deno.path!
            exit 1
            ```
    2. **Configure VS Code Deno Extension:**
        - Open VS Code.
        - Go to VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`).
        - Search for "deno.path".
        - Set the `Deno â€º Path` setting to the path of the malicious executable you created, e.g., `/tmp/malicious_deno.sh` (or `C:\temp\malicious_deno.bat`).
    3. **Enable Deno in Workspace:**
        - Open a JavaScript or TypeScript file in VS Code.
        - Run the command "Deno: Enable" from the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
    4. **Observe Execution:**
        - Check the VS Code Output panel (select "Deno Language Server" in the dropdown).
        - You should see the output from the malicious executable, confirming arbitrary code execution:
            ```
            [VULNERABILITY TEST] Malicious Deno Executable Executed!
            [VULNERABILITY TEST] You are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via deno.path!
            ```
        - Alternatively, trigger other Deno extension functionalities like running tests or upgrading Deno to further verify the vulnerability in different contexts.

This test case demonstrates that by manipulating the `deno.path` setting, an attacker can indeed execute arbitrary code through the VS Code Deno extension.
