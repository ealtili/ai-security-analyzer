## Vulnerability Report

### Vulnerability Name
Potential Image Processing Vulnerability in Image Resizing and Compression

### Description
The `process_image` function in `backend/image_processing/utils.py` utilizes the Pillow (PIL) library to resize and compress user-provided images to meet the constraints of the Claude API. This function takes a base64 encoded image data URL as input, decodes it, and then uses PIL to open, resize, and re-encode the image.  If a malicious user crafts a specially designed image and submits it to the application, it could potentially trigger vulnerabilities within the Pillow library during image processing, specifically within the resizing or saving operations. This could lead to various security issues, including but not limited to remote code execution, denial of service, or arbitrary file access, depending on the specific vulnerability in PIL and how it's exploited.

Step-by-step trigger instructions:
1. An attacker crafts a malicious image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG) designed to exploit a known or unknown vulnerability in the Pillow library.
2. The attacker converts this malicious image into a base64 encoded data URL.
3. The attacker uploads this base64 encoded data URL to the `screenshot-to-code` application, specifically targeting functionalities that utilize image processing, such as screenshot-to-code conversion or video-to-code conversion.
4. The backend of the `screenshot-to-code` application receives the data URL and, in the `process_image` function, decodes the base64 data and attempts to process the image using PIL, including resizing and saving operations.
5. If the malicious image successfully triggers a vulnerability in PIL during processing, it could lead to unintended consequences such as remote code execution on the server, denial of service due to excessive resource consumption, or potentially arbitrary file system access depending on the nature of the PIL vulnerability.

### Impact
The impact of this vulnerability could be **critical**. Successful exploitation could lead to:
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the `screenshot-to-code` application, gaining full control over the system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Processing a malicious image could consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory), leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
- **Arbitrary File System Access:** Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, an attacker might be able to read or write arbitrary files on the server's file system.

### Vulnerability Rank
**Critical**

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
Currently, there are no specific mitigations implemented within the project code to directly address potential image processing vulnerabilities in the `process_image` function or within the PIL library itself. The application relies on the security of the underlying libraries and system environment.

### Missing Mitigations
The following mitigations are missing and should be implemented to reduce the risk of image processing vulnerabilities:
- **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation on the image data URL and the decoded image data before processing it with PIL. This could include checks on file type, file size, and image dimensions to reject potentially malicious or oversized images.
- **Pillow Version Management and Updates:** Regularly update the Pillow library to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities. Implement dependency management practices to ensure that a secure version of Pillow is always in use.
- **Sandboxing or Containerization:** Run the image processing tasks in a sandboxed environment or within containers with restricted privileges. This can limit the impact of a successful exploit by containing it within the isolated environment and preventing it from affecting the host system.
- **Memory Limits and Resource Controls:** Implement memory limits and resource controls for image processing operations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by maliciously crafted images consuming excessive resources.
- **Security Audits and Vulnerability Scanning:** Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scanning of the application and its dependencies, including Pillow, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.

### Preconditions
- The application must be publicly accessible and allow users to upload images (e.g., for screenshot-to-code or video-to-code conversion).
- The backend must utilize the `process_image` function from `backend/image_processing/utils.py` to handle user-uploaded images.
- A vulnerability must exist within the Pillow library that can be triggered by a maliciously crafted image during processing operations like resizing or saving.

### Source Code Analysis

The vulnerability lies within the `process_image` function in `backend/image_processing/utils.py`:

```python
# ..\screenshot-to-code\backend\image_processing\utils.py
import base64
import io
import time
from PIL import Image

CLAUDE_IMAGE_MAX_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024
CLAUDE_MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION = 7990


# Process image so it meets Claude requirements
def process_image(image_data_url: str) -> tuple[str, str]:

    # Extract bytes and media type from base64 data URL
    media_type = image_data_url.split(";")[0].split(":")[1]
    base64_data = image_data_url.split(",")[1]
    image_bytes = base64.b64decode(base64_data)

    img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes)) # Potential Vulnerability Point 1: Image.open

    # Check if image is under max dimensions and size
    is_under_dimension_limit = (
        img.width < CLAUDE_MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION
        and img.height < CLAUDE_MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION
    )
    is_under_size_limit = len(base64_data) <= CLAUDE_IMAGE_MAX_SIZE

    # If image is under both limits, no processing needed
    if is_under_dimension_limit and is_under_size_limit:
        print("[CLAUDE IMAGE PROCESSING] no processing needed")
        return (media_type, base64_data)

    # Time image processing
    start_time = time.time()

    # Check if either dimension exceeds 7900px (Claude disallows >= 8000px)
    # Resize image if needed
    if not is_under_dimension_limit:
        # Calculate the new dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio
        if img.width > img.height:
            new_width = CLAUDE_MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION
            new_height = int((CLAUDE_MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION / img.width) * img.height)
        else:
            new_height = CLAUDE_MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION
            new_width = int((CLAUDE_MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION / img.height) * img.width)

        # Resize the image
        img = img.resize((new_width, new_height), Image.DEFAULT_STRATEGY) # Potential Vulnerability Point 2: img.resize
        print(
            f"[CLAUDE IMAGE PROCESSING] image resized: width = {new_width}, height = {new_height}"
        )

    # Convert and compress as JPEG
    # We always compress as JPEG (95% at the least) even when we resize and the original image
    # is under the size limit.
    quality = 95
    output = io.BytesIO()
    img = img.convert("RGB")  # Ensure image is in RGB mode for JPEG conversion
    img.save(output, format="JPEG", quality=quality) # Potential Vulnerability Point 3: img.save

    # Reduce quality until image is under max size
    while (
        len(base64.b64encode(output.getvalue())) > CLAUDE_IMAGE_MAX_SIZE
        and quality > 10
    ):
        output = io.BytesIO()
        img.save(output, format="JPEG", quality=quality) # Potential Vulnerability Point 4: img.save
        quality -= 5

    # Log so we know it was modified
    old_size = len(base64_data)
    new_size = len(base64.b64encode(output.getvalue()))
    print(
        f"[CLAUDE IMAGE PROCESSING] image size updated: old size = {old_size} bytes, new size = {new_size} bytes"
    )

    end_time = time.time()
    processing_time = end_time - start_time
    print(f"[CLAUDE IMAGE PROCESSING] processing time: {processing_time:.2f} seconds")

    return ("image/jpeg", base64.b64encode(output.getvalue()).decode("utf-8"))
```

**Vulnerability Points:**

1.  **`Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes))`**: PIL's `Image.open()` function is known to be vulnerable to various image processing attacks when handling malformed or malicious image files. By providing a specially crafted image, an attacker could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the image decoding process.
2.  **`img.resize(...)`**: Image resizing operations in PIL, especially when combined with specific resampling filters or image formats, can be vulnerable to integer overflows or other memory corruption issues.
3.  **`img.save(output, format="JPEG", quality=quality)`**:  Saving images, especially to specific formats like JPEG with quality settings, can also be a potential vulnerability point if there are flaws in the encoding libraries used by PIL or in the format handling logic.

These operations, especially when performed on user-provided data without sufficient validation, represent potential entry points for image processing vulnerabilities.

### Security Test Case

**Test Case Title:** Image Processing Vulnerability Test - Malicious JPEG Upload

**Objective:** To verify if a malicious JPEG image can trigger a vulnerability during image processing in the `process_image` function.

**Preconditions:**
- A publicly accessible instance of the `screenshot-to-code` application is running.
- The target instance utilizes the `process_image` function to process uploaded images.
- Attacker has access to tools to craft malicious JPEG images (e.g., `Metasploit`, `libjpeg-turbo` exploit generators, or publicly available malicious image samples).

**Step-by-step Test:**
1. **Craft Malicious JPEG:** Using a vulnerability research tool or a known exploit generator, create a malicious JPEG image file designed to trigger a known vulnerability in the Pillow library during processing (e.g., a heap overflow during JPEG decoding or saving, or a vulnerability in resizing logic). Example vulnerability types could include buffer overflows, integer overflows, or format string bugs, if any known PIL JPEG vulnerabilities exist. If no readily available exploit is known, research publicly disclosed PIL vulnerabilities and attempt to craft an image targeting a likely vulnerability area, or use a generic fuzzer targeting PIL's JPEG handling.
2. **Base64 Encode Malicious JPEG:** Convert the crafted malicious JPEG image file into a base64 encoded data URL.
3. **Upload Malicious Image:** Access the `screenshot-to-code` application through a web browser or using an API client. Utilize a feature that allows image upload, such as the screenshot-to-code conversion feature. Replace the legitimate image upload with the base64 encoded malicious JPEG data URL. Submit the request to the application.
4. **Monitor Server Behavior:** Observe the server's behavior after submitting the malicious image. Monitor server logs for error messages, crashes, or unusual activity. Monitor server resource consumption (CPU, memory) for spikes that could indicate a denial of service. If possible, use network monitoring tools to observe network traffic for unexpected outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts, although RCE is more likely to be directly observable on the server in this type of vulnerability.
5. **Verify Vulnerability (if triggered):**
    - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If RCE is suspected, attempt to execute a command on the server. This could involve trying to trigger a reverse shell or simply attempt to write a file to a known location on the server if possible to confirm code execution.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** If DoS is suspected, confirm that the server becomes unresponsive or significantly slow due to resource exhaustion after processing the malicious image.
    - **Arbitrary File System Access:** If file system access is suspected and the nature of the PIL vulnerability allows, attempt to read a sensitive file from the server (e.g., `/etc/passwd` or application configuration files), or attempt to create or modify a file in a writable directory if the vulnerability allows write access.
6. **Analyze Results:** Based on the server behavior observed in step 4 and the verification attempts in step 5, determine if the malicious JPEG image successfully triggered a vulnerability in the image processing pipeline. Document the findings, including any error messages, server crashes, or successful exploit outcomes.

**Expected Result:** If a suitable malicious JPEG image is crafted to exploit a vulnerability in PIL's image processing, and if the application is vulnerable, the test case may result in:
- Server crash or unexpected errors logged.
- Denial of service due to resource exhaustion.
- (Potentially) Remote code execution on the server.

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- **Fail:** The test case is considered a **failure (vulnerability confirmed)** if the malicious JPEG image triggers any of the following: server crash, denial of service, or indications of potential remote code execution or arbitrary file system access.
- **Pass:** The test case is considered a **pass (vulnerability not directly confirmed)** if the server processes the image without crashing, experiencing denial of service, or showing any signs of exploitation. A "pass" in this test case does not definitively mean the application is not vulnerable, but it indicates that this specific malicious JPEG image did not trigger an easily observable vulnerability. Further testing with different types of malicious images and vulnerability research may be needed.


This security test case provides a starting point for evaluating the potential image processing vulnerability.  It focuses on JPEG files, but similar test cases should be created for other image formats supported by PIL (e.g., PNG, GIF, TIFF) and processed by the `process_image` function, and different types of known or potential PIL vulnerabilities should be targeted for comprehensive testing.
