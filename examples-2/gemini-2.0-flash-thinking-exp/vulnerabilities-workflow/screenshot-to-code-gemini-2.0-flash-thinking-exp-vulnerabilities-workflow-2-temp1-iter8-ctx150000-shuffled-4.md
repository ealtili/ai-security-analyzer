- Vulnerability name: Image Processing Vulnerability via PIL
- Description:
    1. An attacker uploads a maliciously crafted image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG) to the application.
    2. The backend receives the image and processes it using the PIL (Pillow) library in the `process_image` function located in `backend\image_processing\utils.py`.
    3. The `process_image` function uses PIL's `Image.open`, `Image.resize`, and `Image.save` functions.
    4. A maliciously crafted image can exploit vulnerabilities within PIL during these operations, such as buffer overflows or out-of-bounds reads, leading to arbitrary code execution on the backend server.
    5. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the backend server.
- Vulnerability rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. The code directly uses PIL for image processing without any apparent vulnerability mitigation.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation: While file type validation is a general security practice, it's insufficient against sophisticated image-based attacks.
    - Input sanitization: Implementing robust sanitization for image data is complex but could involve content security policies or safer image handling libraries.
    - Dependency management: Ensure PIL (Pillow) library is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    - Sandboxing: Process image files in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.
- Preconditions:
    - The application must be running and accessible to the attacker.
    - The attacker must be able to upload an image file to the application.
    - The backend must process the uploaded image using the vulnerable PIL operations in `backend\image_processing\utils.py`.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `backend\image_processing\utils.py`
    - The `process_image` function in `backend\image_processing\utils.py` uses PIL to process image data.
    - Vulnerable code snippet:
    ```python
    from PIL import Image
    ...
    img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes))
    ...
    img = img.resize((new_width, new_height), Image.DEFAULT_STRATEGY)
    ...
    img = img.convert("RGB")
    img.save(output, format="JPEG", quality=quality)
    ```
    - This code directly uses PIL's `Image.open`, `Image.resize`, and `Image.save` functions on user-provided image data. If a malicious image is crafted to exploit a vulnerability in PIL during these operations, it can lead to RCE.
- Security test case:
    1. Set up a local instance of the screenshot-to-code application.
    2. Prepare a malicious image file (e.g., a PNG or JPEG file) designed to exploit a known PIL vulnerability.
    3. Use browser's developer tools or a proxy to intercept the request when uploading a screenshot in the application.
    4. Replace the legitimate screenshot image data in the intercepted request with the malicious image data.
    5. Send the modified request to the backend server.
    6. Monitor the backend server for signs of exploitation, such as crashes, errors, or unexpected behavior.
    7. If the backend seems compromised, attempt to execute arbitrary commands to confirm RCE, for example by trying to create a file in `/tmp` or making a DNS request to a controlled server.

- Vulnerability name: Video Processing Vulnerability via MoviePy
- Description:
    1. An attacker uploads a maliciously crafted video file (e.g., MOV, MP4) to the application.
    2. The backend receives the video and processes it using the MoviePy library in the `split_video_into_screenshots` function located in `backend\video\utils.py`.
    3. The `split_video_into_screenshots` function uses MoviePy's `VideoFileClip` to load and process the video.
    4. A maliciously crafted video can exploit vulnerabilities within MoviePy or its underlying video decoding libraries (like FFmpeg) during video loading and frame extraction, leading to arbitrary code execution on the backend server.
    5. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the backend server.
- Vulnerability rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. The code directly uses MoviePy for video processing without any apparent vulnerability mitigation.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation: While file type validation is a general security practice, it's insufficient against video processing exploits.
    - Input sanitization: Implementing robust sanitization for video data is complex.
    - Dependency management: Ensure MoviePy and its dependencies (like FFmpeg) are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    - Sandboxing: Process video files in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.

    - The `split_video_into_screenshots` function in `backend\video\utils.py` uses MoviePy to process video data.
    - Vulnerable code snippet:
    ```python
    from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip
    ...
    clip = VideoFileClip(temp_video_file.name)
    ...
    ```
    - This code utilizes MoviePy's `VideoFileClip` to load and process user-provided video data. If a malicious video is crafted to exploit a vulnerability in MoviePy or its dependencies during video processing, it can lead to RCE.
- Security test case:
    1. Set up a local instance of the screenshot-to-code application.
