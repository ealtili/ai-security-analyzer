### Vulnerability List

*   #### Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in `deno.testing.args`

*   #### Description:
    1.  The Visual Studio Code Deno extension allows users to configure test arguments via the `deno.testing.args` setting.
    2.  This setting is intended to provide additional arguments to the Deno CLI test command.
    3.  However, the extension does not properly sanitize or validate these arguments.
    4.  An attacker can modify the `deno.testing.args` setting in the workspace or user settings to inject arbitrary shell commands.
    5.  When the extension executes tests (e.g., via code lens or test explorer), it uses the Deno CLI and includes the attacker-controlled arguments from `deno.testing.args` directly in the command.
    6.  This results in the injected shell commands being executed by the system.

*   #### Impact:
    *   **High/Critical**: Successful command injection can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the user running VS Code.
    *   Attackers could potentially steal sensitive data, install malware, modify system configurations, or perform other malicious actions.
    *   The vulnerability is easily exploitable if a user is persuaded to modify their VS Code settings, which can be done through social engineering or by compromising a project's workspace settings.

*   #### Vulnerability Rank: Critical

*   #### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    *   **None**: The code directly uses the arguments from the `deno.testing.args` setting without any sanitization or validation before passing them to the `ProcessExecution` API.

*   #### Missing Mitigations:
    *   **Input Sanitization**: The extension should sanitize the `deno.testing.args` setting to prevent command injection. This could involve:
        *   Validating that the arguments are safe and do not contain shell metacharacters or command separators.
        *   Using parameterized commands or APIs that prevent shell injection.
        *   Whitelisting allowed arguments and rejecting any others.
    *   **Warning to User**: When using `deno.testing.args`, especially when non-default values are set, a security warning should be displayed to the user about the risks of command injection and the importance of only using trusted arguments.

*   #### Preconditions:
    1.  User has the Visual Studio Code Deno extension installed and enabled.
    2.  User has Deno CLI installed and configured for use with the extension.
    3.  Attacker can persuade the user to modify the `deno.testing.args` setting in their user or workspace settings. This could be achieved by:
        *   Social engineering: convincing the user to manually change the setting.
        *   Workspace settings modification: if the attacker has write access to the workspace (e.g., through a malicious repository).

*   #### Source Code Analysis:

    1.  **File: `client/src/commands.ts` - `test` function:**
        ```typescript
        export function test(
          _context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
          extensionContext: DenoExtensionContext,
        ): Callback {
          return async (uriStr: string, name: string, options: TestCommandOptions) => {
            const uri = vscode.Uri.parse(uriStr, true);
            const filePath = uri.fsPath;
            const config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS, uri);
            const testArgs: string[] = [
              ...(config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs") ?? []), // <-- Vulnerable setting is read here
            ];
            // ... (rest of the code to construct test command) ...

            const args = ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", nameRegex, filePath];

            const definition: tasks.DenoTaskDefinition = {
              type: tasks.TASK_TYPE,
              command: "test",
              args, // <-- Unsanitized args are used here
              env,
            };

            // ... (code to execute task) ...
            assert(workspaceFolder);
            const denoCommand = await getDenoCommandName();
            const task = tasks.buildDenoTask(
              workspaceFolder,
              denoCommand,
              definition,
              `test "${name}"`,
              args, // <-- Unsanitized args are passed to buildDenoTask
              ["$deno-test"],
            );

            // ... (execute task) ...
            return createdTask;
          };
        }
        ```
        **Visualization:**

        ```
        [VS Code Setting: deno.testing.args] --> (config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs")) --> testArgs: string[]
                                                                                                    |
                                                                                                    V
        args: string[] = ["test", ...testArgs, ...]                                                |
                                                                                                    V
        definition: tasks.DenoTaskDefinition = { args }                                            |
                                                                                                    V
        buildDenoTask(..., args) --> vscode.ProcessExecution(denoCommand, args) --> System Command Execution
        ```

    2.  **File: `client/src/tasks.ts` - `buildDenoTask` function:**
        ```typescript
        export function buildDenoTask(
          target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
          process: string,
          definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
          name: string,
          args: string[], // <-- Arguments from commands.ts are received here
          problemMatchers: string[],
        ): vscode.Task {
          const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution( // <-- ProcessExecution is created with unsanitized args
            process,
            args, // <-- Unsanitized arguments are passed directly to ProcessExecution
            definition,
          );

          return new vscode.Task(
            definition,
            target,
            name,
            TASK_SOURCE,
            exec, // <-- ProcessExecution with unsanitized args is used in Task
            problemMatchers,
          );
        }
        ```

    **Explanation:**
    The code clearly shows that the `deno.testing.args` setting is read and its values are directly used to construct the arguments for the Deno CLI command executed via `vscode.ProcessExecution`. There is no input validation or sanitization performed on these arguments, making the extension vulnerable to command injection.

*   #### Security Test Case:

    **Step-by-step test to prove the vulnerability:**

    1.  **Setup:**
        *   Open Visual Studio Code.
        *   Install the Deno extension.
        *   Open a workspace folder.
        *   Enable Deno for the workspace (if not already enabled).
        *   Create a new file named `test_vuln.ts` in the workspace with the following content:
            ```typescript
            import { assertEquals } from "https://deno.land/std/testing/asserts.ts";

            Deno.test("Vulnerability Test", () => {
                assertEquals(1, 1);
            });
            ```

        *   Ensure you have a Deno CLI installed and accessible in your system's PATH or configured via `deno.path` setting.

    2.  **Modify Workspace Settings:**
        *   Open the workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`) or user settings.
        *   Add or modify the `deno.testing.args` setting to inject a malicious command. For example, to create a file named `injected_vuln.txt` in the workspace root, use the following JSON configuration:
            ```json
            {
                "deno.enable": true,
                "deno.testing.args": [
                    "--allow-all",
                    "; touch injected_vuln.txt"
                ]
            }
            ```
            **Note:** The `;` acts as a command separator in most shells, allowing execution of a second command after the Deno test command. `touch injected_vuln.txt` is the injected malicious command that creates an empty file.

    3.  **Execute Test via Code Lens:**
        *   Open the `test_vuln.ts` file in the editor.
        *   Locate the "▶ Run Test" code lens above the `Deno.test` declaration.
        *   Click on the "▶ Run Test" code lens. This will trigger the test execution using the Deno extension's testing feature.

    4.  **Verify Command Injection:**
        *   After running the test, check your workspace folder.
        *   **Expected Outcome:** If the command injection is successful, a new file named `injected_vuln.txt` will be present in the workspace root directory, alongside your `test_vuln.ts` file and `.vscode` folder.
        *   The presence of `injected_vuln.txt` confirms that the `touch injected_vuln.txt` command, injected via `deno.testing.args`, was executed by the system, thus proving the command injection vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates a successful command injection vulnerability in the VS Code Deno extension due to the insecure handling of the `deno.testing.args` setting.
