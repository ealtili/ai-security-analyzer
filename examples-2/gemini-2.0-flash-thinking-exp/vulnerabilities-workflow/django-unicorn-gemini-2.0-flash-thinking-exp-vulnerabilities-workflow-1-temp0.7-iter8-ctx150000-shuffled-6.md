Based on your instructions, I need to filter the provided vulnerability list.

The provided vulnerability is:

- Vulnerability Name: Information Disclosure via Error Messages in Serializer
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium

According to your instructions, I should:

**Exclude vulnerabilities that:**
- are caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns when using project from PROJECT FILES. - **Not applicable**. This vulnerability is within the django-unicorn project itself, not in user projects using it.
- are only missing documentation to mitigate. - **Not applicable**. Code changes are needed to mitigate this, not just documentation.
- are deny of service vulnerabilities. - **Not applicable**. This is an information disclosure vulnerability.

**Include only vulnerabilities that:**
- are valid and not already mitigated. - **Applicable**. The vulnerability description suggests it's valid and not yet mitigated.
- has vulnerability rank at least: high - **Not applicable**. The vulnerability rank is "Medium", which is less than "high".

Since the vulnerability rank is "Medium" and the requirement is to include only vulnerabilities with a rank of "high" or higher, this vulnerability should be excluded.

Therefore, the updated list of vulnerabilities, after applying the filters, is empty.
