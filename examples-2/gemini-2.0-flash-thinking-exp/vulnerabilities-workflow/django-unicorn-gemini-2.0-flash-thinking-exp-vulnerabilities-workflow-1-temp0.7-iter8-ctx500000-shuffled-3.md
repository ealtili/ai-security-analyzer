- Vulnerability name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsafe usage of `Meta.safe` attribute

- Description:
    - Django-unicorn allows developers to mark component attributes as `safe` using the `Meta.safe` attribute in the component's Python class.
    - When an attribute is marked as `safe`, django-unicorn will not HTML-encode its value when rendering the component, allowing raw HTML and JavaScript to be injected into the template.
    - An attacker could potentially control the value of a `safe` attribute, either directly if it's derived from user input or indirectly through other vulnerabilities.
    - By crafting a malicious string containing JavaScript code and ensuring it's assigned to a `safe` attribute, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when the component is rendered or updated.
    - Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
        1. Identify a django-unicorn component that utilizes the `Meta.safe` attribute for one or more of its properties.
        2. Find a way to influence the value of a property marked as `safe`. This could be through URL parameters, form inputs, or other means if the application logic allows it.
        3. Craft a malicious string containing JavaScript code, for example: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.
        4. Inject this malicious string as the value for the targeted `safe` property.
        5. Trigger a django-unicorn update that re-renders the component, causing the malicious JavaScript to be included in the HTML response.
        6. When a user's browser renders the updated component, the injected JavaScript code will be executed, leading to XSS.

- Impact:
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    - This can result in:
        - Session hijacking: Stealing session cookies to impersonate the user.
        - Cookie theft: Accessing sensitive information stored in cookies.
        - Redirection to malicious websites: Redirecting users to phishing sites or malware distributors.
        - Defacement: Altering the content of the web page seen by the user.
        - Data theft: Accessing sensitive data displayed on the page.
        - Actions on behalf of the user: Performing unauthorized actions as the logged-in user.

- Vulnerability rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - By default, django-unicorn HTML-encodes all component attributes to prevent XSS.
    - Developers must explicitly use `Meta.safe` to disable HTML-encoding for specific attributes. This requires conscious decision by developer to mark attribute as safe.

- Missing mitigations:
    - No mechanism to automatically sanitize "safe" attributes to prevent XSS if developer incorrectly assumes input is safe.
    - No clear warnings or security guidelines in the documentation about the risks of using `Meta.safe` and how to use it securely. While documentation mentions safe, it does not emphasize the security implications enough.

- Preconditions:
    - A django-unicorn component must be used in the application.
    - The component must have a `Meta` class defining `safe` attributes.
    - An attacker must be able to influence the value of a property that is marked as `safe` and rendered in the template.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `django-unicorn\docs\source\views.md`
        - The documentation for `Meta.safe` describes how to prevent HTML encoding for specific attributes.
        - It highlights that by default, django-unicorn encodes updated field values to prevent XSS attacks, and `Meta.safe` is an opt-in to disable this encoding.
        - This implies that any attribute listed in `Meta.safe` will be rendered directly into the HTML without sanitization, creating a potential XSS vulnerability if the developer does not ensure the content is safe.
    - File: `django-unicorn\docs\source\views.md`
        - The documentation mentions: "By default, `unicorn` HTML encodes updated field values to prevent XSS attacks. You need to explicitly opt-in to allow a field to be returned without being encoded by adding it to the `Meta` class's `safe` tuple."
        - This confirms that the `safe` attribute bypasses the default XSS protection.

- Security test case:
    - Vulnerability Test Case: XSS via `Meta.safe` attribute

    - Description:
        This test case verifies that django-unicorn components using `Meta.safe` attribute are vulnerable to XSS when a malicious string is injected into a `safe` property.

    - Steps:
        1. Create a django-unicorn component named `xss_safe_test` with a property `safe_text` and mark it as `safe` in `Meta`.
        2. In the component's template (`xss_safe_test.html`), render the `safe_text` property within a `div` tag: `<div>{{ safe_text }}</div>`.
        3. Create a view or update an existing view to include the `xss_safe_test` component.
        4. In the test function, initialize the `xss_safe_test` component and set the `safe_text` property to a malicious XSS payload, for example: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-Safe-Vulnerability')>`.
        5. Render the component using `component.render()`.
        6. Assert that the rendered HTML source code contains the raw XSS payload without HTML encoding, e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-Safe-Vulnerability')>`.
        7. Create a Django test view that renders the component.
        8. Access the view in a browser.
        9. Observe that the JavaScript code injected through `safe_text` is executed, displaying an alert box with "XSS-Safe-Vulnerability", confirming the XSS vulnerability.

- Vulnerability name: Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Insecure Deserialization in Cached Components (Requires Chaining with another vulnerability)

- Description:
    - Django-unicorn utilizes Django's caching mechanism to store component state and improve performance, especially for serialized requests.
    - The caching mechanism, as seen in `django_unicorn/cacher.py`, uses Python's `pickle` library for serialization and deserialization of component data.
    - Python's `pickle` library is known to be vulnerable to insecure deserialization. If an attacker can control the pickled data, they can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server when the data is deserialized.
    - While django-unicorn uses checksums to verify data integrity, these checksums might not be sufficient to prevent exploitation if an attacker manages to manipulate the cached data directly, bypassing the intended security measures.
    - Although direct external access to the cache backend is typically restricted, vulnerabilities in the application or infrastructure could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the cached data.
    - If an attacker can inject malicious pickled data into the cache, when `restore_from_cache` is called to retrieve and deserialize the component, the malicious payload could be executed, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    - Steps to trigger the vulnerability (Requires Chaining with another vulnerability):
        1. Identify that django-unicorn uses `pickle` for caching component state by analyzing `django_unicorn/cacher.py`.
        2. Recognize the inherent insecure deserialization vulnerability associated with Python's `pickle` library.
        3. Find or create a separate vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate the cached data used by django-unicorn. This could be a cache poisoning vulnerability, a local file inclusion vulnerability that allows overwriting the cache file (depending on the cache backend), or any other vulnerability that grants access to the cache.
        4. Craft a malicious pickled payload that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code. Tools like `pickletools` or `ysoserial` can be used for this purpose.
        5. Inject this malicious pickled payload into the django-unicorn cache, overwriting legitimate component data.
        6. Trigger a django-unicorn action that causes the application to retrieve the component from the cache using `restore_from_cache` in `django_unicorn/cacher.py`.
        7. When `pickle.loads` is called on the malicious payload within `restore_from_cache`, the injected code will be executed on the server, leading to RCE.

- Impact:
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    - An attacker can gain complete control over the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and further attacks on the infrastructure.
    - This is a critical vulnerability with severe security implications.

- Vulnerability rank: Critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Django-unicorn uses checksums to verify the integrity of cached component data.
    - The `generate_checksum` function in `django_unicorn/utils.py` creates a checksum of the component data using HMAC-SHA256 with the Django SECRET_KEY.
    - This checksum is intended to prevent tampering with the cached data.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Relying solely on checksums might not be sufficient if an attacker finds a way to manipulate the cache and update the checksum accordingly.
    - Using `pickle` for deserialization is inherently risky, even with checksums, especially when dealing with potentially untrusted data (even if indirectly).
    - No input validation or sanitization of cached data before deserialization to prevent malicious payloads.
    - No alternative, safer serialization method is offered or used for caching.

- Preconditions:
    - The `SERIAL.ENABLED` setting in django-unicorn must be set to `True`, enabling component caching.
    - A cache backend other than `django.core.cache.backends.dummy.DummyCache` must be configured.
    - An attacker needs to find and exploit a separate vulnerability that allows manipulation of the django-unicorn cache. This is an indirect precondition and requires vulnerability chaining.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `django-unicorn\django_unicorn\cacher.py`
        - The `cache_full_tree` function uses `pickle.dumps` to serialize component data before storing it in the cache.
        - The `restore_from_cache` function uses `pickle.loads` to deserialize component data retrieved from the cache.
        - The use of `pickle.loads` in `restore_from_cache` is the primary point of concern for insecure deserialization.
    - File: `django-unicorn\django_unicorn\utils.py`
        - The `generate_checksum` function is used to create a checksum of the component data, which is stored along with the pickled data.
        - This checksum is checked during deserialization to ensure data integrity, but might not prevent advanced attacks.

- Security test case:
    - Vulnerability Test Case: Potential RCE via Insecure Deserialization (Requires Chaining)

    - Description:
        This test case is designed to highlight the potential for RCE due to insecure deserialization using `pickle`, but it acknowledges that direct exploitation requires chaining with another vulnerability to manipulate the cache.  This test case focuses on demonstrating the *theoretical* vulnerability within an internal testing environment, as direct external testing is not feasible without a separate cache manipulation vulnerability.

    - Steps (Internal Testing/Proof of Concept):
        1. Set up a test environment with django-unicorn configured to use a cache backend (e.g., locmem cache) and `SERIAL.ENABLED = True`.
        2. Create a django-unicorn component that is cached.
        3. Manually craft a malicious pickled payload using `pickle.dumps`. This payload should contain code that will execute a harmless command (e.g., print a message to the console, create a temporary file) upon deserialization.
        4. Simulate a cache manipulation attack by directly inserting this malicious pickled payload into the cache using Django's cache API, using the component's cache key.
        5. Trigger a django-unicorn action that causes the component to be restored from the cache using `restore_from_cache`.
        6. Observe if the injected code from the malicious pickled payload is executed on the server when the component is deserialized. Successful execution (e.g., console message, file creation) confirms the potential for RCE.

    - Security Test Case (External - Chaining Scenario):
        1. Conduct a broader security assessment of the application and infrastructure to identify potential vulnerabilities that could allow manipulation of the django-unicorn cache. Examples include:
            - Cache poisoning vulnerabilities: If the cache keys are predictable or can be influenced, an attacker might be able to overwrite cache entries.
            - Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities: If an LFI vulnerability exists and the cache backend stores data in files, an attacker might be able to overwrite the cache files.
            - Infrastructure vulnerabilities: Weaknesses in the server or cache infrastructure that could grant access to the cache data.
        2. If a cache manipulation vulnerability is identified, chain it with the insecure deserialization vulnerability:
            - Use the identified vulnerability to inject the malicious pickled payload into the django-unicorn cache, as described in the internal test case.
            - Trigger a django-unicorn action to restore the component from the manipulated cache.
        3. Verify if the injected code is executed on the server, confirming the chained RCE vulnerability.
