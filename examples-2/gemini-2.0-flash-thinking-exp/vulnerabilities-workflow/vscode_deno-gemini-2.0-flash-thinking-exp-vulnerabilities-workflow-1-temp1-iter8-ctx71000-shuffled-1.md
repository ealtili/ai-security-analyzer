### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in tasks.json task execution
- Description:
    The VSCode Deno extension allows users to define tasks in `tasks.json`. The extension parses this file and executes the defined commands using `vscode.ProcessExecution`. If a malicious repository contains a `tasks.json` file with a crafted command, it can lead to command injection when the user executes this task.
    Step-by-step trigger:
    1. An attacker creates a malicious repository and includes a `tasks.json` file.
    2. Within `tasks.json`, the attacker defines a task where the `command` or `args` are designed to execute arbitrary commands. For example, they could use command chaining or argument injection techniques.
    3. The attacker hosts this malicious repository on a public platform (e.g., GitHub).
    4. A victim, intending to use or review code from the repository, clones or opens the malicious repository in VSCode with the Deno extension installed and enabled.
    5. The VSCode Deno extension automatically detects and registers the tasks defined in `tasks.json`.
    6. The victim, either through the tasks sidebar or by using the "Tasks: Run Task" command, selects and executes the malicious task.
    7. Upon execution, the Deno extension uses `vscode.ProcessExecution` with the attacker-controlled command and arguments.
    8. This results in the execution of arbitrary commands on the victim's machine, with the privileges of the VSCode process.

- Impact:
    Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. This can lead to full system compromise, data theft, installation of malware, or any other malicious action the attacker desires.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    No mitigations are currently implemented in the project to prevent command injection from `tasks.json`. The extension directly uses the `command` and `args` fields from `tasks.json` to construct and execute `vscode.ProcessExecution`.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Implement robust sanitization of task `command` and `args` fields read from `tasks.json`. This could involve validating commands against a whitelist of allowed commands or encoding/escaping special characters in arguments to prevent injection.
    - User Confirmation: Before executing any task defined in `tasks.json` (especially for newly added or modified tasks in a workspace), prompt the user for explicit confirmation. Display a clear warning about the potential risks of executing tasks from untrusted sources.
    - Task Definition Schema Validation: Implement a strict schema validation for `tasks.json` to limit the allowed structure and values, reducing the attack surface.

- Preconditions:
    1. The VSCode Deno extension must be installed and enabled.
    2. The victim must open a workspace or folder in VSCode that contains a malicious repository.
    3. The malicious repository must contain a `tasks.json` file crafted by the attacker with malicious commands.
    4. The victim must manually execute the malicious task, either from the tasks sidebar or using the "Tasks: Run Task" command.

- Source code analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: ..\vscode_deno\client\src\tasks.ts

    export function buildDenoTask(
      target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
      process: string,
      definition: DenoTaskDefinition, // <-- Task definition read from tasks.json
      name: string,
      args: string[], // <-- Arguments, potentially from tasks.json
      problemMatchers: string[],
    ): vscode.Task {
      const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
        process, // Deno command path (relatively safe)
        args,    // Arguments from task definition (potentially unsafe)
        definition, // Definition from tasks.json (can contain env vars)
      );

      return new vscode.Task(
        definition,
        target,
        name,
        TASK_SOURCE,
        exec,
        problemMatchers,
      );
    }
    ```
    The `buildDenoTask` function in `client\src\tasks.ts` directly uses the `DenoTaskDefinition`, which originates from parsing `tasks.json`, to construct a `vscode.ProcessExecution`. The `args` array, which is part of the `ProcessExecution`, is directly derived from the task definition and is not sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary command arguments or options.

- Security test case:
    1. Create a new directory named `malicious-repo`.
    2. Inside `malicious-repo`, create a file named `tasks.json` with the following content:
    ```json
    {
      "version": "2.0.0",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "type": "deno",
          "command": "echo",
          "args": [
            "Vulnerable",
            "&&",
            "touch",
            "pwned.txt"
          ],
          "label": "Malicious Task"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    3. Open VSCode and open the `malicious-repo` directory as a workspace. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace.
    4. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and type "Tasks: Run Task". Select this command.
    5. From the task list, select "deno: Malicious Task".
    6. After the task execution completes, check the `malicious-repo` directory. You should find a new file named `pwned.txt` created in the directory.
    7. Additionally, observe the output panel. It should display "Vulnerable" as output from the `echo` command.
    8. This confirms that the command injection is successful because the `touch pwned.txt` command, injected through `tasks.json`, was executed by the extension.
