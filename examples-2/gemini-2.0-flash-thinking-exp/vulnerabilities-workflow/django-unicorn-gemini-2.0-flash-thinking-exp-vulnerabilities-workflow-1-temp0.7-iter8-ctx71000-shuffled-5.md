### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Server-Side Template Injection via Component Arguments

- Description:
    1. An attacker can craft a malicious component name or argument in the `{% unicorn %}` template tag.
    2. When the template is rendered, the `UnicornNode.render` method in `django_unicorn/templatetags/unicorn.py` attempts to resolve the component name and arguments using Django's template variable resolution, as demonstrated in `django_unicorn\tests\views\action_parsers\call_method\test_call_method_name.py` which tests how arguments are passed to component methods.
    3. If the component name or arguments are not properly sanitized and contain template language syntax, Django's template engine might execute this syntax during rendering.
    4. This could lead to server-side template injection, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the server.

- Impact:
    - **Critical**
    - Full server compromise. An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, read sensitive data, modify data, or cause denial of service.

- Vulnerability rank:
    - Critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided files that specifically prevent server-side template injection in component names or arguments.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation of the component name and arguments passed to the `{% unicorn %}` tag.
    - Ensure that component names and arguments are treated as data and not executable code by the template engine in `UnicornNode.render`.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the component name or arguments used in the `{% unicorn %}` template tag. This could occur if the component name or arguments are dynamically generated based on user-controlled input, or if there is a vulnerability that allows template injection in other parts of the application that can be leveraged to inject malicious `{% unicorn %}` tags.

- Source code analysis:
    1. **`django_unicorn\templatetags\unicorn.py` - `UnicornNode.render` method:**
        ```python
        def render(self, context):
            # ...
            try:
                component_name = self.component_name.resolve(context) # [!] Component name is resolved using template context
            except AttributeError as e:
                raise ComponentNotValidError(f"Component template is not valid: {self.component_name}.") from e
            # ...
            resolved_args = []
            for value in self.args:
                resolved_arg = template.Variable(value).resolve(context) # [!] Arguments are resolved using template context
                resolved_args.append(resolved_arg)

            resolved_kwargs = self.kwargs.copy()
            for key, value in self.unparseable_kwargs.items():
                try:
                    resolved_value = template.Variable(value).resolve(context) # [!] Keyword arguments are resolved using template context
                    resolved_kwargs.update({key: resolved_value})
                except TypeError:
                    resolved_kwargs.update({key: value})
                except template.VariableDoesNotExist:
                    # ...
        ```
        - The code directly uses `template.Variable(value).resolve(context)` to resolve the component name, arguments, and keyword arguments.
        - If a malicious user can control the input to `component_name`, `args`, or `kwargs`, they can inject Django template language code, which will be executed during `resolve(context)`.
        - Files like `django_unicorn\tests\views\action_parsers\call_method\test_call_method_name.py` confirm the mechanism of passing arguments to component methods, which reinforces the potential attack surface for SSTI if these arguments are user-controlled and not sanitized before template resolution.

- Security test case:
    1. Create a Django template where the component name is dynamically inserted from a GET parameter.
        ```html
        {% load unicorn %}
        {% csrf_token %}
        {% unicorn component_name %}
        ```
    2. In the Django view, pass the `component_name` from the GET parameter to the template context.
        ```python
        from django.shortcuts import render

        def vulnerable_view(request):
            component_name = request.GET.get('component', 'hello-world')
            return render(request, 'vulnerable_template.html', {'component_name': component_name})
        ```
    3. Access the vulnerable view with a malicious component name that contains template code, for example: `/?component=injection_test'}}{%20import%20os%20%}{%20print(os.system('whoami'))%20%}{{'injection_test`.
    4. Observe if the command `whoami` is executed on the server. If successful, this confirms the server-side template injection vulnerability.

#### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Component Data Rendering

- Description:
    1. When a component is rendered, its public attributes are serialized into JSON and embedded in the HTML as a `script` tag with `type="application/json"`.
    2. The JavaScript code in `unicorn.js` then parses this JSON data to initialize the component state on the client-side.
    3. If the component data is not properly sanitized before being serialized into JSON and embedded in the HTML, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the component's attributes.
    4. When the HTML is rendered in the user's browser and the JavaScript parses the JSON data, the malicious JavaScript code will be executed, leading to XSS.

- Impact:
    - **High**
    - Cross-site scripting vulnerability. An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially stealing session cookies, performing actions on behalf of the user, or defacing the website.

- Vulnerability rank:
    - High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - `sanitize_html` function is used in `django_unicorn/components/unicorn_template_response.py` to sanitize the JSON data before embedding it in the `<script>` tag.
    - The changelog mentions security fix for CVE-2021-42053 to prevent XSS attacks in version v0.36.0, indicating previous awareness and mitigation attempts for XSS.

- Missing mitigations:
    - **Strengthen `sanitize_html`**: The current `sanitize_html` implementation using `html.escape` in `django_unicorn\utils.py` is insufficient. It only escapes basic HTML characters and might not prevent all types of XSS attacks. Consider using a more robust HTML sanitization library like `bleach` or `defend_your_herd`, or at least use a more comprehensive escaping function that handles JavaScript specific characters and contexts within JSON.
    - Thorough and consistent sanitization of all component data before JSON serialization.
    - Review and strengthen the `sanitize_html` function to ensure it effectively prevents all types of XSS attacks.
    - Consider using a more robust JSON serialization library that automatically escapes HTML entities, although this might not be sufficient for all XSS scenarios.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the data that is set as public attributes in a Unicorn component view. This could happen if data is directly taken from user input without sanitization and then used as a component attribute.

- Source code analysis:
    1. **`django_unicorn\components\unicorn_template_response.py` - `UnicornTemplateResponse.render` method:**
        ```python
        class UnicornTemplateResponse(TemplateResponse):
            # ...
            @timed
            def render(self):
                # ...
                frontend_context_variables = self.component.get_frontend_context_variables()
                init = {
                    "id": self.component.component_id,
                    "name": self.component.component_name,
                    "key": self.component.component_key,
                    "data": orjson.loads(frontend_context_variables), # [!] Component data is loaded
                    "calls": self.component.calls,
                    "hash": content_hash,
                }
                init = orjson.dumps(init).decode("utf-8")
                json_tag = soup.new_tag("script")
                json_tag["type"] = "application/json"
                json_tag["id"] = json_element_id
                json_tag.string = sanitize_html(init) # [!] sanitize_html is called here
                # ...
        ```
        - The `sanitize_html(init)` function is called before embedding the JSON data in the `<script>` tag.
        - However, the effectiveness of `sanitize_html` needs to be verified, and it's crucial to ensure that all component data is sanitized before being passed to this function.

    2. **`django_unicorn\utils.py` - `sanitize_html` function:**
        ```python
        def sanitize_html(value: str) -> str:
            """
            Sanitizes HTML to prevent XSS attacks.
            """

            return html.escape(value)
        ```
        - The current `sanitize_html` implementation only uses `html.escape`. While this escapes basic HTML characters, it might not be sufficient to prevent all types of XSS attacks, especially in complex scenarios or if there are vulnerabilities in the JavaScript parsing logic.

- Security test case:
    1. Create a Unicorn component with a public attribute that can be set via a URL parameter.
        ```python
        # xss_component.py
        from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

        class XSSView(UnicornView):
            vulnerable_data = ""

            def mount(self):
                self.vulnerable_data = self.component_kwargs.get('data', '')
        ```
        ```html
        <!-- xss.html -->
        <div>
            <span id="xss-data">{{ vulnerable_data }}</span>
        </div>
        ```
    2. In the Django view, pass the `data` from the GET parameter as a component kwarg.
        ```python
        from django.shortcuts import render
        from django.urls import path
        from unicorn.components.xss_component import XSSView

        def xss_view(request):
            data = request.GET.get('data', '')
            return render(request, 'xss.html', {'component': XSSView.as_view(data=data)})

        urlpatterns = [
            path('xss/', xss_view, name='xss_view'),
        ]
        ```
    3. Access the view with a malicious payload in the `data` parameter: `/xss/?data=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27XSS%27)%3C/script%3E`.
    4. Inspect the page source and verify if the `<script>` tag is embedded in the JSON data within the `<script type="application/json" id="unicorn:data:...">` tag.
    5. Observe if the `alert('XSS')` is executed when the page loads. If successful, this confirms the XSS vulnerability.

#### 3. Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `safe` Meta Attribute

- Description:
    1. The `Meta.safe` attribute in Unicorn components allows developers to explicitly mark certain component attributes as "safe," meaning they will not be HTML-encoded when rendered in templates or when serialized to JSON for JavaScript.
    2. This feature is intended for cases where developers need to render HTML content that is already considered safe, but it introduces a risk of XSS if used improperly.
    3. If a developer mistakenly marks an attribute as `safe` when it actually contains user-controlled or untrusted data, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through that attribute, leading to XSS.

- Impact:
    - **High**
    - Cross-site scripting vulnerability. Similar to vulnerability #2, but specifically related to the misusage of the `safe` meta attribute by developers.

- Vulnerability rank:
    - High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Documentation warns developers about the risks of using `safe` and advises caution.

- Missing mitigations:
    - No technical mitigations exist within `django-unicorn` to prevent developers from misusing the `safe` attribute.
    - Consider adding static analysis tools or linters to detect potential misuse of `safe` attribute, or provide clearer and stronger warnings in documentation and potentially during development.

- Preconditions:
    - A developer must explicitly use the `safe` Meta attribute for a component attribute.
    - The developer must mistakenly assume that the data in the `safe` attribute is safe when it is actually user-controlled or untrusted.

- Source code analysis:
    1. **`django_unicorn\views.py` - `UnicornView.get_frontend_context_variables` method:**
        ```python
        class UnicornView(View):
            # ...
            def get_frontend_context_variables(self) -> str:
                # ...
                for name in component_field_names:
                    value = getattr(self, name)
                    safe_fields = getattr(meta, "safe", ())

                    if name not in javascript_exclude_fields:
                        if name in safe_fields: # [!] Check if field is in safe_fields
                            serialized_value = self._serialize_value(value, safe=True) # [!] safe=True is passed
                        else:
                            serialized_value = self._serialize_value(value)
                        # ...
        ```
        - The code checks if the attribute name is in `meta.safe`. If it is, `safe=True` is passed to `_serialize_value`.
        - When `safe=True`, the value is serialized without HTML encoding, as shown in `_serialize_value` (not shown here as it's internal serialization logic).

    2. **`django_unicorn\docs\source\views.md` - Documentation for `safe` Meta attribute:**
        - The documentation explains how to use `safe` and provides a basic example.
        - It implicitly warns about the security risks, but doesn't explicitly highlight the potential for XSS if misused.

- Security test case:
    1. Create a Unicorn component and mark a public attribute as `safe` in the `Meta` class.
        ```python
        # safe_xss_component.py
        from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

        class SafeXSSView(UnicornView):
            safe_data = ""

            class Meta:
                safe = ("safe_data", ) # [!] safe_data is marked as safe
        ```
        ```html
        <!-- safe_xss.html -->
        <div>
            <span id="safe-xss-data">{{ safe_data }}</span>
        </div>
        ```
    2. In the Django view, pass user-controlled data to the `safe_data` attribute.
        ```python
        from django.shortcuts import render
        from django.urls import path
        from unicorn.components.safe_xss_component import SafeXSSView

        def safe_xss_view(request):
            data = request.GET.get('data', '')
            component = SafeXSSView()
            component.safe_data = data # [!] User controlled data is set to safe_data
            return render(request, 'safe_xss.html', {'component': component})

        urlpatterns = [
            path('safe_xss/', safe_xss_view, name='safe_xss_view'),
        ]
        ```
    3. Access the view with a malicious payload in the `data` parameter: `/safe_xss/?data=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27SafeXSS%27)%3C/script%3E`.
    4. Inspect the page source and verify if the `<script>` tag is embedded in the HTML without HTML encoding.
    5. Observe if the `alert('SafeXSS')` is executed when the page loads. If successful, this confirms the XSS vulnerability due to misuse of `safe`.

#### 4. Potential HTML Injection via Template Rendering

- Description:
    1. Unicorn uses BeautifulSoup to parse and manipulate HTML during component rendering and updates.
    2. If the component template or data used to render the template contains unescaped HTML entities or tags, and if BeautifulSoup is not configured or used correctly to handle these entities, it could lead to HTML injection vulnerabilities.
    3. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML content into the page, potentially leading to defacement, phishing attacks, or other client-side vulnerabilities.

- Impact:
    - **Medium to High**
    - HTML injection vulnerability. While typically less severe than XSS, HTML injection can still be used for defacement, phishing, and social engineering attacks. Depending on the context and injected content, it could potentially be escalated to XSS.

- Vulnerability rank:
    - High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - `html.escape` is used in `sanitize_html`, which might provide some level of HTML entity escaping, but is primarily focused on JavaScript escaping for XSS prevention in JSON data, not general HTML injection prevention in templates.

- Missing mitigations:
    - **Enforce HTML escaping in templates**: Ensure that all data rendered within component templates is properly HTML-escaped by default using Django's auto-escaping features.
    - **Template audit**: Review all existing templates (`*.html` files in components and potentially base templates) to ensure proper use of Django's template auto-escaping or explicit escaping filters (`|escape` or `{% autoescape on %}`). Pay special attention to any user-provided data rendered in templates.
    - Review BeautifulSoup configuration and usage to ensure it is set up to prevent HTML injection vulnerabilities (although template escaping should be the primary mitigation).

- Preconditions:
    - The component template must render data that is potentially user-controlled or untrusted without proper HTML escaping.

- Source code analysis:
    1. **`django_unicorn\components\unicorn_template_response.py` - `UnicornTemplateResponse.render` method:**
        ```python
        class UnicornTemplateResponse(TemplateResponse):
            # ...
            @timed
            def render(self):
                # ...
                response = super().render() # [!] Django template is rendered here
                content = response.content.decode("utf-8")
                soup = BeautifulSoup(content, features="html.parser") # [!] BeautifulSoup parses the rendered HTML
                # ...
        ```
        - `super().render()` renders the Django template using the provided context. If the template itself or the context data contains unescaped HTML, it will be rendered into the `content`.
        - BeautifulSoup then parses this potentially vulnerable HTML. If BeautifulSoup doesn't sanitize or escape HTML by default during parsing or manipulation, it could propagate HTML injection vulnerabilities.

    2. **Template Files (`*.html`):**
        - Review example templates and any template rendering user-provided data.
        - Ensure proper use of Django's template auto-escaping or explicit escaping filters (`|escape` or `{% autoescape on %}`).

- Security test case:
    1. Create a Unicorn component that renders a public attribute directly in the template without escaping.
        ```python
        # html_injection_component.py
        from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

        class HTMLInjectionView(UnicornView):
            injected_html = ""
        ```
        ```html
        <!-- html_injection.html -->
        <div>
            {{ injected_html }}  <!-- [!] Directly rendering without escaping -->
        </div>
        ```
    2. In the Django view, pass a malicious HTML payload to the `injected_html` attribute.
        ```python
        from django.shortcuts import render
        from django.urls import path
        from unicorn.components.html_injection_component import HTMLInjectionView

        def html_injection_view(request):
            payload = request.GET.get('payload', '<img src=x onerror=alert("HTMLInjection")>')
            component = HTMLInjectionView()
            component.injected_html = payload # [!] User controlled HTML is set
            return render(request, 'html_injection.html', {'component': component})

        urlpatterns = [
            path('html_injection/', html_injection_view, name='html_injection_view'),
        ]
        ```
    3. Access the view with a malicious HTML payload: `/html_injection/?payload=%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(%22HTMLInjection%22)%3E`.
    4. Observe if the `alert('HTMLInjection')` is executed, or if the `<img>` tag is rendered in a way that demonstrates HTML injection. If successful, this confirms the HTML injection vulnerability.
