### Vulnerability 1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code due to Unsanitized Text from Screenshots

- Description:
    - An attacker can create a screenshot containing malicious JavaScript code disguised as normal text.
    - The user uploads this crafted screenshot to the application.
    - The AI model processes the screenshot and, in its attempt to accurately reproduce the visual elements, includes the malicious JavaScript code from the screenshot directly into the generated HTML code.
    - Because the AI is instructed to reproduce the "exact text from the screenshot" as seen in `screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `imported_code_prompts.py` and now also in `test_prompts.py`, it may faithfully copy the malicious script into the generated code.
    - When a user deploys or previews this AI-generated code, the malicious JavaScript is executed in the user's browser.
    - This execution happens because the generated code does not sanitize or escape the text taken from the screenshot before embedding it into the HTML.

- Impact:
    - If a user deploys the generated code without reviewing it, an attacker could achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    - Successful XSS can allow the attacker to:
        - Steal user cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information.
        - Deface the website.
        - Redirect users to malicious websites.
        - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
        - Inject further malware.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. There is no code in the provided project files that sanitizes or escapes text content generated by the AI model before including it in the output HTML. The prompts explicitly instruct the AI to "Use the exact text from the screenshot" without mentioning any sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization/Escaping**: The generated code should sanitize or escape any text content derived from the screenshot before inserting it into HTML elements. This would involve encoding HTML special characters to prevent them from being interpreted as code. For example, characters like `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, and `&` should be replaced with their corresponding HTML entities (e.g., `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&#39;`, `&amp;`).
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) could limit the capabilities of injected scripts, reducing the potential damage from XSS. However, CSP is a defense-in-depth measure and not a primary mitigation for the vulnerability itself.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to create a screenshot that visually appears as normal text but contains malicious JavaScript code.
    - A user must upload this screenshot to the application and generate code.
    - The user must then deploy or preview the generated code without proper review and sanitization of the output.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **Prompts (`screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `imported_code_prompts.py`, `claude_prompts.py`, `test_prompts.py`):** These files contain system prompts for different AI models and stacks. The file `test_prompts.py` further confirms the same prompting strategy across various stacks. A common instruction across these prompts is:
        - `"Use the exact text from the screenshot."` (from `screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `imported_code_prompts.py`, `test_prompts.py` and similar in `claude_prompts.py`)
        - This instruction prioritizes visual fidelity and instructs the AI to directly use the text it detects in the screenshot. There is no instruction to sanitize or validate this text.
    - **Code Generation Flow (`evals/core.py`, `llm.py`, `generate_code.py`):**
        - The `generate_code` function in `backend/routes/generate_code.py` handles the websocket endpoint and orchestrates the code generation process.
        - It uses `create_prompt` from `backend/prompts/__init__.py` to assemble prompts based on input and stack.
        - It then interacts with LLMs using functions like `stream_openai_response` or `stream_claude_response` from `llm.py`.
        - The responses from the AI models are processed by `extract_html_content` to extract HTML, but there is **no sanitization or escaping of text content** at any point in the `generate_code.py` file or in the overall code generation flow. The generated code is directly sent back to the frontend via websocket.
    - **Lack of Sanitization:**
        - Review of `generate_code.py` confirms that there is no function or logic implemented to sanitize or escape user-provided text before it is incorporated into the generated code. The focus remains on visual accuracy and code generation based on prompts, without considering security sanitization of text from screenshots.
    - **Visualization:**
        ```
        User Screenshot (Malicious Text as Javascript) --> [Screenshot-to-Code Backend] --> AI Model (Processes Screenshot and Prompts) --> Generated Code (Includes Unsanitized Malicious Javascript) --> User Deploys Code --> XSS Vulnerability
        ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a Malicious Screenshot:** Create a screenshot image using any image editor or by taking a screenshot of a webpage. In this screenshot, include text that is actually a JavaScript payload, for example: `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')">`. Ensure this is rendered as text in the image.
    2. **Start the Application:** Run the `screenshot-to-code` application locally as described in the `README.md`.
    3. **Navigate to the Frontend:** Open the frontend in a web browser (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
    4. **Upload the Malicious Screenshot:** Use the application's interface to upload the screenshot you created in step 1.
    5. **Select Stack and Generate Code:** Choose any supported stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind) and initiate the code generation process.
    6. **Download or Preview Generated Code:** Once the code is generated, download it as an HTML file or use the preview feature if available in the frontend.
    7. **Open the Generated HTML in a Browser:** Open the downloaded HTML file in a web browser or preview it directly in the application if it supports preview.
    8. **Verify XSS Execution:** Check if the JavaScript code from your screenshot is executed. In this example, you should see an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability!".
    9. **Inspect Source Code:** If the alert box appears, inspect the source code of the HTML page in the browser's developer tools. You should find the malicious JavaScript code injected directly into the HTML, confirming that the AI has included it verbatim from the screenshot without sanitization.

- Vulnerability Remediation:
    - Implement server-side sanitization of the text extracted by the AI before including it in the generated code. Use a library suitable for HTML escaping in Python on the backend before serving the generated code to the user.
    - Educate users about the importance of reviewing and sanitizing AI-generated code before deployment. Add warnings in the UI about potential security vulnerabilities.
    - Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the risk of XSS, although this is a secondary defense.

### Vulnerability 2: Inclusion of Potentially Malicious or Outdated CDN Links in AI-Generated Code

- Description:
    - The system prompts (e.g., `imported_code_prompts.py`, `screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `test_prompts.py`) instruct the AI to include specific CDN links for popular libraries like Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, React, Vue, Ionic, Font Awesome, and Google Fonts. The file `test_prompts.py` also demonstrates these CDN links in prompts for various stacks.
    - While these are generally reputable CDNs, there are potential risks:
        - **Compromised CDN**: In a highly unlikely but severe scenario, a CDN itself could be compromised and serve malicious files, leading to compromised websites using these links.
        - **Outdated Libraries with Known Vulnerabilities**: The AI might include links to outdated versions of libraries that contain known security vulnerabilities. For instance, older versions of jQuery have had XSS vulnerabilities. If the AI model consistently generates code with outdated jQuery CDN links, it introduces vulnerabilities.
        - **Substitution/Manipulation**: Although less likely given current models, in a future scenario, a sophisticated attacker might attempt to subtly influence the AI model (e.g., through prompt injection or adversarial examples, though not directly evident as an attack vector in the provided files) to replace legitimate CDN links with malicious ones, especially if the prompts are not strictly controlled.
    - If the AI generates code with these compromised or vulnerable CDN links, any user deploying this code will unknowingly introduce these vulnerabilities into their project.

- Impact:
    - Users who deploy AI-generated code without carefully reviewing the included CDN links could be vulnerable to attacks.
    - Including outdated libraries can directly introduce known vulnerabilities, such as XSS or other client-side exploits present in older versions of JavaScript libraries.
    - In a CDN compromise scenario, the impact could be widespread, affecting all users of the generated code and potentially beyond if the CDN is widely used.

- Vulnerability Rank: Medium (due to lower likelihood but potentially high impact if exploited at scale or if outdated vulnerable libraries are consistently included)

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided code. The prompts directly instruct the AI to include specific CDN links without any validation, version control, or integrity checks on these resources.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **CDN Link Validation and Curations**: The application should not directly rely on AI to choose CDN links. Instead:
        - **Whitelist and Curate CDN Links**: Maintain a curated whitelist of known, secure CDN links for libraries. The prompts should be updated to instruct the AI to choose from this curated list rather than freely generating or selecting links.
        - **Specify Library Versions**: Where possible, use specific versioned CDN links (e.g., `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com/v3.0.0/tailwind.min.css` instead of just `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com`). This helps to ensure more predictable and potentially more secure dependencies.
        - **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**: Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for all included CDN links. SRI allows the browser to verify that files fetched from CDNs haven't been tampered with. This involves generating a cryptographic hash of the expected CDN file and including it in the `<link>` or `<script>` tag. For example: `<script src="https://cdn.example.com/library.js" integrity="sha384-hash-value" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`.
    - **Regularly Audit and Update CDN Links**: Periodically review the CDN links used in prompts and in generated code to ensure they are still secure, up-to-date, and point to the intended versions of libraries.

- Preconditions:
    - The AI model, following the prompts, must include CDN links in the generated code.
    - Either a CDN is actually compromised (less likely), or the AI model consistently selects outdated CDN links that point to vulnerable library versions (more likely).
    - Users deploy the generated code without reviewing and replacing the CDN links.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **Prompts (`screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `imported_code_prompts.py`, `claude_prompts.py`, `test_prompts.py`):**
        - These prompt files, including `test_prompts.py`, explicitly list CDN links for inclusion in the generated code. For example, `IMPORTED_CODE_TAILWIND_SYSTEM_PROMPT` and `TAILWIND_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `test_prompts.py` includes:
            ```
            - Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
            - Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
            ```
        - Similarly, `BOOTSTRAP_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `test_prompts.py` includes a specific versioned Bootstrap CDN link but still lacks SRI:
            ```
            - Use this script to include Bootstrap: <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-T3c6CoIi6uLrA9TneNEoa7RxnatzjcDSCmG1MXxSR1GAsXEV/Dwwykc2MPK8M2HN" crossorigin="anonymous">
            ```
        - Similar links are present for React, Vue, Ionic, and other stacks in `test_prompts.py` and other prompt files.
        - The prompts instruct the AI to *use* these links, without any safeguards against using outdated or potentially manipulated links, except for the Bootstrap link in `test_prompts.py` which uses integrity attribute, but this is not consistently applied across all CDN links and stacks.
    - **Code Generation Flow (`evals/core.py`, `llm.py`, `generate_code.py`):**
        - The code generation process, as analyzed for XSS, focuses on getting code from the AI model based on the prompts. The `generate_code.py` file confirms that the generated code from the AI is directly passed to the frontend. There is no stage where CDN links are validated, checked for versions (except partially for Bootstrap in prompts), or replaced with curated secure links within the backend code.
    - **No CDN Management:**
        - The provided backend code, including `generate_code.py`, does not contain any logic to manage or validate CDN links. It trusts the AI model's output to include these links as instructed in the prompts.

- Security Test Case (Demonstration of Risk, not direct exploit of current code):
    1. **Modify Prompts (for demonstration):** To demonstrate the risk, although direct manipulation might not be easily achievable in the current setup without modifying the backend or prompt injection, we can *theoretically* demonstrate the risk. If we could hypothetically modify the prompts (e.g., for testing purposes) to instruct the AI to use a deliberately outdated or known-vulnerable CDN for jQuery (e.g., a very old version of jQuery known to have XSS flaws), or a *mock* CDN URL we control that serves a file with a simple `alert('Vulnerable CDN!')` inside instead of the real library.
    2. **Generate Code:** Using the modified prompt (or if we could somehow achieve prompt injection to subtly alter the AI's CDN link choice - though not evident as a direct vulnerability in the provided files), generate code for any stack that uses jQuery or a similar library via CDN.
    3. **Inspect Generated Code:** Examine the generated code to confirm that it includes the modified, outdated, or malicious CDN link we intended to inject (or simulate injecting via prompt modification).
    4. **Open Generated HTML in Browser:** Open the generated HTML file in a browser.
    5. **Verify Vulnerability/Malicious Behavior:**
        - If we used a mock CDN serving `alert('Vulnerable CDN!')`, we should see the alert, demonstrating that the injected CDN script is executed.
        - If we used an outdated jQuery with a known XSS vulnerability, we could then attempt to exploit that known vulnerability in a separate step (this might be more complex to demonstrate directly within this test case but shows the *potential* risk if outdated libs are used).

    **Note:** Directly "exploiting" this in the current project setup without code modification is not straightforward as it assumes influencing the AI's CDN link generation, which is more of a *potential* risk based on how prompts are designed and AI models could behave. The test case is more about demonstrating the *risk* if the AI were to include bad CDN links due to prompt manipulation or other factors, and the lack of mitigation for this in the project.

- Vulnerability Remediation:
    - Implement CDN link curation and validation as described in "Missing Mitigations".
    - Preferentially use specific versioned CDN links with SRI hashes in the prompts.
    - Regularly audit and update the CDN links in prompts and encourage users to review and potentially host critical libraries locally or use package managers for better dependency management in production environments if they require higher security.
