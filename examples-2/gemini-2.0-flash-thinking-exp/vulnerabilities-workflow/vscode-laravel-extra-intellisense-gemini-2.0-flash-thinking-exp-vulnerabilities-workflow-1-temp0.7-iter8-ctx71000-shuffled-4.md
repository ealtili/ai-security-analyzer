### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `phpCommand` configuration
- Description:
    1. The VSCode extension "Laravel Extra Intellisense" uses the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting from the user's workspace configuration to execute PHP code.
    2. This setting is intended to allow users to customize the PHP command used by the extension, especially when using Docker or other development environments.
    3. The extension's code in `src/helpers.ts` directly substitutes the `{code}` placeholder in the `phpCommand` string with the PHP code to be executed and then uses `child_process.exec` to run this command as a shell command.
    4. A malicious user can craft a workspace configuration (e.g., in `.vscode/settings.json` within a Git repository) that sets `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` to inject arbitrary shell commands.
    5. When a victim opens this malicious workspace in VSCode with the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension enabled and the extension attempts to provide autocompletion, it will execute the attacker-controlled `phpCommand`, leading to command injection.

- Impact:
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the same privileges as the VSCode process running the extension.
    - This can lead to complete compromise of the victim's local system, including data theft, malware installation, and further attacks.

- Vulnerability Rank: critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly uses the `phpCommand` setting from the workspace configuration without any sanitization or validation.
    - The README.md contains a "Security Note" that advises users to be cautious about sensitive code in service providers, but it does not explicitly warn about command injection vulnerabilities via `phpCommand` configuration.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of the `phpCommand` setting. However, proper sanitization of shell commands is complex and might be bypassed.
    - Restricting the allowed characters or commands in `phpCommand`. Ideally, the extension should only allow the `php` command and its legitimate arguments, preventing execution of other arbitrary commands.
    - Displaying a prominent warning in the extension's settings UI about the security risks of modifying the `phpCommand` setting and advising users to only use trusted configurations.
    - Considering alternative methods to execute Laravel code that do not involve shell commands, if feasible.

- Preconditions:
    - The victim must open a workspace in VSCode that contains a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file (provided by the attacker, e.g., through a cloned Git repository) or manually configure the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting to a malicious command.
    - The "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension must be activated in VSCode.
    - The workspace must be a Laravel project for the extension to attempt to run Laravel commands.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `src/helpers.ts`
    ```typescript
    static async runPhp(code: string, description: string|null = null) : Promise<string> {
        code = code.replace(/\"/g, "\\\""); // This is insufficient escaping for shell commands
        if (['linux', 'openbsd', 'sunos', 'darwin'].some(unixPlatforms => os.platform().includes(unixPlatforms))) {
            code = code.replace(/\$/g, "\\$");
            code = code.replace(/\\\\'/g, '\\\\\\\\\'');
            code = code.replace(/\\\\"/g, '\\\\\\\\\"');
        }
        let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
        let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);
        let out = new Promise<string>(function (resolve, error) {
            cp.exec(command,
                { cwd: vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders && vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders.length > 0 ? vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0].uri.fsPath : undefined },
                function (err, stdout, stderr) { // Vulnerable function: cp.exec() executes shell command
                    if (err == null) {
                        if (description != null) {
                            Helpers.outputChannel?.info("Laravel Extra Intellisense Resolved: " + description);
                        }
                        resolve(stdout);
                    } else {
                        const errorOutput = stderr.length > 0 ? stderr : stdout;
                        Helpers.outputChannel?.error("Laravel Extra Intellisense Error:\n " + (description ?? '') + '\n\n' + errorOutput);
                        Helpers.showErrorPopup();
                        error(errorOutput);
                    }
                }
            );
        });
        return out;
    }
    ```
    - The `runPhp` function retrieves the `phpCommand` from the user configuration.
    - It uses `commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code)` to construct the final command string.
    - `cp.exec(command, ...)` executes the constructed command as a shell command, making it vulnerable to command injection if `phpCommand` is maliciously crafted.

- Security test case:
    1. Prerequisites:
        - VSCode with "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension installed.
        - A local Laravel project (can be a basic project created with `laravel new project-name`).
    2. Malicious Workspace Configuration:
        - Navigate to the root directory of your Laravel project in VSCode.
        - Create or modify the `.vscode/settings.json` file in the project root.
        - Add the following JSON configuration to `.vscode/settings.json`:
          ```json
          {
              "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "echo '; touch /tmp/pwned_laravel_intellisense; php -r \\\"{code}\\\""
          }
          ```
          This malicious command will first execute `echo '; touch /tmp/pwned_laravel_intellisense; php -r \"{code}\"'` which due to the way `exec` and shell parsing works, will execute `touch /tmp/pwned_laravel_intellisense` and then attempt to execute `php -r "{code}"`.
    3. Trigger Extension Autocompletion:
        - Open any PHP file (e.g., a controller or route file) or a Blade template file within the Laravel project in VSCode.
        - Start typing code that would trigger the Laravel Extra Intellisense autocompletion (e.g., `Route::`, `config(`, `view(`). This will cause the extension to execute PHP code using the configured `phpCommand`.
    4. Verify Command Injection:
        - After triggering the autocompletion, check if the file `/tmp/pwned_laravel_intellisense` has been created in the `/tmp/` directory of your system.
        - On Linux or macOS, you can use the command `ls -l /tmp/pwned_laravel_intellisense` in the terminal. If the file exists, it confirms that the `touch /tmp/pwned_laravel_intellisense` command injected via `phpCommand` was successfully executed, demonstrating command injection.
    5. Cleanup:
        - Delete the `/tmp/pwned_laravel_intellisense` file using `rm /tmp/pwned_laravel_intellisense`.
        - Remove or modify the malicious `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting from `.vscode/settings.json` to prevent further exploitation.

This test case demonstrates that a malicious user can achieve command injection and arbitrary code execution by providing a crafted `phpCommand` configuration within a workspace that a victim opens in VSCode with the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension installed.
