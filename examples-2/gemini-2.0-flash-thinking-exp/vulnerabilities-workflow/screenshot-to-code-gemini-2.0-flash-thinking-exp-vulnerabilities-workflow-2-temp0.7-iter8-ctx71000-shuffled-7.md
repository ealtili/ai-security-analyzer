- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in AI-Generated Code
- Description:
  - The application uses AI models to generate code from screenshots and mockups.
  - The AI-generated code, particularly HTML and JavaScript, may contain Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if not properly sanitized or if the input screenshot contains malicious elements that are misinterpreted by the AI as valid code.
  - An attacker could craft a malicious screenshot or mockup containing embedded JavaScript code.
  - When the user uploads this malicious screenshot, the AI model might interpret the malicious JavaScript as part of the design and include it in the generated code.
  - If a user then deploys or uses this AI-generated code without careful review and sanitization, the malicious JavaScript could be executed in the browsers of users who access the deployed application.
  - For example, the AI might generate code like this if the input screenshot contains text resembling a script tag:
    ```html
    <div>
      <p>Some text</p>
      <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>
    </div>
    ```
  - If this code is rendered in a browser, the JavaScript `alert("XSS Vulnerability");` will be executed, demonstrating an XSS vulnerability.
- Impact:
  - If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
  - This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing sensitive user data (cookies, session tokens, personal information).
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.
    - Deploying further attacks against the user's system.
- Vulnerability Rank: Medium
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - No specific sanitization or encoding of the AI-generated code is implemented in the project.
  - The `README.md` (not provided in PROJECT FILES, but mentioned in previous analysis) mentions that users should perform a thorough security review of the generated code, but this is a user responsibility and not a technical mitigation within the project itself. The provided files (`generate_code.py`, `utils.py`, `screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `llm.py`) do not contain any code related to output sanitization or Content Security Policy.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Output Sanitization:** Implement server-side or client-side sanitization of the AI-generated code before presenting it to the user. This should involve encoding HTML entities and removing or neutralizing potentially malicious JavaScript code. Libraries like DOMPurify (client-side JavaScript) or bleach (Python) could be used for sanitization.
  - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which scripts can be executed, reducing the impact of XSS attacks.
  - **User Education:** Clearly warn users about the potential security risks of using AI-generated code without thorough review and sanitization. Emphasize the importance of manual security audits before deploying the generated code.
- Preconditions:
  - An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious screenshot or mockup that tricks the AI model into generating code with embedded JavaScript.
  - A user must then use the AI-generated code without performing a security review and deploy it in an environment accessible to other users.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - **File: `..\screenshot-to-code\backend\routes\generate_code.py`**: This file handles the core logic of generating code. It receives user requests, calls AI models via functions in `llm.py`, and sends the generated code back to the client.
    - The function `stream_code` in `generate_code.py` is the entry point for code generation requests.
    - It calls `create_prompt` to prepare prompts for the AI model.
    - It uses functions from `llm.py` (e.g., `stream_openai_response`, `stream_claude_response`) to get code completions from AI models.
    - The generated code is then post-processed using `extract_html_content` from `utils.py`.
    - **Crucially, there is no sanitization of the generated code within `generate_code.py` or in the `extract_html_content` function.** The raw output from the AI model, after extracting HTML content, is directly sent back to the user.
  - **File: `..\screenshot-to-code\backend\utils.py`**: This file contains utility functions, including `extract_html_content` and `pprint_prompt`.
    - The `extract_html_content` function uses regular expressions to extract HTML content from a string. This function does not perform any sanitization; it only extracts content.
    - The `pprint_prompt` and `truncate_data_strings` functions are for debugging and logging and do not relate to security.
  - **File: `..\screenshot-to-code\backend\prompts\screenshot_system_prompts.py`**: This file defines system prompts for different tech stacks.
    - These prompts instruct the AI models to generate code based on screenshots.
    - The prompts focus on functional and visual aspects of the code generation, such as matching the screenshot's layout, colors, and text.
    - **There are no instructions in these prompts to generate secure code or to avoid including potentially malicious content.** The focus is solely on replicating the visual design from the screenshot in code.
  - **File: `..\screenshot-to-code\backend\llm.py`**: This file contains functions to interact with Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini.
    - Functions like `stream_openai_response`, `stream_claude_response`, and `stream_gemini_response` handle communication with the respective AI APIs.
    - These functions send prompts to the AI models and stream back the responses.
    - **These functions do not include any logic to sanitize or validate the AI-generated code.** They are designed to fetch and stream the raw output from the LLMs.
  - **Visualization:**
    ```
    [User Uploads Screenshot] --> [Backend Receives Screenshot] --> [AI Model (OpenAI/Claude)] --> [AI Generates Code (potentially with malicious JS)] --> [Backend Returns Code to Frontend (NO SANITIZATION)] --> [User Copies/Uses Code] --> [Vulnerable Application if deployed without sanitization]
    ```
- Security Test Case:
  1. **Prepare a Malicious Screenshot:** Create a simple image. Embed the following text within the image as if it were part of the design: `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability Test");</script>`. Ensure this text is visually integrated into the screenshot.
  2. **Upload the Malicious Screenshot:** Access the screenshot-to-code application (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). Upload the prepared malicious screenshot using the application's interface. Select any supported stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind).
  3. **Generate Code:** Initiate the code generation process by clicking the button to generate code.
  4. **Review Generated Code:** Once the AI model generates the code, examine the output in the application. Check if the injected JavaScript code `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability Test");</script>` or similar script is present within the generated HTML.
  5. **Execute Generated Code:** Copy the generated HTML code from the application. Create a new HTML file named `test_xss.html` and paste the copied code into this file. Open `test_xss.html` in a web browser.
  6. **Verify XSS:** Observe if an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability Test" appears when you open `test_xss.html` in the browser. If the alert box appears, it confirms the presence of the XSS vulnerability in the AI-generated code, as the embedded JavaScript from the screenshot has been executed.
