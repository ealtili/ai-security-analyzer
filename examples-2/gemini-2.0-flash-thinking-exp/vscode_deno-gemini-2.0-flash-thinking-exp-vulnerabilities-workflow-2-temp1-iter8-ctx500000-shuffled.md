## Combined Vulnerability List

### Task Command Injection via Malicious Workspace Configuration

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious workspace containing a `tasks.json` or `deno.json`/`deno.jsonc` file.
    2. This file defines a Deno task with a malicious command or arguments.
    3. A victim opens this malicious workspace in VS Code with the Deno extension enabled.
    4. The Deno extension reads the task definitions from the workspace configuration files.
    5. The victim, either intentionally or accidentally (e.g., by clicking "Run Task" in the sidebar or using a keyboard shortcut), triggers the execution of the malicious task.
    6. The Deno extension executes the task using `vscode.tasks.executeTask`, which runs the attacker-defined command within the victim's VS Code environment.

- Impact:
    - **High**: Arbitrary command execution within the user's VS Code environment. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
        - Data exfiltration: Stealing sensitive files or environment variables.
        - Code modification: Injecting malicious code into the user's projects.
        - System compromise: If the VS Code environment has sufficient permissions, the attacker could potentially gain control over the user's system.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None explicitly identified in the provided project files. The extension relies on the user to only open trusted workspaces.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input validation and sanitization:** The extension should validate and sanitize task definitions from workspace configuration files to prevent command injection. This includes:
        -  Whitelisting allowed commands and arguments.
        -  Escaping or quoting command arguments to prevent injection.
        -  Restricting the use of shell commands or features that could be exploited.
    - **User confirmation:** Before executing tasks defined in workspace configuration, especially for new or untrusted workspaces, the extension should prompt the user for confirmation, clearly displaying the command to be executed.
    - **Principle of least privilege:** The extension itself and the tasks it executes should operate with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

- Preconditions:
    1. Victim has the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension installed and enabled.
    2. Victim opens a malicious workspace containing crafted `tasks.json` or `deno.json`/`deno.jsonc` files.
    3. Victim triggers the execution of the malicious task defined in the workspace configuration.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **`client\src\tasks.ts`:**
        - `DenoTaskDefinition` interface and `buildDenoTask` function are used to define and construct tasks based on configuration.
        - `ProcessExecution` is used to execute tasks, directly using user-provided `command` and `args`. No sanitization or validation is apparent in this code.
    - **`client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`:**
        -  `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider` reads tasks from `deno.json`/`deno.jsonc` via LSP requests (`taskReq`).
        -  Tasks are executed using `tasks.executeTask(task.task)` in `#runTask` and `#runSelectedTask` methods, after being built by `buildDenoConfigTask` which ultimately relies on `buildDenoTask` from `tasks.ts`.
    - **`client\src\commands.ts`:**
        - `test` command handler in `commands.ts` shows how `DenoTaskDefinition` can be created with potentially user-controlled `testArgs`, `env`, and other settings. While this specific command is for testing, it illustrates the pattern of creating tasks based on configurations without explicit sanitization of command components.

        A[Malicious Workspace (tasks.json/deno.json)] --> B(VS Code Deno Extension);
        B --> C{Read Task Definitions};
        C --> D[DenoTaskDefinition (Malicious Command/Args)];
        D --> E(vscode.tasks.executeTask);
        E --> F[System Command Execution];
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a new folder named `malicious-deno-workspace`.
        - Inside `malicious-deno-workspace`, create a `.vscode` folder.
        - Inside `.vscode`, create a `tasks.json` file with the malicious content (see original description).
        - Ensure a Deno project is enabled in VS Code.
    2. **Execution:**
        - Open the `malicious-deno-workspace` folder in VS Code.
        - Open the Command Palette and select "Tasks: Run Task".
        - Choose "deno: Malicious Task".
    3. **Verification:**
        - Observe if the malicious script executed (check output panel and for side effects like file creation).


### Command Injection in `deno.testing.args`

- Description:
    1.  The Visual Studio Code Deno extension allows users to configure test arguments via the `deno.testing.args` setting.
    2.  This setting is intended to provide additional arguments to the Deno CLI test command.
    3.  However, the extension does not properly sanitize or validate these arguments.
    4.  An attacker can modify the `deno.testing.args` setting in the workspace or user settings to inject arbitrary shell commands.
    5.  When the extension executes tests, it uses the Deno CLI and includes the attacker-controlled arguments from `deno.testing.args` directly in the command.
    6.  This results in the injected shell commands being executed by the system.

- Impact:
    *   **Critical**: Successful command injection can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the user running VS Code.
    *   Attackers could potentially steal sensitive data, install malware, modify system configurations, or perform other malicious actions.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    *   **None**: The code directly uses the arguments from the `deno.testing.args` setting without any sanitization or validation.

- Missing Mitigations:
    *   **Input Sanitization**: The extension should sanitize the `deno.testing.args` setting to prevent command injection.
    *   **Warning to User**: When using `deno.testing.args`, a security warning should be displayed to the user about the risks of command injection.

- Preconditions:
    1.  User has the Visual Studio Code Deno extension installed and enabled.
    2.  User has Deno CLI installed and configured for use with the extension.
    3.  Attacker can persuade the user to modify the `deno.testing.args` setting in their user or workspace settings.

- Source Code Analysis:

    1.  **File: `client/src/commands.ts` - `test` function:**
        ```typescript
        export function test( ... ): Callback {
          return async (uriStr: string, name: string, options: TestCommandOptions) => {
            const config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS, uri);
            const testArgs: string[] = [
              ...(config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs") ?? []), // <-- Vulnerable setting is read here
            ];
            const args = ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", nameRegex, filePath];
            const definition: tasks.DenoTaskDefinition = { args };
            const denoCommand = await getDenoCommandName();
            const task = tasks.buildDenoTask( workspaceFolder, denoCommand, definition, `test "${name}"`, args, ["$deno-test"], );
            return createdTask;
          };
        }
        ```
        **Visualization:**

        ```
        [VS Code Setting: deno.testing.args] --> (config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs")) --> testArgs: string[] --> args: string[] = ["test", ...testArgs, ...] --> definition: tasks.DenoTaskDefinition = { args } --> buildDenoTask(..., args) --> vscode.ProcessExecution(denoCommand, args) --> System Command Execution
        ```

    2.  **File: `client/src/tasks.ts` - `buildDenoTask` function:**
        ```typescript
        export function buildDenoTask( ... args: string[], ... ): vscode.Task {
          const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution( process, args, definition, );
          return new vscode.Task( definition, target, name, TASK_SOURCE, exec, problemMatchers, );
        }
        ```

    **Explanation:**
    The code clearly shows that the `deno.testing.args` setting is read and directly used to construct the arguments for the Deno CLI command. No input validation or sanitization is performed.

- Security Test Case:
    1.  **Setup:**
        -   Open Visual Studio Code, install Deno extension, open workspace.
        -   Create `test_vuln.ts` file.
    2.  **Modify Workspace Settings:**
        -   Open workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`).
        -   Add or modify the `deno.testing.args` setting to inject a malicious command (e.g., `; touch injected_vuln.txt`).
    3.  **Execute Test via Code Lens:**
        -   Open `test_vuln.ts`, click "â–¶ Run Test" code lens.
    4.  **Verify Command Injection:**
        -   Check workspace folder.
        -   **Expected Outcome:** `injected_vuln.txt` file will be present, confirming command injection.


### Command Injection in Deno Upgrade via Malicious `latestVersion`

- Description:
    1. The VSCode Deno extension prompts users to upgrade Deno when a new version is available.
    2. The extension uses the `deno upgrade` command to perform the upgrade.
    3. The target version for the upgrade (`latestVersion`) is obtained from the Deno Language Server in a `deno/didUpgradeCheck` notification.
    4. If the Deno Language Server is compromised or manipulated to return a maliciously crafted `latestVersion` string, this string is directly used as an argument to the `deno upgrade --version` command.
    5. By crafting a `latestVersion` string containing shell command injection payloads, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the user's system when the user attempts to upgrade Deno through the extension.

- Impact:
    Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the user running VSCode.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None in the provided code.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization: Validate `latestVersion` string.
    - Command construction: Use safer method of passing version to Deno CLI.

- Preconditions:
    1. The user must have the VSCode Deno extension installed and enabled.
    2. The Deno Language Server must be configured.
    3. Attacker must compromise Deno Language Server to send malicious `deno/didUpgradeCheck`.
    4. User must choose to upgrade Deno.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `client/src/upgrade.ts`
    - Function: `denoUpgradePromptAndExecute`

    ```typescript
    export async function denoUpgradePromptAndExecute( { latestVersion, isCanary }: UpgradeAvailable, ) {
      const args = ["upgrade", "--version", latestVersion]; // [!] Vulnerable line: latestVersion directly used
      const definition: tasks.DenoTaskDefinition = { type: tasks.TASK_TYPE, command: "upgrade", args }; // [!] args contains unsanitized latestVersion
      const task = tasks.buildDenoTask( workspaceFolder, denoCommand, definition, "upgrade", args, ["$deno"], ); // [!] args passed to task execution
      await vscode.tasks.executeTask(task); // [!] Task executed with potential injection
    }
    ```

    **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Deno Language Server (Compromised)] --> B(Send "deno/didUpgradeCheck" with malicious latestVersion);
        B --> C[VSCode Deno Extension (client/src/upgrade.ts:denoUpgradePromptAndExecute)];
        C --> D{Prompt Upgrade?};
        D -- Yes --> E(Construct "deno upgrade" with malicious latestVersion);
        E --> F(vscode.tasks.executeTask(task));
        F --> G[System Shell];
        G --> H{Arbitrary Code Execution};
    ```

    **Step-by-step vulnerability breakdown:**
    1. Compromised Deno Language Server sends `deno/didUpgradeCheck` with malicious `latestVersion` (e.g., `"1.23.4 && malicious_command"`).
    2. `denoUpgradePromptAndExecute` receives malicious `latestVersion`.
    3. Function constructs `args` array with unsanitized `latestVersion`: `args.push(latestVersion);`.
    4. `DenoTaskDefinition` created with malicious `args`.
    5. `vscode.Task` built and executed using `vscode.tasks.executeTask(task)`.
    6. Shell executes `deno upgrade` and attacker's malicious command.
    7. Arbitrary code execution occurs.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Mock Deno Language Server to send `deno/didUpgradeCheck` with malicious `latestVersion` (e.g., `"1.23.4 && echo 'Vulnerable' > /tmp/vuln.txt"`).
    2. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Open VSCode with Deno extension and mock LSP.
        - Wait for upgrade prompt, click "Upgrade".
    3. **Verify Impact:**
        - Check for execution of injected command (e.g., verify `/tmp/vuln.txt` creation).

### Malicious Deno Executable Path Configuration

- Description:
    1. An attacker social engineers a user to change the `deno.path` setting in VSCode to point to a malicious executable.
    2. The user is tricked into setting `deno.path` to point to a malicious executable.
    3. The user reloads VSCode or restarts the Deno extension.
    4. The Deno extension reads the `deno.path` setting and attempts to execute the specified path as the Deno CLI.
    5. Because `deno.path` points to the malicious executable, the attacker's code is executed.

- Impact: Arbitrary code execution.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. Extension checks file existence but not legitimacy.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Path validation: Validate `deno.path` setting (check for legitimate Deno CLI executable).
    - User warning: Warn users if `deno.path` is changed to an unusual path.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension installed.
    - Attacker social engineers user into modifying `deno.path` setting.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `client/src/util.ts`
        - Function: `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` - retrieves `deno.path` setting without validation.
        - Function: `getDenoCommandPath()` - calls `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`, checks file existence but not legitimacy.

        ```
        [VSCode Configuration] ----> getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() ----> getDenoCommandPath() ----> [Deno Extension execution]
                         ^
                         |
                       deno.path setting (user-controlled, no validation)
        ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup:
        - Create a malicious executable file (e.g., `malicious_deno.sh` or `malicious_deno.bat`).
    2. VSCode Configuration:
        - Open VSCode Settings and set `deno.path` to the malicious executable.
    3. Trigger Extension Execution:
        - Reload VSCode or restart Deno extension.
        - Open any JS/TS file.
    4. Verification:
        - Check for execution of malicious code (e.g., verify creation of log file `attack_log.txt`).

### Path Traversal in `deno.path` setting

- Description:
    1. An attacker modifies VS Code workspace settings, setting `deno.path` in `.vscode/settings.json` with path traversal sequences (e.g., `"../../../path/to/malicious_script.js"`).
    2. When the extension activates, it reads `deno.path` setting.
    3. Extension uses `getDenoCommandPath` function, resolving relative paths using `path.resolve` without sanitization.
    4. Resolved path points to attacker-controlled script outside workspace.
    5. Extension executes attacker-specified malicious script instead of Deno CLI.

- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. Extension does not sanitize `deno.path`.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Sanitize `deno.path` to remove path traversal sequences.
    - Path validation: Validate resolved path is within trusted directory or workspace.
    - User warning: Warn user if `deno.path` is outside workspace or standard Deno installation directory.

- Preconditions:
    - Attacker can influence VS Code workspace settings (e.g., malicious `.vscode/settings.json`).
    - Deno VS Code extension enabled.

- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: client/src/util.ts
    async function getDenoCommandPath() {
      const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
      if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
        for (const workspace of workspaceFolders) {
          const commandPath = path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command); // Potential Path Traversal
          if (await fileExists(commandPath)) {
            return commandPath;
          }
        }
      } else {
        return command;
      }
    }
    ```
    - `path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command)` resolves relative `deno.path` without sanitization.
    - Attacker can use path traversal in `deno.path` to point outside workspace.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create `malicious.js` outside workspace (e.g., in home directory) to read sensitive file and log execution.
    2. Create/open VS Code workspace.
    3. In `.vscode/settings.json`, set `deno.path` to malicious script using path traversal (e.g., `"../../../malicious.js"`).
    4. Open JS/TS file to activate extension.
    5. Observe output in "Output" panel ("Deno Language Server") and check for malicious script execution (sensitive file read, log message).

### Import Map Redirection to Malicious Code Execution

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious `import_map.json` file with mappings redirecting legitimate modules to attacker-controlled locations hosting malicious code.
    2. Attacker creates a VS Code workspace and places malicious `import_map.json`.
    3. Attacker entices victim to open workspace in VS Code with Deno extension enabled.
    4. Extension reads `deno.importMap` setting and uses malicious `import_map.json`.
    5. During module resolution, import specifiers are redirected to attacker-controlled locations.
    6. Deno executes malicious code from redirected modules.

- Impact:
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE).

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. Extension relies on Deno CLI's import map functionality without specific security measures.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation for `import_map.json` content.
    - User warnings when import map is configured, especially external or untrusted.
    - Sandboxing to limit impact of redirected code.
    - Trust mechanism for import maps.

- Preconditions:
    - User has Deno for VS Code extension installed and enabled.
    - User opens attacker's workspace with malicious `import_map.json`.
    - `deno.enable` is true for workspace.
    - `deno.importMap` is active (implicitly by `import_map.json` or explicitly set).

- Source Code Analysis:
    - Code does not explicitly handle or validate `import_map.json` content.
    - `deno.importMap` setting passed to Deno Language Server as configuration.
    - Vulnerability in Deno Language Server's module resolution logic trusting `import_map.json` without security checks.
    - `client\src\extension.ts` initializes language client with `deno.importMap` from settings.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Files:**
        - Create `malicious.js` with malicious code (e.g., `console.log` and `fs.writeFileSync`).
        - Create `import_map.json` redirecting `std/fs/mod.ts` to `./malicious.js`.
        - Create `test.ts` importing `std/fs/mod.ts`.
    2. **Create VS Code Workspace:**
        - Open VS Code, open folder with malicious files as workspace.
    3. **Set `deno.importMap` Setting:**
        - Ensure `"deno.importMap": "./import_map.json"` is set in workspace settings or `import_map.json` is in workspace root.
    4. **Trigger Dependency Resolution:**
        - Open `test.ts`.
    5. **Verify Exploitation:**
        - Check "Deno Language Server" output panel for "Malicious code executed..." message.
        - Check workspace for `pwned.txt` file.
