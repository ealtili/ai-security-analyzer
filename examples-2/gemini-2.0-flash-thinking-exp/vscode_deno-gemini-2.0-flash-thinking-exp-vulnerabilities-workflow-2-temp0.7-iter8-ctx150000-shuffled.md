## Combined Vulnerability List

### 1. Malicious Import Map Arbitrary Code Execution
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious `importMap` file that redirects module imports to attacker-controlled code.
    2. The attacker tricks a user into configuring the "deno.importMap" setting in the VS Code Deno extension to point to this malicious `importMap` file. This can be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by compromising a project's workspace settings.
    3. The user opens a Deno project in VS Code with the Deno extension enabled.
    4. When the Deno Language Server initializes for the project, it reads the "deno.importMap" setting and uses the specified malicious `importMap` file for module resolution.
    5. When the user opens or interacts with Deno files in the project, the Deno Language Server attempts to resolve module imports based on the malicious `importMap`.
    6. Due to the redirection in the `importMap`, import statements like `import * as module from "some_module"` will now load code from the attacker's malicious module instead of the intended module.
    7. When the Deno Language Server processes these imports (e.g., during type checking, code completion, or other language features), the attacker's code from the malicious module gets loaded and executed within the VS Code environment.
    8. This allows the attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution within the user's VS Code environment.
- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.
    - Potential for data theft, installation of malware, or further system compromise.
    - Full control over the user's VS Code environment, allowing actions like modifying files, exfiltrating secrets, or controlling the editor's behavior.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The extension currently lacks specific mitigations for this vulnerability. It relies on the user to configure settings responsibly and to trust the source of the `importMap` file.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation: The extension should validate the `deno.importMap` setting to ensure it points to a valid and safe file path. This could include checks to prevent specifying remote URLs or paths outside the workspace. However, even local paths can be malicious if the attacker can influence the user's file system.
    - User warning: Display a prominent warning message to the user when an `importMap` setting is configured, especially if it points to a file outside the current workspace or to a remote URL. This warning should highlight the security risks of using untrusted `importMap` files.
    - Sandboxing/Isolation: While more complex, consider sandboxing or isolating the Deno Language Server process to limit the potential damage from arbitrary code execution. This would be a more robust mitigation but might have performance and compatibility implications.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user has the VS Code Deno extension installed and enabled.
    - The attacker can trick the user into setting a malicious file path in the "deno.importMap" setting in VS Code. This could be through social engineering, phishing, or by compromising a project's configuration files.
    - The user opens a Deno project in VS Code after configuring the malicious `importMap` setting.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The vulnerability does not stem from a specific flaw in the extension's code but rather from the inherent risk of allowing user-specified paths for `importMap` without proper validation or security considerations.
    - In `client/src/extension.ts`, the `initializationOptions` function reads the `deno.importMap` setting from the VS Code workspace configuration:
      ```typescript
      initializationOptions: () => {
        const denoConfiguration = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get(
          EXTENSION_NS,
        ) as Record<string, unknown>;
        commands.transformDenoConfiguration(extensionContext, denoConfiguration);
        return {
          ...denoConfiguration,
          javascript: vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get("javascript"),
          typescript: vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get("typescript"),
          enableBuiltinCommands: true,
        } as object;
      },
      ```
    - This `denoConfiguration` object, including the `importMap` setting, is then passed as initialization options to the Deno Language Server when the client is created:
      ```typescript
      const client = new LanguageClient(
        LANGUAGE_CLIENT_ID,
        LANGUAGE_CLIENT_NAME,
        serverOptions,
        {
          outputChannel: extensionContext.outputChannel,
          middleware: { ... },
          ...extensionContext.clientOptions, // includes initializationOptions
        },
      );
      ```
    - The extension code itself does not perform any validation or sanitization of the `deno.importMap` path. It directly passes the user-provided path to the Deno Language Server.
    - The Deno Language Server (part of the Deno CLI) then trusts and uses this `importMap` for module resolution, leading to the potential for malicious code injection if a malicious `importMap` is provided.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Malicious Files:**
        - Create a file named `malicious_import_map.json` with the following content:
          ```json
          {
            "imports": {
              "insecure_module": "file:///tmp/malicious_code.js"
            }
          }
          ```
          (Note: Adjust `/tmp/malicious_code.js` to a writable path on your system if `/tmp` is not suitable).
        - Create a file named `malicious_code.js` at `/tmp/malicious_code.js` (or the path you used above) with the following content:
          ```javascript
          // malicious_code.js
          console.log("Malicious code executed from import_map!");
          // Simulate malicious activity - for testing, a simple exit is sufficient.
          if (typeof process !== 'undefined') { // Check if 'process' is available (Node.js API in Deno)
              process.exit(1); // Terminate VS Code process as an example.
          } else {
              // Fallback if 'process' is not available (unlikely in this context but for robustness)
              throw new Error("Malicious code execution proof");
          }
          ```
          Ensure `malicious_code.js` is placed at the path specified in `malicious_import_map.json`.
    2. **Configure VS Code Deno Extension:**
        - Open VS Code.
        - Open Settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Code > Settings > Settings on macOS).
        - Search for "deno.importMap".
        - In the "Deno â€º Config: Import Map" setting, enter the absolute path to the `malicious_import_map.json` file you created (e.g., `/path/to/malicious_import_map.json`).
    3. **Create a Deno Project:**
        - Create a new folder for a Deno project or open an existing one.
        - Create a new TypeScript file, e.g., `test_vuln.ts`, with the following content:
          ```typescript
          import * as insecure from "insecure_module";

          console.log("After potentially malicious import.");
          ```
    4. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Open the `test_vuln.ts` file in the VS Code editor.
    5. **Observe the Impact:**
        - **Expected Outcome:**
            - You should see "Malicious code executed from import_map!" printed in the output or console of VS Code, indicating that the code from `malicious_code.js` was executed.
            - If `process.exit(1)` in `malicious_code.js` is executed successfully, VS Code might unexpectedly terminate or reload, demonstrating a significant impact.
        - **Verification:**
            - If you do not see the "Malicious code executed from import_map!" message and VS Code does not terminate, the test case might not be set up correctly, or the vulnerability may not be triggered as expected in your environment. Double-check the file paths and configurations.
    6. **Cleanup (Important):**
        - After testing, **immediately remove** the malicious `deno.importMap` setting from your VS Code settings to prevent unintended consequences in your development environment.
        - Delete the `malicious_import_map.json` and `malicious_code.js` files if they are no longer needed.

### 2. Path Traversal via `deno.config` setting
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can modify the `deno.config` setting in the workspace or user settings of Visual Studio Code.
    2. The attacker sets the `deno.config` path to a file outside the intended workspace directory by using relative path traversal sequences like `../../../`.
    3. When the VS Code Deno extension initializes or reloads the configuration, it reads the `deno.config` file from the attacker-specified path.
    4. If the Deno CLI or language server processes this configuration file without proper validation, it could lead to actions being performed in the context of the attacker-specified file path, potentially outside the intended workspace. For instance, the Deno language server might attempt to resolve modules or perform other file system operations based on the manipulated configuration, leading to arbitrary file system access.
- **Impact:**
    - **High:** Arbitrary file read. Depending on how the Deno CLI and language server process the configuration, it might be possible to achieve code execution if the attacker can craft a malicious configuration file that, when processed, leads to code execution within the context of the extension or the Deno CLI. At minimum, sensitive information from files outside the workspace could be exposed if the attacker can point the configuration to such files.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None identified in the provided project files. The extension reads the `deno.config` and `deno.importMap` settings and passes them to the Deno CLI/language server. There is no explicit sanitization or validation of these paths within the extension's client-side code to prevent path traversal.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Path Validation: The extension should validate the `deno.config` path to ensure it remains within the workspace directory or a designated safe location. Absolute paths could be restricted or carefully validated. Relative paths should be resolved against the workspace root and checked to prevent traversal outside the workspace.
    - Workspace Scope Enforcement: The extension should enforce workspace boundaries when resolving and accessing files specified in `deno.config` and related settings.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must have the ability to modify VS Code workspace or user settings. In a typical scenario, this would be a user opening a workspace provided by an attacker, or a user unknowingly modifying their own settings based on attacker instructions (social engineering).
    - The Deno extension must be enabled in the workspace.
    - The user must have Deno CLI installed and configured for the extension to use.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`README.md` and `docs/workspaceFolders.md`**: These files document the `deno.config` setting, indicating its purpose and how it's used to specify a configuration file for Deno. They mention that the path can be relative to the workspace or absolute.

    2. **`client/src/extension.ts`**: This is the main extension file. It initializes and manages the Language Client.
        - In `clientOptions.initializationOptions`, the extension reads the `denoConfiguration` from `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)`. This configuration likely includes `deno.config` and `deno.importMap`.
        - This configuration is passed as `initializationOptions` to the Language Client.
        - The Language Client then communicates with the Deno Language Server, sending these configuration options.


    5. **Absence of Path Validation:**  A review of the provided code files does not reveal any explicit path validation or sanitization logic applied to the `deno.config` or `deno.importMap` settings before they are passed to the Deno Language Server. The extension appears to trust the paths provided in the settings.


- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Pre-requisites:**
        - Install VS Code and the Deno VS Code extension.
        - Have Deno CLI installed and available in your system's PATH.
        - Create a workspace in VS Code.
        - Create a sensitive file outside your workspace, for example, in your user's home directory named `sensitive_data.txt` with some secret content. Let's say the workspace is in `/path/to/workspace` and the sensitive file is in `/home/user/sensitive_data.txt`.

    2. **Modify Workspace Settings:**
        - Open the workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`).
        - Add or modify the `deno.config` setting to point to the sensitive file using a path traversal sequence. For example:
          ```json
          {
              "deno.enable": true,
              "deno.config": "../../../home/user/sensitive_data.txt"
          }
          ```
          (Adjust the relative path based on your workspace location and the sensitive file location).

    3. **Reload VS Code Window:** Reload the VS Code window to ensure the settings are applied and the Deno extension re-initializes.

    4. **Trigger Extension Activity:** Open a TypeScript or JavaScript file within your workspace to activate the Deno language server. This could be any file that would typically engage the Deno extension's features.


### 3. Path Traversal via `deno.importMap` setting
- **Description:**
    - This vulnerability is analogous to the `deno.config` path traversal vulnerability.
    - An attacker can manipulate the `deno.importMap` setting to point to a file outside the workspace using path traversal sequences.
    - When the extension processes this setting, the Deno CLI/language server might attempt to load and use the import map from the attacker-controlled path.
    - This could lead to arbitrary file access when resolving modules based on the manipulated import map, and potentially code execution if the attacker can craft a malicious import map.
- **Impact:**
    - **High:** Similar to `deno.config` path traversal, impact includes arbitrary file read and potential for code execution depending on the processing of import maps by Deno CLI/language server.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None identified in the provided files.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Path Validation: Similar to `deno.config`, the `deno.importMap` path requires validation to ensure it stays within the workspace or a safe designated location. Workspace scope enforcement is needed during file resolution.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Same as `deno.config` path traversal vulnerability: Attacker can modify VS Code settings, Deno extension enabled, Deno CLI installed.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Source code analysis is similar to the `deno.config` vulnerability. The extension reads and passes the `deno.importMap` setting to the Deno Language Server without explicit validation in the client-side code.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Pre-requisites:** Same as `deno.config` test case.
    2. **Modify Workspace Settings:**
        - Open workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`).
        - Add or modify the `deno.importMap` setting to point to the sensitive file using path traversal:
          ```json
          {
              "deno.enable": true,
              "deno.importMap": "../../../home/user/sensitive_data.txt"
          }
          ```
          (Adjust path as needed).
    3. **Reload VS Code Window.**
    4. **Trigger Extension Activity:** Open a Deno/TypeScript file to engage the language server.


### 4. Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious `deno.path` Configuration
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker uses social engineering to trick a victim into installing the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension.
    2. The attacker persuades the victim to modify the `deno.path` setting within VS Code.
    3. Instead of specifying the correct path to the legitimate Deno CLI executable, the victim is misled into setting `deno.path` to point to a malicious executable controlled by the attacker.
    4. When the VS Code Deno extension attempts to invoke the Deno CLI for various features such as type checking, linting, formatting, testing, or upgrading Deno, it uses the path specified in `deno.path`.
    5. Consequently, the extension executes the attacker's malicious executable instead of the genuine Deno CLI.
    6. The malicious executable runs with the same privileges as the VS Code user, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's system.
- **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows the attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. This can have severe consequences, including:
    - Data theft and exfiltration of sensitive information.
    - Installation of malware, ransomware, or other malicious software.
    - Complete compromise of the victim's system, allowing the attacker to control the machine remotely.
    - Unauthorized access to and modification of files and system settings.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None in the code to prevent this specific social engineering attack.
    - The extension's README.md provides a note under "Usage" and "Configuration" sections mentioning the `deno.path` setting and the requirement to have Deno CLI installed. However, this serves as documentation, not an active mitigation against malicious path configuration.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input Validation for `deno.path`: Implement validation checks for the `deno.path` setting. This could include:
        - Verifying if the path points to an executable file.
        - Checking if the executable is indeed the Deno CLI by verifying its version or signature. (This is complex and might interfere with legitimate use cases, like using custom Deno builds).
        - Restricting the `deno.path` setting to known safe locations or prompting for confirmation if the path is outside standard directories.
    - Warning on `deno.path` Modification: Display a prominent warning message whenever a user modifies the `deno.path` setting. This warning should clearly articulate the security risks associated with pointing `deno.path` to untrusted or unknown executables and advise users to only set it to the path of a legitimate and trusted Deno CLI.
    - Enhanced Documentation: Improve the documentation to more prominently highlight the security implications of the `deno.path` setting. Add a dedicated security considerations section in the README.md that details this vulnerability and provides clear guidance to users on how to avoid it, emphasizing the importance of only using trusted Deno CLI executables.
- **Preconditions:**
    1. The victim has Visual Studio Code installed.
    2. The "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension is installed and enabled in VS Code.
    3. The attacker successfully social engineers the victim into altering the `deno.path` setting in VS Code to point to a malicious executable.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`client\src\util.ts`:**
        - `getDenoCommandPath()` function: This function is responsible for determining the path to the Deno executable. It first checks the `deno.path` configuration setting (`getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`). If a path is specified there, it is used directly without any validation.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Malicious Executable:**
        - Create a file named `malicious_deno` (or `malicious_deno.exe` on Windows) with malicious content.
    2. **Social Engineering (Simulated):**
        - Assume the attacker has convinced the victim to set `deno.path` to the malicious executable.
    3. **Configure `deno.path` in VS Code:**
        - Open VS Code.
        - Go to Settings (Ctrl+, or Code > Settings > Settings).
        - Search for "deno path".
        - Edit the "Deno â€º Path" setting and enter the path to the malicious executable.
    4. **Trigger Deno Extension Feature:**
        - Open any JavaScript or TypeScript file in VS Code.
        - Enable Deno for the workspace if not already enabled (using "Deno: Enable" command).
        - Attempt to format the document (Right-click in the editor > Format Document > Deno).
    5. **Observe Malicious Execution:**
        - Observe the output to confirm execution of malicious code.


### 5. Malicious Workspace Arbitrary Code Execution via `deno.path`
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker creates a malicious workspace folder.
    2. Inside the workspace folder, the attacker creates a `.vscode` directory.
    3. Within the `.vscode` directory, the attacker creates a `settings.json` file.
    4. In the `settings.json` file, the attacker sets the `deno.path` setting to point to a malicious executable located within the workspace or accessible to the victim's machine.
    5. The attacker convinces a victim to download and open this malicious workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension installed.
    6. When the workspace is opened, the Deno extension reads the `deno.path` setting from the `settings.json` file.
    7. Subsequently, when the extension attempts to execute a Deno command (e.g., for language server, linting, formatting, testing, or tasks), it uses the attacker-specified malicious path instead of the legitimate Deno CLI.
    8. The malicious executable is then executed with the privileges of the victim user, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact:**
    - Critical. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the victim's privileges. This can lead to complete compromise of the victim's local system, including data theft, malware installation, and further propagation of attacks.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None in the code. The README.md mentions the `deno.path` setting and that it can be used to explicitly set the path, but it does not warn against setting it to untrusted locations or provide any input validation.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input Validation and Sanitization: The extension should validate and sanitize the `deno.path` setting to ensure it points to a legitimate Deno executable and not to arbitrary or potentially malicious files, especially within the workspace.
    - Warning to User: When the extension detects that `deno.path` is configured within workspace settings, it should display a prominent warning to the user, indicating the security risk of allowing workspace settings to override the Deno executable path. The warning should advise users to only open workspaces from trusted sources.
    - Path Resolution Restrictions: The extension could restrict `deno.path` to only allow absolute paths or paths within specific trusted directories, preventing relative paths within the workspace that could be easily manipulated by an attacker.
    - User Confirmation: Before using a `deno.path` defined in workspace settings for the first time (or when it changes), the extension could prompt the user for explicit confirmation, emphasizing the security implications.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The victim must have the VSCode Deno extension installed.
    - The attacker must be able to convince the victim to open a malicious workspace folder in VSCode.
    - The victim must not be aware of the security risks associated with opening workspaces from untrusted sources and allowing workspace settings to be applied.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`client\src\util.ts` - `getDenoCommandPath()` function:**
        ```typescript
        export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
          const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath(); // [1]
          const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
          if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
            return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand(); // [2]
          } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) { // [3]
            // if sent a relative path, iterate over workspace folders to try and resolve.
            for (const workspace of workspaceFolders) {
              const commandPath = path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command); // [4]
              if (await fileExists(commandPath)) {
                return commandPath; // [5]
              }
            }
            return undefined;
          } else {
            return command; // [6]
          }
        }
        ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        a. Create a new directory named `malicious-workspace`.
        b. Inside `malicious-workspace`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
        c. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with malicious `deno.path` config.
        d. Inside `.vscode`, create a malicious script `malicious_deno.sh`.
    2. **Victim Action:**
        a. Open Visual Studio Code.
        b. Open the `malicious-workspace` folder.
        c. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for the workspace.
        d. Trigger a Deno command (e.g., debug `main.ts`).
    3. **Verification:**
        a. Check if `malicious_output.txt` has been created in the `malicious-workspace` directory, confirming execution of malicious script.


### 6. Command Injection in Deno Task Execution
- **Description:**
    - An attacker can craft a malicious `tasks.json` file within a Deno project.
    - This malicious `tasks.json` file can contain a Deno task definition with a command that includes injected system commands.
    - When a user opens this malicious Deno project in VS Code and executes the malicious task (either via the tasks sidebar or by selecting and running a task definition in a `tasks.json` file), the injected commands will be executed by the system.
- **Impact:**
    - **High**
    - Arbitrary command execution within the user's VS Code environment, running with the privileges of the VS Code process.
    - This could allow an attacker to read sensitive files, modify project files, install malware, or perform other malicious actions on the user's system.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The extension directly executes commands defined in `tasks.json` without sanitization.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input Sanitization: The extension should sanitize or validate the `command` and `args` properties of task definitions in `tasks.json` to prevent command injection.
    - Sandboxing/Isolation: Ideally, task execution should be sandboxed or isolated to limit the potential impact of command injection vulnerabilities. However, for VS Code extensions, full sandboxing might be challenging.
    - User Confirmation: Before executing tasks, especially those defined in workspace files like `tasks.json`, the extension could prompt the user for confirmation, especially if the command looks suspicious or contains potentially dangerous characters.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension installed.
    - The user must open a malicious Deno project in VS Code that contains a crafted `tasks.json` file.
    - The user must execute the malicious task, either via the tasks sidebar or by selecting and running a task definition in a `tasks.json` file.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts` - `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider.#runSelectedTask`:**
        ```typescript
        async #runSelectedTask() {
            // ...
                    await tasks.executeTask(buildDenoConfigTask(
                        workspaceFolder,
                        await getDenoCommandName(),
                        task.name,
                        task.command, // Task.command is taken directly from tasks.json
                        sourceUri,
                    ));
            // ...
        }
        ```
    - **`client\src\util.ts` - `readTaskDefinitions`:**
        ```typescript
        export function readTaskDefinitions(
          document: TextDocument,
          content = document.getText(),
        ) {
          // ...
              command = taskValue.value; // Command is directly taken from JSON string value
          // ...
            tasks.push({
              // ...
              command, // Unsanitized command is stored in task definition
              // ...
            });
          // ...
        }
        ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a new Deno project directory.
    2. Inside the project directory, create a `.vscode` folder.
    3. Inside the `.vscode` folder, create a `tasks.json` file with malicious command injection in `args`.
    4. Open the project directory in VS Code.
    5. Open the `tasks.json` file in the editor.
    6. Place the cursor within the "Malicious Task" definition in `tasks.json`.
    7. Run the command "Deno: Run Selected Task" from the command palette.
    8. Observe calculator application launched (or equivalent malicious command), demonstrating arbitrary command execution.


### 7. Command Injection in Test Code Lens via Test Name
- **Description:**
    - Step 1: An attacker crafts a malicious Javascript or Typescript file within a workspace.
    - Step 2: In this file, the attacker defines a Deno test function (`Deno.test()`) where the test name is maliciously crafted to include shell command injection payloads.
    - Step 3: The attacker shares this malicious workspace with a victim.
    - Step 4: The victim opens this malicious workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension enabled.
    - Step 5: The Deno extension detects the test and displays a "Run Test" code lens above the malicious test definition.
    - Step 6: The victim clicks the "â–¶ Run Test" code lens.
    - Step 7: The extension executes a `deno test` command that includes the maliciously crafted test name in a regular expression filter. Due to insufficient sanitization, the shell command injection payload embedded in the test name is executed.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process simply by tricking them into opening a malicious workspace and clicking "Run Test".
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The code attempts to sanitize the test name using a regular expression (`name.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, "\\$&")`) in `client\src\commands.ts` within the `test()` function to escape special characters before incorporating it into the `deno test --filter` command.
    - However, this sanitization is insufficient to prevent command injection as it does not escape shell metacharacters that can be used to break out of the intended command structure.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Proper sanitization of the test name to prevent command injection. Instead of just escaping regex special characters, the test name should be treated as a literal string and shell escaping should be applied to ensure it's not interpreted as shell commands. Ideally, avoid using shell `test --filter` argument with user provided input directly. Consider alternative methods for filtering tests if needed, or ensure complete sanitization for shell safety.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The victim must have the VS Code Deno extension installed and enabled.
    - The victim must open a malicious workspace containing a Javascript or Typescript file with a specially crafted Deno test definition.
    - The victim must click the "â–¶ Run Test" code lens associated with the malicious test.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `client\src\commands.ts`, function `test()`:
    ```typescript
    export function test(
      _context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
      extensionContext: DenoExtensionContext,
    ): Callback {
      return async (uriStr: string, name: string, options: TestCommandOptions) => {
        // ...
        const nameRegex = `/^${name.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, "\\$&")}$/`; // Insufficient sanitization
        const args = ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", nameRegex, filePath];
        // ...
        await vscode.tasks.executeTask(task); // Task is executed
        // ...
      };
    }
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    - Step 1: Create a new directory named `malicious-deno-workspace`.
    - Step 2: Inside `malicious-deno-workspace`, create a file named `malicious_test.ts` with a malicious test name.
    - Step 3: Open VS Code and open the `malicious-deno-workspace` folder.
    - Step 4: Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace.
    - Step 5: In `malicious_test.ts`, locate the "â–¶ Run Test" code lens above the `Deno.test` definition and click it.
    - Step 6: After the test execution completes, check for creation of `malicious_file_test_code_lens`, indicating command injection.


### 8. Command Injection in Tasks via tasks.json Configuration
- **Description:**
    - Step 1: An attacker crafts a malicious workspace with a `.vscode` folder and a `tasks.json` file.
    - Step 2: In `tasks.json`, the attacker defines a Deno task where the `command` or `args` fields are maliciously crafted to include shell command injection payloads.
    - Step 3: The attacker shares this malicious workspace with a victim.
    - Step 4: The victim opens this malicious workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension enabled.
    - Step 5: The Deno extension parses the `tasks.json` file and registers the malicious task.
    - Step 6: The victim executes the "Malicious Task" from the VS Code task menu (e.g., by running "Tasks: Run Task" and selecting "deno: Malicious Task").
    - Step 7: The extension executes the Deno task with the injected shell command.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the victim's machine by crafting a malicious `tasks.json` file and tricking the user into running the defined task.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - There are no explicit mitigations in place to sanitize the task `command` or `args` from `tasks.json` against command injection vulnerabilities within the provided code. The extension directly uses the values from the `tasks.json` to construct and execute shell commands.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization for task definitions from `tasks.json`. The extension should validate and sanitize the `command` and `args` fields in `tasks.json` to prevent command injection.  Consider using a safer API for executing commands that avoids shell interpretation or properly escaping all user-provided arguments before passing them to the shell.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The victim must have the VS Code Deno extension installed and enabled.
    - The victim must open a malicious workspace containing a `.vscode/tasks.json` file with a specially crafted Deno task definition.
    - The victim must execute the malicious task, either from the task menu or by other means.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `client\src\tasks.ts`, function `buildDenoTask()`:
    ```typescript
    export function buildDenoTask(
      target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
      process: string,
      definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
      name: string,
      args: string[], // args from task definition
      problemMatchers: string[],
    ): vscode.Task {
      const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
        process,
        args, // args are directly passed to ProcessExecution
        definition,
      );
      return new vscode.Task(definition, target, name, TASK_SOURCE, exec, problemMatchers);
    }
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    - Step 1: Create a new directory named `malicious-deno-workspace-tasks`.
    - Step 2: Inside `malicious-deno-workspace-tasks`, create a folder named `.vscode`.
    - Step 3: Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `tasks.json` with the malicious task definition from the description above with command injection in `args`.
    - Step 4: Inside `malicious-deno-workspace-tasks`, create an empty file named `index.ts`.
    - Step 5: Open VS Code and open the `malicious-deno-workspace-tasks` folder.
    - Step 6: Run the malicious task "deno: Malicious Task" from the task menu.
    - Step 7: Check for creation of `malicious_file_tasks_json` file, indicating command injection.
