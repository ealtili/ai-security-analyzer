## Vulnerabilities Report

The following vulnerabilities have been identified in the application.

### 1. Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsafe template rendering

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into user-provided data.
    2. If this user-provided data is rendered in Django templates within Unicorn components without proper escaping.
    3. The malicious JavaScript code will be executed in the victim's browser when the component is rendered, either initially or during updates.
- **Impact:**
    - Account Compromise: Attackers can steal user session cookies or credentials, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - Data Theft: Attackers can steal sensitive information displayed on the page or accessible to the user.
    - Malicious Actions: Attackers can perform actions on behalf of the user, such as making unauthorized transactions or modifying data.
    - Website Defacement: Attackers can alter the visual appearance of the website.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - CSRF protection is implemented.
    - HTML encoding is mentioned in documentation since v0.36.0 as a general mitigation for XSS.
    - `sanitize_html` function in `django_unicorn\utils.py` escapes HTML characters for component initialization data within `<script>` tags.
    - Django's template engine's auto-escaping is assumed to be the primary mitigation for template rendering.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Robust output escaping of all user-provided data rendered in Django templates within Unicorn components, beyond Django's default auto-escaping.
    - Input sanitization to proactively cleanse user-provided data of potentially malicious scripts before rendering.
    - Comprehensive security testing, including penetration testing and automated security scans, specifically targeting XSS vulnerabilities in Unicorn components.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Django templates are used to render Unicorn components.
    - User input, potentially from `unicorn:model` bindings or arguments passed to component actions, is incorporated into the component's data and rendered in the template.
    - Output escaping mechanisms are either not consistently applied or insufficient to neutralize all forms of malicious JavaScript injection in Unicorn components.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Django templates are used for rendering Unicorn components, and `unicorn:model` facilitates data binding.
    - Component data is rendered in templates using Django template syntax (e.g., `{{ name }}`).
    - `sanitize_html` function in `django_unicorn\utils.py` uses `html.escape` and is applied to component initialization data in `<script>` tags within `django_unicorn\components\unicorn_template_response.py`.
    - Consistent output escaping for user-provided data rendered directly within component templates relies on Django's default auto-escaping.
    - Potential XSS exists if user-provided data bound to component properties is rendered directly in templates without explicit and consistent escaping beyond Django's default auto-escaping. Further investigation is needed to confirm the effectiveness of output escaping in various rendering contexts, especially with `unicorn:model` and action arguments.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Set up a Django project with django-unicorn installed.
    2. Create a Unicorn component with a property `user_input_text`.
    3. In the component's template, render `user_input_text` using `<div>{{ user_input_text }}</div>`.
    4. Add an input field bound to `user_input_text` using `<input type="text" unicorn:model="user_input_text">`.
    5. Deploy the Django application to a test environment.
    6. Access the page with the component in a browser.
    7. Inject `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability')</script>` into the input field.
    8. Observe if a JavaScript alert box appears, confirming the vulnerability. Examine HTML source for unescaped `<script>` tag.
    9. Test with various XSS payloads to assess vulnerability comprehensively.

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to unsafe HTML rendering through `safe` usage

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through user input fields in a Django Unicorn component.
    2. If a developer uses `Meta.safe` or the `safe` template filter on user-controlled data without sanitization, the default HTML encoding is bypassed.
    3. The injected JavaScript code will be rendered directly in the user's browser.
    4. This occurs when displaying user-provided content marked as safe without proper sanitization.
    5. When a victim views the page, the injected JavaScript executes, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Impact:**
    - Account hijacking: Stealing session cookies or credentials.
    - Data theft: Accessing sensitive information visible to the user.
    - Website defacement: Modifying the content of the web page.
    - Redirection to malicious sites: Redirecting the user to phishing or malware sites.
    - Actions on behalf of the user: Performing actions as the logged-in user without their consent.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Django Unicorn by default HTML-encodes all component data rendered in templates using `_desoupify` method in `django_unicorn\components\unicorn_template_response.py` with `BeautifulSoup` and `HTMLFormatter` with `entity_substitution=EntitySubstitution.substitute_html`.
    - Documentation mentions `safe` attribute in `Meta` class and `safe` template filter to bypass default encoding.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Automatic sanitization of HTML content even when marked as safe using `Meta.safe` or `safe` filter.
    - Clearer and more prominent documentation emphasizing the risks of using `safe` and best practices for sanitization.
    - Static analysis tools or linters to detect potential unsafe usage of `safe`.
- **Preconditions:**
    1. Django Unicorn application renders user-controlled data.
    2. Developer used `Meta.safe` in component's view or `safe` template filter on user-controlled data.
    3. User-controlled data is not properly sanitized before being rendered as safe.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`django_unicorn\components\unicorn_template_response.py`**: `UnicornTemplateResponse._desoupify` method uses `BeautifulSoup` with HTML encoding by default.
    - **`tests\components\test_unicorn_template_response.py`**: `test_desoupify` confirms HTML encoding.
    - `Meta.safe` attribute and `safe` template filter bypass default encoding. Misuse of these features can introduce XSS.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a Django Unicorn component `xss_test` with a `user_input` property.
    2. Mark `user_input` as safe using `class Meta: safe = ("user_input",)`.
    3. Create component template `xss_test.html` to render `{{ user_input }}`.
    4. Include input field and button to update `user_input` property.
    5. Create Django view and template `test_xss.html` to include `xss_test` component.
    6. Configure URL to access `test_xss` view.
    7. Access `test-xss/` URL in a browser.
    8. Enter `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS Vulnerability')>` in the input field and click "Set Input".
    9. Observe an alert box "XSS Vulnerability", confirming the vulnerability due to misuse of `Meta.safe`.
