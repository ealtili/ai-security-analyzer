# Vulnerabilities in vscode_deno Extension

I've reviewed the input vulnerability against the criteria you've specified. While the described "Malicious Registry Import Auto-Completions" vulnerability has a detailed analysis, it's explicitly rated as "Medium" severity in the description.

According to your instructions, I should only include vulnerabilities that are high or critical severity. Since this vulnerability doesn't meet that threshold, and there are no other vulnerabilities in the input that match your criteria, I'm returning an empty list.

The described vulnerability requires multiple deliberate user actions (explicitly trusting a malicious registry and running code with permissions), which explains its medium severity rating. Deno's default security model also provides significant mitigation against the worst potential impacts.
