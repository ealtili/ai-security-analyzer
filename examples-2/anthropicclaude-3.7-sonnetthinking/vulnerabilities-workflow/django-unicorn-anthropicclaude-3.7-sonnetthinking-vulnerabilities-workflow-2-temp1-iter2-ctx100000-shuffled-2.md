# Vulnerabilities in Django Unicorn

After reviewing the provided vulnerabilities according to the specified criteria, I need to return an empty list.

The vulnerabilities described (XSS via `safe` Meta Attribute, XSS via Django Template `safe` Filter, and JSON Injection in Component Data Attributes) don't meet the inclusion criteria because:

1. None of them are ranked as "high" or "critical" severity (they are ranked as "medium" or "low")
2. Some rely on developers explicitly bypassing security features (using the `safe` attribute)
3. Some describe edge cases that are difficult to exploit in real-world scenarios

These vulnerabilities represent important security considerations for Django Unicorn developers, but they don't meet the specific severity threshold required for inclusion in this list.
