## Updated Vulnerability List

### 1. Exposure of Sensitive API Keys in Frontend Settings Dialog

- **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive Information Exposure via Environment Variables to Frontend

- **Description:**
  The screenshots-to-code project includes functionality to enter API keys directly in a frontend settings dialog (mentioned explicitly in the `README.md` under "Getting Started"). Users can input their API keys via browser UI fields, and the keys are stored client-side in the browser without server-side storage.
  Although the README states API keys are "never stored on our servers," allowing API key input and storage in frontend without strict management can lead to unintended exposure. To exploit this:
  1. An attacker accesses the publicly hosted instance (e.g., https://screenshottocode.com).
  2. Gains client-side execution—through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), malicious browser extensions, malware infections, or compromised client machines.
  3. Retrieves API keys directly from local browser storage or intercepted network/browser requests.

- **Impact:**
  API keys, especially those associated with high-value third-party APIs like OpenAI or Anthropic, can be misused by attackers. Potential abuse includes:
  - Unauthorized access to privileged resources via third-party APIs.
  - Financial harm by exhausting quotas or accruing unintended costs.
  - Further attacks, abuse, impersonation, or fraudulent activities conducted under the victim’s API key privileges.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - Statements clearly indicate keys are not stored in backend or on servers introduced by the project.
  - Limited exposure if server-side compromise occurs. Server breaches are less impactful given that keys remain client-side.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Secure frontend encryption mechanisms for client-side storage (such as encryption leveraging WebCrypto APIs, combined with user-specific secrets/password-derived keys).
  - Implementation guidance or enforced policies recommending users to manage sensitive API keys securely via managed backend environment configurations and secure credential store services.
  - Server-side authentication delegation, where keys are only handled and secured within backend and communicated via authenticated secured sessions, thus avoiding client-side sensitive credential storage entirely.

- **Preconditions:**
  - Victim must enter and preserve sensitive API keys in frontend UI.
  - Attacker requires client-side execution context (e.g., successfully injecting malicious JavaScript via Cross-Site Scripting).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  The vulnerability arises from client-side storage of sensitive keys based on explicit instructions documented in README without adequate protection:
  1. Frontend handling explicitly allows sensitive key entry through browser (as documented explicitly in the README):
     ```markdown
     Your key is only stored in your browser. Never stored on our servers.
     ```
  2. Client-side JavaScript code manages sensitive input and saves directly into accessible browser storage (Local Storage, Session Storage, IndexedDB, etc.).
  3. No segment of provided frontend files or backend configurations indicates implementation of encryption or secured management methodologies applied to sensitive user input.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. Access the publicly hosted instance of the application frontend.
  2. Navigate to and open the settings panel, inserting a mock or dummy API key (for example: dummy_secret_key).
  3. Use browser developer tools to inspect client-side storage (e.g., LocalStorage, IndexedDB).
     - Validation passes if the inserted dummy secret key is directly stored in plaintext and unencrypted.
  4. Execute a simulated malicious script injection through developer tools console:
     ```javascript
     console.log(localStorage);
     ```
     - Validation passes if the inserted dummy API key remains fully accessible, readable, and in plaintext without any encryption or additional protections.
