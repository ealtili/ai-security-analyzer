# Vulnerability List:

## Vulnerability 2: Insufficient Validation of Video/Screenshot Processing Inputs Leading to Potential Injection and SSRF

**Description:**
The backend accepts URLs and directly invokes `screenshotone.com` API without significant validation or restrictions upon provided URLs. This could potentially allow SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) attacks by submitting malicious internal URLs (e.g., `localhost` or internal resources) to this API. Moreover, user-supplied URLs are never strictly validated nor restricted to prevent attacker-controlled URLs from being processed.

**Impact:**
- Unauthorized internal resources or administrative interfaces may become accessible.
- The service used (`screenshotone.com`) may fulfill the request against internal or restricted resources, leaking sensitive data externally.
- Potential exploitation of internal services due to SSRF attack vector.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- Basic implementation of the screenshot API client (`backend/routes/screenshot.py`) has no URL validation or filtering implemented.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- No validation or filtering of user-supplied URLs to restrict internal IP ranges or reserved addresses.
- No URL sanitization policy enforcement to restrict access to internal endpoints or sensitive resources.

**Preconditions:**
- An attacker must have access to the public-facing API endpoint allowing URL submission for screenshot processing.

**Source Code Analysis:**
In file `backend/routes/screenshot.py`:
```python
async def capture_screenshot(target_url: str, api_key: str, device: str = "desktop") -> bytes:
    api_base_url = "https://api.screenshotone.com/take"

    params = {
        "access_key": api_key,
        "url": target_url,  # Unvalidated URL; attacker-controlled input
        ...
    }
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=60) as client:
        response = await client.get(api_base_url, params=params)
```

**Detailed analysis explanation:**
- User-submitted URLs (`target_url`) are directly embedded into HTTP GET parameters when invoking `https://api.screenshotone.com`.
- Because the URL is not validated or sanitized, an attacker may freely provide URLs pointing to internal or sensitive network locations (`localhost`, internal IP ranges, etc.).
- The request made through the external screenshot service (`screenshotone.com`) might access internal infrastructure or resources otherwise inaccessible from external networks, potentially leaking protected information.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Utilize the publicly accessible screenshot-taking service API endpoint.
2. Submit URLs pointing towards internal services such as:
   - `http://localhost:<internal-port>`
   - `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data`
   - Internal private IP addresses (e.g., `http://10.x.x.x` or `http://192.168.x.x`)
3. Validate responses from `screenshotone.com` API bring back screenshots or contents of internal resources otherwise unreachable directly from external networks.
4. Verify if unauthorized internal resource exposure occurs.

**Note:**
Vulnerability 1 ("Unrestricted Image URL Generation Leading to Potential Injection Attacks") is ranked medium severity and its described vectors, such as arbitrary JavaScript injection via image prompts from external AI services, currently lack concrete evidence or detailed source code paths demonstrating direct exploitability. Although theoretically plausible, this vulnerability's real-world exploitation scenario is unlikely given existing systemsâ€”no real source code evidence or successful exploit example provided. According to stringent provided instructions, medium-ranked vulnerabilities without concrete exploit evidence or detailed analysis demonstrating clear and realistic risk must be excluded. Hence, Vulnerability 1 is not included in the final validated list.

## Final Valid Vulnerabilities:
