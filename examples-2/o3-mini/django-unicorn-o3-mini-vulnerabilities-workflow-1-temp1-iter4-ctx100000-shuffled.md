## 1. Insecure Deserialization in Component Caching Mechanism

### Vulnerability Name
**Insecure Deserialization in Component Caching Mechanism**

### Description
The framework caches a component’s internal state by serializing select attributes (or the entire component object) using Python’s built‑in pickle module. This occurs in methods such as those in `django_unicorn/cacher.py` or `django_unicorn/components/unicorn_view.py`—depending on the version—where attributes are stored (via `pickle.dumps`) and later restored (via `pickle.loads`). An attacker who can manipulate the caching backend (for example, a misconfigured or publicly accessible Redis or Memcached server) may inject a malicious pickle payload. When the application later deserializes the tampered cache value, the malicious payload is executed, resulting in remote code execution (RCE).

*Step-by-step trigger:*
1. **Preparation:** Ensure that component caching is enabled (for instance, via an internal configuration flag such as `UNICORN["SERIAL"]["ENABLED"] = True`) and that a remote caching backend is used.
2. **Cache Manipulation:** Identify the cache key (often prefixed with `"unicorn:component:"` and followed by a component identifier) and, using an external connection, overwrite its stored value with a malicious pickle payload.
3. **Execution:** Cause the application to load the component (for example, by sending a legitimate AJAX update request) so that the cached payload is deserialized. The deserialization process will execute the attacker‑supplied payload.

### Impact
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker who controls the cache can run arbitrary Python commands on the server.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to data exfiltration or complete system takeover.
- **Access to Sensitive Data:** Unauthorized modifications may expose internal state and data.

### Vulnerability Rank
**Critical**

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- The caching mechanism leverages Django’s built‑in caching framework and, in many development environments, uses an in‑memory cache that is not available over the network.
- Documentation and default configurations assume that production cache backends (e.g. Redis/Memcached) are deployed in isolated, secured environments.

### Missing Mitigations
- **No Payload Integrity Verification:** There is no signing, HMAC validation, or integrity checking on the pickled data before deserialization.
- **Use of Unsafe Serialization:** The system does not offer an alternative, such as JSON‑based serialization, for caching public state.
- **Lack of Isolation Measures:** No additional firewall or network safeguards exist in the application’s code to prevent external write access to the caching backend.

### Preconditions
- **Cache Exposure:** The cache backend is misconfigured (or intentionally exposed) to allow external modification.
- **Caching Feature Enabled:** Component state caching is active in environments where the attacker can access the cache.
- **Attack Access:** The attacker is external and can connect directly to the caching system.

### Source Code Analysis
1. **Serialization:** In files such as `django_unicorn/cacher.py` or `django_unicorn/components/unicorn_view.py`, the component’s resettable state is stored using:
   ```python
   self._resettable_attributes_cache[attribute_name] = pickle.dumps(attribute_value)
   ```
2. **Deserialization:** Later, when a component is rehydrated (for example, in a `reset()` method or via `restore_from_cache()`), the cached bytes are processed as:
   ```python
   attribute_value = pickle.loads(pickled_value)
   ```
3. **Lack of Validation:** There is no additional check (such as verifying a signature or computing an HMAC) to ensure the integrity or authenticity of the payload before deserialization.
4. **Visualization:**
   ```
         [Cache Backend]
               │
      (stores pickled data)
               │

       Component Reload
               │
    [pickle.loads() called]   →  Executes malicious payload
   ```

### Security Test Case
1. **Setup:**
   - Deploy the Django application with a cache backend (e.g. Redis) that is externally accessible.
   - Enable component caching (ensure settings like `UNICORN["SERIAL"]["ENABLED"] = True` are active).
2. **Injection:**
   - Identify a cache key (e.g. `unicorn:component:<component_id>`) used by the system.
   - Overwrite its value with a crafted malicious pickle payload (designed in a controlled test to perform a benign action such as writing a marker file or logging a distinct message).
3. **Trigger:**
   - Initiate an AJAX update or action that causes the application to call the routine restoring the cached data.
4. **Observation:**
   - Verify (via logs, file system changes, or test indicators) that the malicious payload’s action has occurred.
5. **Expected Result:**
   - The test confirms that insecure deserialization allowed the payload execution, demonstrating the vulnerability.

## 2. Insecure Dynamic Module Import via Component Name Parameter

### Vulnerability Name
**Insecure Dynamic Module Import via Component Name Parameter**

### Description
In this vulnerability, the framework constructs module and class names dynamically by using the `component_name` parameter received via the URL (typically at an endpoint such as `/message/<component_name>`). Although the parameter is forced to match a regex pattern (allowing alphanumeric characters, underscores, dashes, dots, and slashes), an attacker can still supply a crafted component name. If the configuration (e.g. the list in `UNICORN["APPS"]`) is overly permissive, the dynamic importer may locate and load an unintended module or internal component. This scenario can enable the instantiation of components that expose sensitive or dangerous functionality.

*Step-by-step trigger:*
1. **Parameter Manipulation:** Supply a crafted `component_name` via the URL (or POST data), such as a fully‑qualified internal module name (e.g., `"internal.secret_module"`).
2. **Dynamic Import:** The framework’s dynamic import mechanism constructs candidate module paths by combining the input with settings from `UNICORN["APPS"]`, and then attempts to import the resulting module.
3. **Exploitation:** If an internal module is inadvertently imported and instantiated, its sensitive functionality may become externally accessible or even lead to arbitrary code execution if that module contains dangerous operations.

### Impact
- **Exposure of Sensitive Functions:** Loading unintended modules can reveal internal logic, secure operations, or administrative functionalities.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** If loaded modules provide capabilities to run system commands or alter configurations, they can be exploited further.
- **Data Leakage:** Internal component details or debug information may be compromised.

### Vulnerability Rank
**High**

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- The URL parameter is constrained by a regex pattern (`[\w/\.-]+`).
- The framework uses a developer‑controlled list (`UNICORN["APPS"]`) to narrow down candidate locations for component modules.

### Missing Mitigations
- **Lack of Whitelisting:** There is no explicit whitelist to ensure that only approved component names can be imported.
- **Insufficient Sanitization:** Beyond the regex match, there is no further verification to ensure that the final resolved module is strictly within the intended set.
- **Overly Permissive Settings:** The configuration via `UNICORN["APPS"]` may inadvertently allow broader module access than intended.

### Preconditions
- **Attack Control of Parameter:** The attacker can supply an arbitrary value to the `component_name` parameter (via the publicly available `/message/` endpoint).
- **Configuration Weakness:** The app’s configuration (specifically `UNICORN["APPS"]`) inadvertently allows access to modules that were meant to be internal only.

### Source Code Analysis
1. **Module Name Formation:** In `django_unicorn/components/unicorn_view.py`, the function (often named `get_locations(component_name: str)`) transforms the input parameter into candidate module paths.
2. **Iteration over Locations:** The framework iterates over entries in `UNICORN["APPS"]` and builds a candidate module location using the given component name.
3. **Dynamic Import:** The module is then imported dynamically without further confirmation that it exists within an allowed list.
4. **Visualization:**
   ```

               │
               ▼

     (Possibly loads unintended module)
   ```

### Security Test Case
1. **Setup:**
   - In a staging environment, configure `UNICORN["APPS"]` to a less restrictive or default value.
2. **Injection:**
   - Craft a POST request (or use a browser/postman) to `/message/<component_name>`, setting `<component_name>` to a deliberately suspicious name (e.g., `"internal.secret_module"`).
3. **Trigger & Observation:**
   - Submit the request and review the system’s response or error messages. Detailed error messages or unexpected behavior confirming the module’s identity would signal a vulnerability.
4. **Expected Result:**
   - The application either instantiates an unintended module or returns error details that reveal the internal module structure, confirming the insecure dynamic import vulnerability.

## 3. Detailed Error Message Disclosure in AJAX Responses

### Vulnerability Name
**Detailed Error Message Disclosure in AJAX Responses**

### Description
The application’s error handling mechanism (typically in `django_unicorn/views/__init__.py`) catches exceptions such as `UnicornViewError` and `AssertionError` and responds to AJAX requests by echoing back the full error string (via `str(e)`) in the JSON response. This detailed output can inadvertently expose internal information such as module paths, class names, and stack traces. An attacker can deliberately trigger errors by sending malformed requests and then analyze the returned error messages to gain insight into the application’s internal structure.

*Step-by-step trigger:*
1. **Error Triggering:** Send an AJAX POST request (for instance, to `/message/<component_name>`) with deliberately malformed or incomplete data designed to cause an exception.
2. **Error Capture:** Observe that the JSON response includes a fully detailed error message (e.g., internal stack trace, file paths).
3. **Information Gathering:** The attacker can use this information to map internal components and identify further attack vectors.

### Impact
- **Information Disclosure:** Detailed errors can reveal sensitive details about the internal workings of the application.
- **Facilitation of Further Attacks:** With excessive information, an attacker may craft more precise subsequent attacks (for example, targeting the dynamic module import or insecure deserialization).
- **Exposure of Debug Information:** Internal paths, file names, and even configuration details may be inadvertently disclosed.

### Vulnerability Rank
**High**

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- None beyond the standard exception handling; errors are caught and returned to clients without sanitization.

### Missing Mitigations
- **Error Sanitization:** Server should log detailed errors internally while returning only generic error messages (e.g., “An error occurred; please try again later”) to end users.
- **Configuration-Based Debugging:** There is no conditional logic to suppress detailed error output when the application is publicly available.

### Preconditions
- **Public Endpoint Access:** The attacker must be able to send AJAX (POST) requests that trigger errors.
- **Lack of Error-Sanitizing Mechanism:** No filtering is applied to the error details before they are returned in the response.

### Source Code Analysis
1. **Error Wrapping:** In `django_unicorn/views/__init__.py`, an error-handling decorator wraps the view function.
2. **Exception Capture:** It specifically catches exceptions like:
   ```python
   except UnicornViewError as e:
       return JsonResponse({"error": str(e)})
   except AssertionError as e:
       return JsonResponse({"error": str(e)})
   ```
3. **Direct Disclosure:** The use of `str(e)` directly sends internal error details to the client without modification or sanitization.
4. **Visualization:**
   ```
       [Exception Occurs]
               │
               ▼
       [Error Handling Decorator]
               │
       ┌─────────────────────────────┐
       │ Returns JSON: {"error": ...}│ → (Includes full error details)
       └─────────────────────────────┘
   ```

### Security Test Case
1. **Setup:**
   - Prepare a Django instance with the affected view endpoint (`/message/<component_name>`) accessible externally.
2. **Trigger:**
   - Create a POST request with data intentionally malformed (e.g., missing required fields or invalid types) to force an exception.
3. **Observation:**
   - Capture the JSON response and examine the `"error"` field for detailed stack traces or internal module or file path information.
4. **Expected Result:**
   - The response should contain only a generic error message; if it instead reveals detailed internal debugging data, the vulnerability is confirmed.

## 4. Template Path Traversal in Public Template Rendering

### Vulnerability Name
**Template Path Traversal in Public Template Rendering**

### Description
The view function (implemented in `example/www/views.py`) constructs the template file path by directly interpolating a user‐provided `name` parameter into a string (for example, using `f"www/{name}.html"`). Because there is no proper sanitization or validation of the `name` parameter, an attacker can include directory traversal sequences (such as `"../"`) to manipulate the file path. This can cause the application to render a template outside the intended directory.

*Step-by-step trigger:*
1. **Parameter Manipulation:** Specify a `name` parameter with traversal characters (e.g., entering `"../secret"`).
2. **Path Construction:** The view then constructs the path as `"www/../secret.html"`.
3. **Template Load:** If the file exists, Django will attempt to render it, thereby exposing internal or sensitive template content.

### Impact
- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Internal templates or files not intended for public view could be rendered, leaking sensitive information.
- **Potential Configuration Disclosure:** Access to templates might reveal application logic, configuration details, or internal directory structures.
- **Aiding Other Attacks:** The attacker may use the information gleaned from the template to further exploit other vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerability Rank
**High**

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- A try/except block catches `TemplateDoesNotExist` and raises an HTTP 404 error if a template is not found.

### Missing Mitigations
- **Input Validation:** There is no check to ensure that the `name` parameter does not contain traversal characters (e.g., `"../"`).
- **Secure Path Construction:** The implementation does not use safe path join functions or Django’s secure template lookup utilities to normalize and validate the template path.

### Preconditions
- **Public Accessibility:** The endpoint mapping the view is publicly accessible.
- **User Control:** An attacker can supply arbitrary values for the `name` parameter via URL parameters or query strings.

### Source Code Analysis
1. **Path Construction:** In `example/www/views.py`, the template function is defined as:
   ```python
   def template(request, name):
       try:
           return render(request, f"www/{name}.html", context={"example": "test"})
       except TemplateDoesNotExist:
           raise Http404
   ```
2. **No Sanitization:** The code simply concatenates the user‑supplied `name` without any sanitization to strip or reject traversal sequences.
3. **Visualization:**
   ```
         [User-supplied name: "../secret"]
                   │
                   ▼
         Constructed Path: "www/../secret.html"
                   │
                   ▼
         render(request, "www/../secret.html")
   ```
4. **Outcome:** If `"../secret.html"` exists, it gets rendered even though it lies outside the intended template directory.

### Security Test Case
1. **Setup:**
   - Deploy the application where the `template` view is mapped to a public URL.
2. **Injection:**
   - Using a web browser or tool (like cURL), send a GET request with a crafted `name` parameter that includes directory traversal characters (e.g., `/template/../settings`).
3. **Trigger & Observation:**
   - Observe whether a template outside the intended directory is rendered or whether any sensitive internal information is disclosed.
4. **Expected Result:**
   - The application should either sanitize the input and render only allowed templates or strictly return a generic 404 error without leaking internal path details.

## 5. Hardcoded Secret Key and Debug Mode Enabled in Production

### Vulnerability Name
**Hardcoded Secret Key and Debug Mode Enabled in Production**

### Description
The application’s configuration file (e.g. `example/project/settings.py`) contains a hardcoded `SECRET_KEY` and has `DEBUG` set to `True`. If these settings are deployed to a publicly accessible production instance, an attacker can exploit them in two ways:
1. **Secret Key Exposure:** The hardcoded key—used for cryptographic signing (session cookies, CSRF tokens, etc.)—allows an attacker to forge tokens or cookies.
2. **Debug Mode Exposure:** With `DEBUG=True`, any error triggered in the application will display a detailed debug page containing stack traces, file paths, and potentially other sensitive configuration details.

*Step-by-step trigger:*
1. **Deployment Mistake:** Deploy the application with the default settings where the secret key is visible and debug mode is enabled.
2. **Triggering Errors:** Cause an exception (via malformed requests) to display a Django debug error page.
3. **Exploitation:** Use the visible secret key to forge cookies or tokens, or use the disclosed internal details to map further attack vectors.

### Impact
- **Token Forgery & Session Hijacking:** An attacker who knows the secret key may generate valid tokens to bypass authentication controls.
- **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** Debug error pages may reveal internal paths, database configurations, and other sensitive details.
- **Complete Compromise:** Combined, these issues may allow an attacker to fully compromise the production environment.

### Vulnerability Rank
**Critical**

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- The default settings restrict `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to `["localhost"]` which offers some protection when used in strictly controlled development settings.
- However, if these settings are not overridden in production, mitigation is ineffective.

### Missing Mitigations
- **Dynamic Configuration:** There is no mechanism to load `SECRET_KEY` and `DEBUG` from secure environment variables or external configuration management.
- **Production Overrides:** No safeguards ensure that `DEBUG` is automatically disabled in production environments.
- **Key Rotation:** The hardcoded secret key is static and should be rotated periodically, especially for production use.

### Preconditions
- **Production Misconfiguration:** The same settings file (with `SECRET_KEY` hardcoded and `DEBUG=True`) is deployed to a publicly accessible environment.
- **Error Disclosure:** External users are able to trigger errors (via malformed requests) and view detailed debug pages.

### Source Code Analysis
1. **Settings File Content:** In `example/project/settings.py`, you will find:
   ```python
   SECRET_KEY = "p6b$i%36e_xg%*ok+55@uc(h9)#g+2fj#p%7g#-@y8s6+10q#7"
   DEBUG = True
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["localhost"]
   ```
2. **Lack of Conditional Logic:** There is no logic in place to change these settings dynamically based on the environment.
3. **Debug Output:** With `DEBUG=True`, Django’s error handler renders full stack traces and configuration details upon encountering exceptions.
4. **Visualization:**
   ```
         [Production Deployment]
                   │
                   ▼
         [Secret Key Exposed in Settings]
                   │
                   ▼
         [Trigger an Exception → Detailed Debug Page]
   ```

### Security Test Case
1. **Setup:**
   - Deploy the application on a public server using the provided settings without any overrides.
2. **Trigger:**
   - Force an error by sending a malformed request (or navigating to a non-existent page) to trigger Django’s error page.
3. **Observation:**
   - Review the rendered error page to check if detailed information, including the secret key and file paths, is displayed.
4. **Forgery Attempt:**
   - Using the known secret key, attempt to forge a session cookie or tamper with a signed password reset token to validate the risk.
5. **Expected Result:**
   - The test should confirm that the debug information and secret key exposure allow token forgery and significant information leakage.

## 6. Mass Assignment Vulnerability in Component State Update

### Vulnerability Name
**Mass Assignment Vulnerability in Component State Update**

### Description
When a component’s state is updated via incoming JSON payloads (typically at the `/message/` endpoint), the framework processes the data using a function (such as `set_property_value` found in `django_unicorn/views/action_parsers/utils.py`) that splits the property name (which may include dot‑notation) and assigns values using Python’s built‑in `setattr()`. No whitelist or filtering is applied to confirm that only public, safe attributes are updated. As a result, an attacker can send crafted JSON data to update private or protected attributes (for instance, attributes prefixed with an underscore) that control internal behavior, thereby tampering with component logic or escalating privileges.

*Step-by-step trigger:*
1. **Craft Request:** The attacker creates a JSON payload that includes updates for both expected public attributes and for private attributes (e.g., `_secret` or `force_render`).
2. **Submit Payload:** Using a forged or valid session (with proper CSRF tokens), the attacker sends a POST request to the `/message/` endpoint.
3. **Attribute Update:** The component’s update routine uses `setattr()` to update the attributes without filtering, so the private attribute’s value becomes overwritten.
4. **Resulting Behavior:** The component may then exhibit unintended behavior, bypass internal validations, or even alter its operational logic.

### Impact
- **State Tampering:** Unintended modification of internal component state may lead to logic bypasses or unexpected behavior.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Overwriting critical attributes could enable privilege escalation or disruption of the component’s normal operation.
- **Exploitation of Business Logic:** The attacker might force the component to re-render excessively or disable important sanity checks.

### Vulnerability Rank
**High**

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- When rendering component state, only public attributes (determined via an internal `_is_public` check) are sent to the frontend.
- Standard Django CSRF protections are applied on the `/message/` endpoint to restrict request origins.

### Missing Mitigations
- **Lack of Request-side Filtering:** The routine that updates component state does not validate or restrict the property names, allowing reserved or private attributes to be modified.
- **No Whitelisting:** There is no server‑side whitelist or guard against updating attributes starting with an underscore or reserved names.

### Preconditions
- **Authenticated Submission:** The attacker must be able to send a POST request (using valid CSRF credentials or via CSRF exploitation) to the `/message/` endpoint.
- **Component Design:** The targeted component includes private or sensitive attributes that are not intended to be externally modifiable.

### Source Code Analysis
1. **JSON Parsing:** In `django_unicorn/views/action_parsers/utils.py`, the incoming JSON payload is parsed to obtain property names (which may include dot‑notation for nested attributes).
2. **Dynamic Assignment:** The function splits the property name and directly uses `setattr()` (or an internal helper like `_set_property`) to update the attribute:
   ```python
   setattr(component, property_name, new_value)
   ```
3. **No Protection:** There is no code that checks if the property being set is among a list of allowed attributes or if it is marked as internal (e.g., prefixed with an underscore).
4. **Visualization:**
   ```
         [JSON Payload with "private._secret": "value"]

                   ▼
          [set_property_value() process]

                   │
                   ▼
         [Component’s internal state altered]
   ```

### Security Test Case
1. **Setup:**
   - Deploy the application with a test component that defines a private attribute (for example, `_secret` initialized with a safe value).
   - Ensure the `/message/` endpoint is accessible and that a valid CSRF token can be obtained.
2. **Injection:**
   - Craft a JSON request payload that includes an update for the private attribute (e.g., `{"_secret": "malicious_value"}`) along with any required valid public attribute updates.
3. **Trigger:**
   - Submit the POST request to `/message/<component_name>`.
4. **Observation:**
   - Examine the updated component’s state through its rendered output or diagnostic endpoints to check if `_secret` has been altered.
5. **Expected Result:**
   - In a secure implementation, attempts to update private attributes should be rejected or ignored. If the private attribute is updated to “malicious_value”, the vulnerability is confirmed.

---

*This combined list includes all vulnerabilities with a rank of at least high that are valid and not already mitigated in a publicly accessible deployment scenario. It is strongly recommended to address these issues promptly to harden the application against external attacks.*
