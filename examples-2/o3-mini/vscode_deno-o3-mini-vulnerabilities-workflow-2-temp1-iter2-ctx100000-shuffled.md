# Combined Vulnerability List

## Vulnerability: Arbitrary Command Execution via Malicious Workspace Configuration

### Vulnerability Name
- **Malicious Workspace Configuration Override Leading to Arbitrary Code Execution via `deno.path`**
  *(Also referred to as "Arbitrary Command Execution via Malicious Workspace Configuration")*

### Description
An attacker can leverage a malicious workspace configuration to achieve arbitrary command execution. The attacker prepares (or tricks a user into creating) a workspace that includes a manipulated configuration file (e.g., a `.vscode/settings.json`) where the `"deno.path"` property is set to an absolute path pointing to an attacker‑controlled executable. When the victim opens this workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension enabled, the extension reads the unsanitized configuration value and uses it to launch the Deno language server or to execute Deno tasks.

**Step-by-Step Exploitation:**
1. **Crafting the Malicious Configuration:**
   - The attacker creates or modifies a workspace’s `.vscode/settings.json` file with the following content:
     ```json
     {
       "deno.path": "/absolute/path/to/attacker-controlled_executable"
     }
     ```
   - This file is then distributed (for instance, via a repository) or placed in a location where the victim is likely to open it.
2. **Triggering the Vulnerability:**
   - The victim clones or opens the affected workspace in Visual Studio Code.
   - With the Deno extension enabled, the extension calls the helper function `getDenoCommandPath()` (located in `client/src/util.ts`) to retrieve the `"deno.path"` value from the workspace configuration.
3. **Execution Flow:**
   - The unsanitized path is returned, and later, in the language server startup routine (e.g., inside `client/src/commands.ts` in the `startLanguageServer` function), this path is used directly to spawn a process.
   - As a result, the attacker-controlled executable is launched with the parameters passed by the extension (such as `"lsp"`) and with the same privileges as the VS Code process.

This chain of events results in the execution of arbitrary code on the victim’s machine.

### Impact
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Execution of an attacker‐controlled binary may lead to complete system compromise.
- **Full System Compromise:** The vulnerability could permit data exfiltration, lateral movement within a network, and execution of additional malicious activities, especially in enterprise environments.

### Vulnerability Rank
- **Critical**

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- The function `getDenoCommandPath()` verifies whether the provided executable exists on the file system (using checks such as `fs.stat` or helper functions like `fileExists()`).
- When no explicit configuration is provided, the extension falls back to resolving the command from the system’s PATH.

### Missing Mitigations
- **Input Validation / Whitelisting:**
  There is no verification that the configured `"deno.path"` points to a legitimate and trusted Deno executable. A whitelist of allowed directories or a signature/integrity check is missing.
- **User Confirmation:**
  No prompt or warning is issued when a nondefault or suspicious absolute path is detected.
- **Privilege Restriction / Sandboxing:**
  The process spawned by the extension is not sandboxed or executed under restricted privileges.

### Preconditions
- The workspace must include a malicious configuration file (e.g., `.vscode/settings.json`) where `"deno.path"` is set to an absolute path controlled by an attacker.
- The victim must open this workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension active.
- The malicious executable (or a shim executing controlled code) must reside at the indicated path on the victim’s system.

### Source Code Analysis
- **Retrieving the Configuration:**
  - In `client/src/util.ts`, the function `getDenoCommandPath()` calls `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` which retrieves the `"deno.path"` configuration value using VS Code’s workspace configuration API without any further sanitization.
  - If an absolute path is provided, the function returns the path as is after a basic existence check.
- **Using the Malicious Path:**
  - In `client/src/commands.ts`, inside the `startLanguageServer` routine, the returned command is directly assigned to the `command` property in the `serverOptions` used by the LanguageClient:
    ```ts
    const command = await getDenoCommandPath();
    const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
      run: { command, args: ["lsp"], options: { env } },
      debug: { command, args: ["lsp"], options: { env } },
    };
    ```
  - No additional verification or sanitization is performed on the command before its use.
- **Implication:**
  This chain of function calls and the absence of robust validation allows an attacker-controlled configuration file to force the execution of an arbitrary binary.

### Security Test Case
1. **Setup:**
   - Create a test workspace containing a `.vscode/settings.json` file with the content:
     ```json
     {
       "deno.path": "/absolute/path/to/malicious_simulator.sh"
     }
     ```
   - Implement a test executable or script `/absolute/path/to/malicious_simulator.sh` that, for example, writes to a specific log file, displays a benign alert, or creates a marker file. Ensure that it has the appropriate executable permissions.
2. **Execution:**
   - Open the test workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension installed.
   - Trigger the language server startup process (for instance, by running the “Deno: Enable” command) or execute an action that relies on the `"deno.path"` configuration.
3. **Verification:**
   - Check for evidence that the test executable was triggered (e.g., review the log file or verify the presence of the marker file created by the script).
   - Confirm that the Deno extension uses the path specified in the workspace configuration, thereby validating that an attacker-controlled setting can indeed result in arbitrary command execution.
4. **Environment:**
   - It is advised to perform these tests in a controlled environment (such as a virtual machine or container) to prevent unintended damage.
