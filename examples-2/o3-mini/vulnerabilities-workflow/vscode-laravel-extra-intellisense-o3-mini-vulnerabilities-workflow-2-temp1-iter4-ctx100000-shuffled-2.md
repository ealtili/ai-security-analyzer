#### Vulnerability Name: Unintended PHP Code Execution via Malicious Laravel File Injection

- **Description:**
  A malicious actor with the ability to modify files in a Laravel project (for example, via a compromised dependency or direct write access) can inject PHP code into files that are loaded during the autocompletion setup. When the extension queries the Laravel application (for example, to retrieve routes, configurations, views, models, etc.), it calls the helper function that bootstraps the Laravel project by including files such as the vendor autoloader and the bootstrap file. In doing so, the injected PHP code is executed.

  **Step by Step Trigger:**
  1. The attacker gains write access to the Laravel project (for example, by compromising a dependency, service provider, or configuration file).
  2. The attacker injects a malicious PHP payload into a file that is guaranteed to be loaded during bootstrap—such as a modified service provider or an altered bootstrap/app.php file.
  3. The developer opens the Laravel project in VS Code with the Laravel Extra Intellisense extension enabled.
  4. The extension periodically issues queries (via functions like `Helpers.runLaravel()`) to the Laravel application, which, in turn, loads the malicious file and executes the payload.
  5. The attacker’s payload runs under the context of the developer’s machine.

- **Impact:**
  The malicious PHP code can execute arbitrary operations on the developer’s system (for example, opening a reverse shell, modifying or exfiltrating files, or installing persistence mechanisms), leading to a total compromise of the machine and the project environment.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The extension’s README and security note warn developers that the extension automatically executes the Laravel application to fetch autocompletion data and advises disabling it when editing “sensitive” files (such as service providers).
  - The PHP command used for execution is configurable (via the setting `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand`), so a user can theoretically alter it.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - There is no sandboxing or isolation of the PHP code execution; the extension simply spawns a shell process with the project’s PHP bootstrap.
  - No integrity checks or cryptographic verifications of the Laravel core files or service providers are performed before execution.
  - There is a lack of runtime monitoring or restrictions that could detect or prevent an injected payload from executing harmful operations.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must have write access to (or be able to inject code into) the Laravel project files that the extension loads (e.g., service providers, bootstrap, or configuration files).
  - The extension must be active and configured with a “live” PHP command (using default or custom settings) on the developer’s machine.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `Helpers.runLaravel()` (see *helpers.ts*), the function first checks for the existence of `vendor/autoload.php` and `bootstrap/app.php`. It then assembles a PHP command string which includes these files along with additional PHP code that is meant to output JSON (e.g., autocompletion data).
  - The command string is built simply by concatenating strings—including the contents of the bootstrap file—without performing any integrity or sanitization checks on the included Laravel files.
  - Finally, the command is passed unprotected to Node’s `cp.exec()`, so any malicious PHP code present in a loaded file is automatically executed under the shell that the extension spawns.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Environment Setup:** Prepare a test Laravel project (with harmless content) and install the Laravel Extra Intellisense extension in a controlled VS Code environment.
  2. **Attack Simulation:** Edit a service provider or bootstrap file to include a benign “malicious” payload (for example, PHP code that writes a file named `vulnerable.txt` into the project folder or logs a distinct message).
  3. **Execution:** Trigger an autocompletion event (e.g., open a PHP/Blade file that calls a function the extension intercepts). This causes the extension to call `Helpers.runLaravel()` and execute the bootstrap process.
  4. **Verification:** Verify that the payload has executed—for example, check for the creation of `vulnerable.txt` or the appearance of the distinct log message.
  5. **Result:** Confirmation that the injection via modified Laravel files leads to unwanted code execution demonstrates the vulnerability.

#### Vulnerability Name: Insecure Command Injection through Unsanitized PHP Command Configuration

- **Description:**
  The extension uses a configurable command template (stored in the setting `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand`) to execute PHP code. The extension substitutes a placeholder `{code}` with dynamically generated PHP code (which is built from various introspection calls to the Laravel app) in its helper method `Helpers.runPhp()`. Because the substitution uses straightforward string replacement with only minimal escaping (e.g., replacing double quotes and, on Unix-like systems, dollar signs), an attacker who can influence either the dynamically generated code (via injected malicious PHP code in project files) or modify the configuration can inject unintended shell command fragments.

  **Step by Step Trigger:**
  1. The attacker modifies the Laravel project data (or a configuration file) such that the dynamically generated PHP code (passed as the `{code}` parameter) contains unexpected characters or payload fragments not fully neutralized by the minimal escaping routines.
  2. When the extension builds the command in `Helpers.runPhp()`, the injected content may break out of the intended PHP code context.
  3. The resulting command—executed via `cp.exec()` which uses the shell—may include unintended shell commands.

- **Impact:**
  This can lead to arbitrary shell commands executing on the developer’s machine, further increasing the risk of system compromise beyond the PHP environment.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The code in `Helpers.runPhp()` does apply basic escaping—for example, replacing double quotes and, on Unix-like systems, escaping the `$` character and certain quotes.
  - The PHP command template is fetched from the extension configuration, which under normal usage is trusted.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - There is no robust or context-aware sanitization of the dynamically generated PHP code before it is substituted into the command template.
  - The command is constructed using simple string replacement rather than using safer methods (such as non‑shell‑invoking process spawns or proper argument quoting) to prevent shell injection.
  - No validation is performed to ensure that the payload does not contain additional shell metacharacters that might lead to injection.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must be able to influence the dynamic PHP code (for example, by modifying Laravel project files) or modify the extension’s configuration (which is typically stored locally but may be altered by a malicious plugin or compromised environment).
  - The extension must be running and using a command template that relies on shell substitution (e.g., the default “php -r \"{code}\"”).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `Helpers.runPhp()` (see *helpers.ts*), the PHP code is first “sanitized” using simple regular‑expression replacements such as `code.replace(/\"/g, "\\\"")`.
  - On Unix-based platforms, further replacements are applied (such as escaping the `$` character) but these are rudimentary and may not cover all possible injection vectors.
  - The command template (for example, `php -r \"{code}\"`) is then modified by replacing `{code}` with the (minimally escaped) PHP code.
  - Finally, the constructed command is executed using Node’s `cp.exec()`, which runs the command in a shell. The use of a shell means that any additional shell metacharacters that survive the minimal escaping could trigger unintended command execution.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Environment Setup:** In a controlled testing environment, configure a test project and adjust the extension’s setting for `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` if needed to experiment with injection payloads.
  2. **Attack Simulation:** Craft a PHP code payload (or modify a file that contributes to the dynamically generated PHP code) that contains extra shell metacharacters—aiming to “break out” of the intended command string. For safety, the payload should do a harmless action like writing a unique marker file.
  3. **Execution:** Trigger an autocompletion action that forces the extension to call `Helpers.runPhp()` with the crafted payload.
  4. **Verification:** Monitor the output (or use a logging mechanism) to determine if extra shell commands are executed; for example, check if the unique marker file is created or if unexpected shell output appears.
  5. **Result:** Successful execution of shell command fragments beyond the intended PHP code indicates that the injection vector is exploitable.
