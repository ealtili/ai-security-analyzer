### Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Command Injection via Overridable phpCommand Configuration

**Description:**
The extension uses a configuration setting (`LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand`) as a command‐template for invoking PHP code. In the helper’s `runPhp` function, the placeholder `{code}` is simply replaced with the generated PHP snippet and then passed to Node’s `cp.exec()` without proper sanitization of the entire template. An attacker who supplies a malicious workspace (via a manipulated .vscode/settings.json) can override this setting with extra shell commands. For example, by setting the value to a string such as
```
php -r "{code}"; echo 'MALICIOUS_INJECTION';
```
the attacker can force the shell to execute the injected command.

**Impact:**
This vulnerability may result in remote code execution (RCE) on the victim’s machine—with the privileges of the VSCode process—allowing an attacker to run arbitrary system commands, exfiltrate data, or cause further system compromise.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The code performs simple escaping of double quotes in the generated PHP snippet and applies minor character replacements on Unix platforms.
- **However:** No true validation or sanitization is performed on the entire `phpCommand` configuration string.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Robust input validation and sanitization for the entire command template.
- Use of safer execution methods (for example, using child process arguments instead of shell-interpolated strings).

**Preconditions:**
- A malicious repository contains a .vscode/settings.json that overrides the `phpCommand` value with an injected payload.
- The victim opens this repository in VSCode so that the compromised settings are loaded.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `Helpers.runPhp` (lines excerpted below), the extension retrieves and uses the configuration value without proper filtering:
  ```js
  let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace
      .getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense")
      .get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
  let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);
  cp.exec(command, { cwd: ... });
  ```
  Since the replacement is a simple string substitution, an attacker can supply a template that executes additional commands.

**Security Test Case:**
- **Step 1:** In a test workspace, create a `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets:
  ```json
  {
    "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}\"; echo 'MALICIOUS_INJECTION';"
  }
  ```
- **Step 2:** Open the workspace in VSCode so the extension loads these settings.
- **Step 3:** Trigger any functionality that causes the extension to run PHP code (for example, an autocompletion request that calls `runPhp`).
- **Step 4:** Verify that the output (for example, in the extension’s output channel) contains the injected text “MALICIOUS_INJECTION”, confirming that the additional command was executed.

### Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary PHP Code Injection via Manipulated basePathForCode Configuration

**Description:**
The extension builds file paths for PHP code execution by concatenating the user-controlled setting `LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode` with fixed path segments (for example, appending `/vendor/autoload.php`). In the `Helpers.projectPath` function (when the `forCode` flag is true), the configuration value is used verbatim without sanitization. An attacker who supplies a malicious value (for example, ending the desired string literal and appending arbitrary PHP code) can inject and execute their own PHP commands.

**Impact:**
The unsanitized concatenation enables arbitrary PHP code injection. Once this payload is executed—via the extension’s routine calls to `Helpers.runLaravel`—the attacker can run custom PHP code in the context of the Laravel application, leading to complete compromise of the host system.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- No verifiable controls exist in this area. The code merely concatenates the configuration value with a hard-coded path.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Strict validation and sanitization of the `basePathForCode` setting to ensure it is a well-formed, expected filesystem path.
- Proper escaping of any user-supplied data incorporated into PHP source code.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker’s repository (or externally provided workspace) includes a `.vscode/settings.json` with a manipulated value for `LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode` (e.g.,
  `/var/www/html'; system('echo INJECTED'); //`).
- The victim opens the repository in VSCode, causing the extension to use the malicious configuration.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `Helpers.projectPath`, when `forCode` is true, the code executes:
  ```js
  let basePathForCode = vscode.workspace
      .getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense")
      .get<string>('basePathForCode');
  // No sanitization is performed here.
  return basePathForCode + path;
  ```
- The result is directly inserted into the PHP code constructed in `Helpers.runLaravel`:
  ```php
  require_once '" + Helpers.projectPath("vendor/autoload.php", true) + "';
  ```
  If `basePathForCode` contains a malicious payload, the require statement can be broken out of and exploited to execute arbitrary PHP.

**Security Test Case:**
- **Step 1:** In a test workspace, set a malicious `basePathForCode` in `.vscode/settings.json`, for example:
  ```json
  {
    "LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode": "/var/www/html'; system('echo INJECTED'); //"
  }
  ```
- **Step 2:** Open the workspace in VSCode so that the extension loads the malicious configuration.
- **Step 3:** Trigger any extension functionality that calls `Helpers.runLaravel` (such as fetching configuration or translation data).
- **Step 4:** Look for evidence (for example, in the output logs) that “INJECTED” is echoed, confirming that the PHP injection was successful.

### Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary PHP Code Injection via Manipulated modelsPaths Configuration

**Description:**
In the `EloquentProvider.loadModels` method, the extension dynamically builds a PHP snippet used to load Eloquent models. It does so by retrieving the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths` configuration (which defaults to `[ "app", "app/Models" ]`) and concatenating its values into a PHP array literal without proper escaping. An attacker can supply a malicious `modelsPaths` value (for example, by inserting a single quote and arbitrary PHP code) that breaks out of the intended string literal context and executes injected PHP code.

**Impact:**
This vulnerability can lead to remote code execution within the PHP context. Exploiting it would allow an attacker to run arbitrary PHP commands on the victim’s system, potentially compromising the Laravel application and the host system.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The extension assumes that configuration values are safe and does not perform sanitization on the values from `modelsPaths`.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Proper validation and sanitization of each entry in `modelsPaths` to ensure they contain only expected path characters.
- Escaping of any special characters (such as single quotes) that may break out of string literals when constructing PHP commands.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker supplies a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` that overrides `LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths` with an injected string—for example:
  ```json
  {
    "LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths": ["app', system('echo INJECTED'); //"]
  }
  ```
- The victim then opens this workspace in VSCode, triggering the vulnerable code path inside the extension.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `EloquentProvider.loadModels`, the PHP code is constructed as follows:
  ```js
  Helpers.runLaravel(
    "foreach (['" +
    vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<Array<string>>('modelsPaths', ['app', 'app/Models']).join("', '") +
    "'] as $modelPath) { ... }",
    "Eloquent Attributes and Relations"
  )
  ```
- Because the configuration values are concatenated directly into the PHP string using single quotes, an injected single quote from a malicious configuration value can break out of the intended literal and execute unintended PHP code.

**Security Test Case:**
- **Step 1:** In a controlled test environment, create a `.vscode/settings.json` that sets:
  ```json
  {
    "LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths": ["app', system('echo INJECTED'); //"]
  }
  ```
- **Step 2:** Open this workspace in VSCode so that the extension reads the manipulated `modelsPaths` configuration.
- **Step 3:** Trigger the functionality that causes `EloquentProvider.loadModels` to execute (for example, by waiting for the periodic refresh or manually causing model reload).
- **Step 4:** Check the extension’s output logs or any observable system output for the text “INJECTED”. If observed, it confirms that arbitrary PHP code was executed.

Each of these vulnerabilities arises from the use of unvalidated, workspace‐controlled configuration values in the dynamic construction of PHP commands. Mitigating these issues would require strict input validation, proper escaping of dynamic values, and avoidance of exposing direct command execution interfaces to unsanitized configuration content.
