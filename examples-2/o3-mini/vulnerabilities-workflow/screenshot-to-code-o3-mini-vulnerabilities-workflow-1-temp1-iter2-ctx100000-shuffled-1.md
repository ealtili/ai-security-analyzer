Below is the updated list of high‐risk/critical vulnerabilities that meet the criteria for inclusion. Each vulnerability is valid, not already mitigated in the project, and has a vulnerability rank of at least **High**. These vulnerabilities can be triggered by an external attacker on a publicly available instance of the application.

## 1. SSRF in Screenshot API Endpoint

**Description:**
The `/api/screenshot` endpoint (in `backend/routes/screenshot.py`) accepts a JSON request containing a user‑supplied URL. This URL is passed directly to an external screenshot service (https://api.screenshotone.com/take) without any validation or filtering. An attacker can supply an internal or otherwise malicious URL (for example, an internal IP such as `http://169.254.169.254/`) so that the backend makes an unintended outbound request.

**Impact:**
This Server‑Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability could allow an attacker to access internal resources, bypass network segmentation, or interact with non‑public services on the internal network. In a worst–case scenario, it might lead to further internal reconnaissance or other secondary attacks.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
No input validation or URL whitelisting is implemented on the screenshot endpoint.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Validate and sanitize the incoming URL.
- Use a whitelist of allowed hostnames or reject any URL that resolves to a private/internal IP range.
- Optionally proxy and validate responses from the external service so that the backend does not inadvertently expose internal data.

**Preconditions:**
- The `/api/screenshot` endpoint is publicly accessible.
- The server is allowed to make outbound network calls without filtering.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `backend/routes/screenshot.py`, the `ScreenshotRequest` model accepts fields for `url` and `apiKey`.
2. The function `capture_screenshot(target_url, api_key, device)` uses the provided `target_url` in constructing a GET request to the external screenshot API without any validation.
3. As a result, an attacker-controlled URL is directly forwarded to the external API, enabling an SSRF condition.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Send a POST request to `/api/screenshot` with a JSON body similar to:
   ```json
   {
     "url": "http://169.254.169.254/",
     "apiKey": "any-value"
   }
   ```
2. Monitor whether the server makes an outbound request to the specified internal IP (for example, by checking network logs or using a controlled server endpoint).
3. Verify that the response or behavior indicates the processing of an internal URL, confirming the SSRF vulnerability.

## 2. Arbitrary File Disclosure via Path Traversal in Eval Endpoints

**Description:**
The endpoints used to retrieve evaluation outputs (e.g. `/evals` and `/pairwise-evals` in `backend/routes/evals.py`) accept a folder path as a query parameter. The provided folder path is used directly (with no sanitization or restriction) to list directory contents and read files. An attacker can supply an absolute or relative path (for example, `/etc` or `../../secret`) to read arbitrary files from the server’s file system.

**Impact:**
Sensitive system files, internal documentation, configuration files, or other confidential artifacts may be disclosed. The resulting information disclosure could facilitate further attacks such as privilege escalation or lateral movement within the environment.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
No bounds checking or directory restrictions are applied—the folder path is used as provided.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Implement strict input validation on the folder parameter to ensure paths are restricted to a designated, safe directory.
- Use a whitelist of allowed directories or properly canonicalize and validate the provided path before it is used in file system operations like `os.listdir(…)`.

**Preconditions:**
- The eval endpoints are publicly accessible.
- An attacker can control the `folder` (and other similar) query parameters.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `backend/routes/evals.py`, the function `get_evals(folder: str)` directly accepts a folder path via the query string and converts it to a path object using `Path(folder)` without further sanitization.
2. The code then calls `os.listdir(folder)` and reads files ending in “.html” from that directory.
3. A similar unsanitized pattern is found in the pairwise eval endpoint, allowing an attacker to potentially access arbitrary directories.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Send a GET request to `/evals?folder=/etc` (or another directory known to contain sensitive files).
2. Observe whether the response includes a file listing or reveals error details that indicate directory traversal.
3. Additionally, test relative paths (e.g. `../../`) to verify if unauthorized file disclosure is possible.

## 3. Insecure Debug File Storage Exposing Sensitive Data

**Description:**
The debug system (in `backend/debug/DebugFileWriter.py`) writes detailed artifacts—such as prompt messages, AI completions, and full code responses—to a file system location determined by the environment variable `DEBUG_DIR` whenever debug mode is enabled (as controlled by `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED`). If debug mode is mistakenly enabled in a production environment or the debug directory is not properly secured, an attacker may access these files to obtain sensitive internal details.

**Impact:**
Exposure of detailed internal debug logs and artifacts can reveal architectural details, internal API key usage, AI prompt structures, and other sensitive data. Such exposure could be used to further compromise the system, conduct targeted attacks, or escalate privileges.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- Debug logging is controlled by the `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` environment variable.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Ensure that debug mode is disabled by default for production deployments.
- Store debug artifacts in a secured, non‑public directory with strict access control policies.
- Consider redacting sensitive information from debug outputs before writing them to disk.

**Preconditions:**
- The application is deployed in a production setting with `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED=True`.
- The debug directory (as specified by `DEBUG_DIR`) is accessible by unauthorized parties (for example, if misconfigured as a publicly served static asset directory).

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `backend/debug/DebugFileWriter.py`, when `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` is true, the application creates or uses a directory defined by `DEBUG_DIR` to store debug artifacts.
2. The code proceeds to write various debug files (such as full AI response data and extracted HTML) into this directory without applying any additional security controls.
3. This insufficient protection of debug data poses a risk if the directory is publicly accessible.

**Security Test Case:**
1. In a controlled test environment, deploy the application with `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED=True` and specify a known debug directory via `DEBUG_DIR`.
2. Trigger an AI–driven code generation or relevant action that writes debug artifacts to the directory.
3. Attempt to access or list the files in the debug directory through the public interface or other means to verify whether sensitive debug information is exposed.

Each of these vulnerabilities remains unmitigated in the current project source code and poses significant risks if exploited by an external attacker on a publicly available instance of the application.
