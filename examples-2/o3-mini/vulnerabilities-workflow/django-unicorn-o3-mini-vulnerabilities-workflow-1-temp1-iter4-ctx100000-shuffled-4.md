# Vulnerability List

## 1. Insecure Deserialization in Component Caching Mechanism

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Deserialization in Component Caching Mechanism
- **Description:**
  The library caches and later restores a component’s internal state by “pickling” the complete component object (using Python’s built‑in pickle module) in the class `CacheableComponent` (see file `django_unicorn/cacher.py`). When the component is restored via the function `restore_from_cache`, the cached bytes are unpickled without any additional integrity or authenticity checks. An attacker who can inject data into the caching backend (for example, by exploiting a misconfigured or publicly accessible Redis or Memcached instance) could place a malicious pickle payload. When this payload is deserialized, arbitrary code could be executed on the server—potentially leading to full remote code execution.

- **Impact:**
  If an attacker gains the ability to modify the cache entries (e.g. via a misconfigured cache backend), they could inject malicious pickle payloads that result in remote code execution. This may compromise the entire server environment and allow the attacker to access sensitive data, alter application behavior, or even control the host system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The caching mechanism is built on top of Django’s standard caching framework. In development the dummy cache (which does not actually cache data) is sometimes used.
  - The design assumes that the cache backend (e.g. Redis or Memcached) is deployed in a secured and isolated environment so that only trusted internal processes may read or write cache data.
  - The project documentation stresses that in production one should choose a properly configured cache backend that is not accessible externally.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - There is no additional data integrity or authenticity check applied to the cached payload before unpickling. The application relies solely on the security of the underlying cache configuration.
  - No alternative—safer—serialization mechanism (such as JSON-based serialization) is provided or used in place of pickle.
  - The library does not enforce strict isolation or cryptographic verification of the cached data even when caching is enabled.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The component caching feature is enabled (i.e. the `SERIAL.ENABLED` setting is set to `True` in the Unicorn settings).
  - The cache backend (configured via `CACHES` and referenced by the `CACHE_ALIAS` setting) is a remote or shared cache that an external attacker might be able to write to (for example, a Redis or Memcached instance that is misconfigured or lacking proper network isolation/authentication).
  - The attacker is able to inject arbitrary data into the caching system.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In the file `django_unicorn/cacher.py`, the `CacheableComponent.__enter__` method walks the entire component tree and, for each component, temporarily removes the (unpickleable) request object and then implicitly relies on Python’s pickle mechanism to verify that the component is pickleable.
  - Later, the function `cache_full_tree()` is used to save each component object into the chosen cache using its cache key.
  - When a request is made that uses cached components, the function `restore_from_cache()` retrieves the cached pickle payload and calls (implicitly) a pickle‑load on it. No integrity or authenticity validations are performed on the payload retrieved.
  - If an attacker can replace the value stored under a given cache key with a malicious pickle payload, the very next time `restore_from_cache()` is called the unpickling process will execute the attacker’s payload.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup:**
     - Configure the Django application to use a cache backend that is externally accessible (or simulate this in a test environment); for example, configure Redis without proper firewalls or authentication.
     - Enable component caching by setting `UNICORN["SERIAL"]["ENABLED"] = True` and ensure that the app uses this cache backend.
  2. **Injection:**
     - Craft a malicious pickle payload (in a secure, controlled test environment, for example using a small test payload that writes to a log file or creates a specific marker file on disk).
     - Use a cache‐injection tool or write a simple script that uses the same cache library to set a specific component cache key (for example, one matching a known component created during testing) to the malicious pickle payload.
  3. **Trigger:**
     - Send a legitimate component update request (for example, by invoking the “message” endpoint for the affected component) so that the application calls `restore_from_cache()` for that component’s cache key.
  4. **Observation:**
     - Verify that the malicious code executes (for example, confirmation that the marker file is created or a specific log entry appears).
  5. **Result:**
     - Confirm that the payload was executed as a result of the deserialization process, thereby demonstrating that an attacker controlling the cache backend can achieve arbitrary code execution.


## 2. Mass Assignment Vulnerability in Component State Update

- **Vulnerability Name:** Mass Assignment Vulnerability in Component State Update
- **Description:**
  The framework updates a component’s state based on JSON data received via the `/message/` endpoint. This update is performed by the function `set_property_value` (located in `django_unicorn/views/action_parsers/utils.py`), which takes an incoming property name—potentially including nested fields—and sets the corresponding attribute on the component instance using Python’s dynamic attribute assignment (via `setattr()` or by invoking `_set_property`). There is no whitelist or filtering mechanism to restrict modifications only to intended “public” attributes. Consequently, an attacker who can send a crafted JSON payload can update any attribute—including those meant to be internal or protected (for example, attributes such as `force_render` or others that control internal operation)—thereby manipulating component behavior.

- **Impact:**
  Unauthorized modification of a component’s internal state can result in unexpected behavior and logical bypasses. An attacker could force state changes (for example, causing a component to always re-render or bypass validation checks), potentially leading to data integrity issues or compromising subsequent business logic based on the component’s state.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The framework does distinguish between public and protected attributes when exposing component state for rendering (using the `_is_public` method), but this check is not enforced during the state update process.
  - Standard Django CSRF protections are applied on the `/message/` endpoint.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - There is no safeguard (such as a whitelist or exclusion list) in the property update routine to prevent the modification of sensitive or protected attributes.
  - The update function does not check for attribute names that start with an underscore or that match a set of internal property names before applying updates via `setattr()`.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must be able to send a POST request to the `/message/` endpoint. This scenario is particularly likely in applications where the endpoint is exposed and the attacker can either leverage a valid session or bypass CSRF protections.
  - The targeted component defines attributes that—although intended for internal use—are not otherwise shielded against external modification.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `django_unicorn/views/action_parsers/utils.py`, the `set_property_value` function accepts a property name (which may be nested, e.g. `"foo.bar"`), splits this string by periods, and traverses the component or sub-object hierarchy using `getattr()` without verifying whether the attribute is allowed to be updated.
  - When the final attribute segment is reached, the function updates the attribute by calling the component’s `_set_property` method (or by directly using `setattr()`), with no check that the attribute isn’t a protected or internal variable.
  - Because no filtering is imposed, a malicious payload could specify property names such as `"force_render"` (or any other critical attribute) and change its value to one that undermines the component’s intended behavior.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup:**
     - Deploy the Django application with a test component that defines a sensitive attribute (for example, `force_render` set to `False` by default).
     - Ensure that the `/message/` endpoint is active and that the CSRF protection is either in place or, in a controlled test environment, that a valid CSRF token is acquired.
  2. **Injection:**
     - Craft a JSON payload containing an action (e.g., of type `"callMethod"` or `"syncInput"`) with a data section that includes an update such as `"force_render": true`.
  3. **Trigger:**
     - Send a POST request to the `/message/{component_name}` endpoint with the crafted payload.
  4. **Observation:**
     - Examine the component’s subsequent behavior or internal state (for example, by triggering a re-render or by checking a diagnostic indicator) to determine whether the sensitive attribute has been updated.
  5. **Result:**
     - If the test confirms that the protected attribute was modified (e.g., the component now behaves as if `force_render` is set to `True`), this demonstrates a successful exploitation of the mass assignment vulnerability.
