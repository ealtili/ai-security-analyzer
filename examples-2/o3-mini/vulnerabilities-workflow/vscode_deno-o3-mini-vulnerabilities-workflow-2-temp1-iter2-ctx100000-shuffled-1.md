- **Vulnerability Name:** Malicious Workspace Configuration Override Leading to Arbitrary Code Execution via `deno.path`

- **Description:**
  - An attacker can prepare and distribute (or trick a user into creating) a workspace containing a malicious configuration file (for example, a workspace’s `.vscode/settings.json`).
  - In that file the attacker sets the `"deno.path"` property to point to an attacker‑controlled executable (e.g. an absolute path to a malicious binary).
  - When the user opens this workspace in VS Code with the Deno extension installed, the extension reads the configuration value using VS Code’s workspace configuration API.
  - The function `getDenoCommandPath()` (in `client/src/util.ts`) retrieves this value without further trusted validation or sanitization.
  - Later, in the language server startup routine (in `client/src/commands.ts` within `startLanguageServer`), the extension uses the returned value as the command to launch the Deno Language Server.
  - Because the provided path is taken at face value, the extension ends up spawning the attacker‑controlled binary (with any environment variables as passed) thereby achieving arbitrary code execution.

- **Impact:**
  - An attacker gains the ability to run arbitrary code on the victim’s machine.
  - This can lead to a full system compromise, data exfiltration, or further lateral attacks.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The function `getDenoCommandPath()` checks whether the provided command exists on the file system (using `fs.stat`) and distinguishes between absolute and relative paths.
  - If no explicit path is configured, the extension falls back to resolving the command from the system’s PATH.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - No validation is performed on the workspace-supplied value of `"deno.path"` to ensure that it points to a trusted or expected location.
  - There is no mechanism that rejects an absolute path provided by a workspace configuration, even though such a value can be manipulated by an attacker.
  - No integrity verification or code-signing checks exist to ensure that the executable being launched is the genuine Deno CLI.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The victim must open a workspace that has been maliciously configured (for example, via a distributed or specially crafted workspace with a `.vscode/settings.json` overriding `"deno.path"`).
  - The malicious workspace configuration must supply an absolute path to an attacker-controlled executable.
  - The victim’s VS Code instance uses the workspace configuration (i.e. the Deno extension does not enforce a trusted, global setting for `"deno.path"`).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `client/src/util.ts`, the function `getDenoCommandPath()` calls `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`, which retrieves the user‑configured value for `"deno.path"` from the workspace.
  - If the path is absolute, the code iterates over workspace folders and returns that value without further checks.
  - In `client/src/commands.ts` (inside the `startLanguageServer` function), the extension awaits `getDenoCommandPath()` and then uses the returned command in the `serverOptions` for the LanguageClient. No additional sanitization or verification is applied to the executable path.
  - This chain of functions means that an attacker who controls the workspace’s settings can force the extension to execute an arbitrary binary.

- **Security Test Case:**
  - **Step 1:** Create a test workspace containing a `.vscode/settings.json` file with the following content:
    ```json
    {
      "deno.path": "/path/to/attacker-controlled/malicious_executable"
    }
    ```
    *(For testing purposes, "/path/to/attacker-controlled/malicious_executable" should be replaced with a controlled binary that—for example—creates a file, logs a unique message, or performs some benign but observable action when executed.)*
  - **Step 2:** Open the workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension installed.
  - **Step 3:** Execute an action that causes the extension to start the Deno Language Server (for example, running the “Deno: Enable” command).
  - **Step 4:** Verify that the malicious executable was executed (e.g. by checking for the creation of the marker file or observing the benign output/log generated by the controlled binary).
  - **Step 5:** Confirm that this demonstrates the ability for an attacker’s configuration to override the default executable and cause arbitrary code execution.
