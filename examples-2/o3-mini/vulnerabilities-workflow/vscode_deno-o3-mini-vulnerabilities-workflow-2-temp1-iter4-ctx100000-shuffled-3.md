- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Deno Executable Path Resolution
  **Description:**
  The extension reads the value of the configuration setting `"deno.path"` from the workspace and, if provided, uses it as the command to run Deno. If a relative path is given, the code resolves it against every workspace folder until a file is found (via the simple existence check using `fs.stat()`). An attacker who controls the workspace configuration (for example, using a malicious `.vscode/settings.json`) can set `"deno.path"` to reference an arbitrary executable (e.g. `"./malicious_exe"` or even an absolute path to a compromised binary). When a user then invokes a Deno command (such as “Deno: Cache”, “Deno: Test” or “Deno: Run”), the extension calls `getDenoCommandPath()` (in `client/src/util.ts`) and ends up executing the attacker‑supplied executable without any further validation.
  **Impact:**
  An attacker‑controlled executable may run arbitrary code on the user’s system when the extension invokes Deno commands. This could lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or installing persistent backdoors—all running in the context of the VS Code extension (and sometimes with the user’s privileges).
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The code checks whether a file exists (using an asynchronous `fs.stat` call) before returning its path.
  - It distinguishes absolute from relative paths and attempts to resolve a relative path against all workspace folders.
    (However, no check is made to verify that the found file is the genuine Deno CLI executable.)
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - No verification is performed on the executable’s identity (for example, by checking its version, signature, or expected behavior).
  - The extension does not warn the user when a custom or nonstandard `"deno.path"` is in use.
  - There is no whitelisting or prompt that confirms the user intends to use a custom binary that is outside trusted locations.
  **Preconditions:**
  - An attacker must be able to supply or modify the workspace configuration such that `"deno.path"` is set to an attacker‑controlled path.
  - The user must open the malicious workspace and have the extension enabled so that the modified setting is used.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `client/src/util.ts`, the function `getDenoCommandPath()` first retrieves the `"deno.path"` configuration using `workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string>("path")`.
  - If a non‑absolute (i.e. relative) path is provided, it iterates over the workspace folders to resolve the path and tests for existence using a helper `fileExists` method that calls `fs.stat()`.
  - No further checks (e.g. executing `deno --version` and comparing the output) are made to validate that the file is a legitimate Deno executable.
  **Security Test Case:**
  - Create a VS Code workspace (or add a folder to a multi‑root workspace) and include a `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets:
    ```json
    {
      "deno.path": "./malicious_exe"
    }
    ```
  - In the workspace folder, add an executable file named `malicious_exe` (for testing, this might simply print a distinctive message or write to a log file).
  - Open the workspace in VS Code with the Deno extension enabled.
  - Trigger a command that invokes the Deno executable (for example, run “Deno: Cache” or “Deno: Test”).
  - Verify that the command spawns your test executable (e.g. by checking that the malicious message is logged or that the expected harmful action occurs) rather than a genuine Deno process.
  - Confirm that no warning or validation is presented before executing the attacker‑supplied executable.
