## 1. Insecure Configurable PHP Command Injection via phpCommand Setting

**Description:**
The extension obtains the command template from the configuration setting `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` and uses it directly to construct the shell command that executes PHP code (in the `Helpers.runPhp` function). A malicious repository (via a tailored `.vscode/settings.json`) can override this setting. For example, an attacker may supply the following payload:

```json
{
  "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}\"; rm -rf /"
}
```

When the extension calls `runPhp`, the placeholder `{code}` is replaced with generated PHP code, and the injected shell command (e.g. `rm -rf /`) is executed immediately.

**Impact:**
Arbitrary command execution occurs with the victim’s privileges. An attacker can run any shell command, resulting in potential data loss, privilege escalation, or system compromise.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The configuration value is simply read by the extension without any sanitization or strict validation.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Input validation or whitelisting for command templates.
- Use of safe API methods to build shell commands (e.g. avoiding direct string substitution into `cp.exec`).

**Preconditions:**
- The victim opens a repository that supplies a malicious `.vscode/settings.json`, which overrides `phpCommand`.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `Helpers.runPhp`, the extension reads the command template:

  ```javascript
  let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
  ```

- The extension then performs a simple string replacement:

  ```javascript
  let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);
  ```

- Finally, it passes the constructed command directly to `cp.exec` without escaping the substituted content. This direct substitution permits injection of additional shell commands.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Create a workspace with a `.vscode/settings.json` containing:

   ```json
   {
     "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}\"; echo 'Injected code executed';"
   }
   ```

2. Open the workspace in VSCode (with settings trust enabled) and force an action that triggers a call to `Helpers.runPhp` (for example, by refreshing the autocompletion data).
3. Verify that the output channel (or observe system side effects) shows the text “Injected code executed,” confirming that the malicious shell command was executed.

## 2. PHP Code Injection via Manipulated basePathForCode Setting

**Description:**
The extension uses the configuration `LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode` to determine the base path used in generated PHP code. This value is concatenated directly into PHP `require` statements in the command built by the `Helpers.runLaravel` function. If an attacker sets the `basePathForCode` value to a string containing a single quote and malicious PHP code, the generated code may break out of the intended literal and execute arbitrary commands. For example, if the `.vscode/settings.json` contains:

```json
{
  "LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode": "'; system('calc'); //"
}
```

then the following code line:

```php
require_once '" + Helpers.projectPath("vendor/autoload.php", true) + "';
```

may expand to something like:

```php
require_once ''; system('calc'); //vendor/autoload.php';
```

**Impact:**
Arbitrary PHP code execution in the context of the extension (and indirectly within the bootstrapped Laravel application). An attacker can run any PHP function, leading to further compromise of the victim’s system.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- No escaping or input validation is applied to the `basePathForCode` configuration value.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Proper sanitization and strict validation of all workspace‑supplied filesystem path values.
- Escaping any special characters before concatenation into PHP code.

**Preconditions:**
- The victim’s workspace configuration is overridden by a malicious repository supplying a crafted `basePathForCode` value.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `Helpers.projectPath`, when the parameter `forCode` is true, the function pulls the value from `basePathForCode` and resolves it without any sanitization.
- In `Helpers.runLaravel`, this unsanitized value is used in a `require` statement constructed as follows:

  ```php
  "require_once '" + Helpers.projectPath("vendor/autoload.php", true) + "';"
  ```

A maliciously crafted value disrupts the PHP string literal and injects arbitrary PHP code.

**Security Test Case:**
1. In a test repository, add a `.vscode/settings.json` with:

   ```json
   {
     "LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode": "'; system('calc'); //"
   }
   ```

2. Open the repository in VSCode and trigger an action that causes `Helpers.runLaravel` to run.
3. Observe whether the injected PHP command (for example, launching Calculator on Windows) is executed, confirming successful code injection.

## 3. PHP Code Injection via Unsanitized modelsPaths Configuration

**Description:**
The `EloquentProvider` uses the `modelsPaths` configuration value to locate model files by constructing a PHP array literal that is passed to PHP code via `Helpers.runLaravel`. The code concatenates the paths directly using:

```javascript
"foreach (['" + vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<Array<string>>('modelsPaths', ['app', 'app/Models']).join("', '") + "'] as $modelPath) { … }"
```

If an attacker provides a `modelsPaths` array containing a value with embedded quotes and additional PHP code (for example, `["app','; system('calc'); //"]`), the resulting PHP code will be malformed and execute the injected payload.

**Impact:**
Arbitrary PHP code execution during model loading. This could compromise both the application and the host system.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The configuration value is used directly from the user’s workspace settings without any sanitization.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Validate and strictly constrain acceptable `modelsPaths` values to known safe directory names.
- Properly escape special characters before embedding them in dynamically generated PHP code.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker supplies a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` that overrides the `modelsPaths` configuration with a crafted payload.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `EloquentProvider.loadModels()`, a PHP array literal is constructed using:

  ```javascript
  "['" + modelsPaths.join("', '") + "']"
  ```

Because no sanitization is performed, a value such as `"app','; system('calc'); //"` breaks out of the literal context, injecting arbitrary PHP code.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Create a `.vscode/settings.json` in a test workspace with:

   ```json
   {
     "LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths": ["app','; system('calc'); //"]
   }
   ```

2. Open the workspace in VSCode so that the `EloquentProvider` reloads the model information.
3. Verify that the injected PHP command is executed (for instance, by observing that Calculator launches), proving that arbitrary PHP code is executed.

## 4. PHP Code Injection via Malicious File/Directory Names in TranslationProvider

**Description:**
The `TranslationProvider` scans translation directories (e.g. the `lang` folder) and extracts translation group names from file and directory names. These names are then embedded (without proper escaping) into a PHP code snippet that is constructed as follows:

```javascript
"echo json_encode([" + translationGroups.map((transGroup: string) => "'" + transGroup + "' => __('" + transGroup + "')").join(",") + "]);"
```

If an attacker supplies a repository where a directory, file, or even a translation file name is crafted to contain characters such as single quotes and PHP code (for example, a directory named `test'); system('calc'); //`), the resulting PHP code will have injected commands that execute malicious code.

**Impact:**
Arbitrary PHP code execution is possible during the translation loading process, which leads to a remote code execution vulnerability on the victim’s machine.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- There is no sanitization or escaping of file and directory names before they are embedded into PHP code.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Properly escape and validate any file-derived strings before inserting them into dynamic PHP code.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker controls the repository’s language directory structure, including file and folder names, so that malicious payloads are inserted as translation group names.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `TranslationProvider.loadTranslations()`, translation group names are gathered directly from directory listings.
- These values are concatenated into a PHP code string without any escaping:

  ```javascript
  translationGroups.map((transGroup: string) => "'" + transGroup + "' => __('" + transGroup + "')")
  ```

A malicious translation group name can break out of the literal string context and inject arbitrary PHP code.

**Security Test Case:**
1. In a test repository, create a `lang` directory (or a namespaced translation folder) and include a file with a name such as:

   ```
   test'); system('calc'); //
   ```

   (Ensure the file extension matches the expected pattern for translation files.)

2. Open the repository in VSCode so that the `TranslationProvider` scans the translations.
3. Check whether the injected payload is executed (for example, by seeing that Calculator launches), thereby proving that PHP code injection occurred.

---

Each of the above vulnerabilities arises from the unsanitized usage of user‑controlled values (either via configuration files or file system data) when dynamically assembling PHP code. Mitigations such as strict input validation, output escaping, and the use of secure command execution practices are essential to prevent these types of attacks.
