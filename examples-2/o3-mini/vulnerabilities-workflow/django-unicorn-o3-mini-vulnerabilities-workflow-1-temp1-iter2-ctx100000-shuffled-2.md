Below is the updated list of vulnerabilities that meet the criteria—each is valid, not already fully mitigated, and has a vulnerability rank of at least high. Note that these issues are exploitable by an external attacker targeting a publicly available instance of the application.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insufficient Checksum Length Allowing Data Tampering
  **Description:**
  The framework’s request integrity mechanism is based on an HMAC–SHA256 checksum computed over component data. However, after computing the full digest, the framework converts it via ShortUUID and uses only the first eight characters. This dramatic truncation reduces the collision resistance of the checksum, enabling an attacker who intercepts or alters AJAX requests to iteratively adjust the payload and brute–force a matching truncated checksum.
  **Impact:**
  An attacker who successfully forges a payload with the same weak (8–character) checksum can bypass the integrity check. This may allow data tampering or unintended execution of component actions, potentially corrupting the state or escalating further attacks within the application.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The checksum is generated using HMAC with Django’s secret key.
  - The secret key is expected to be strong and kept confidential in production.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - The checksum’s effective length is insufficient (only 8 characters).
  - A stronger mitigation would be to use a longer (or full–length) digest or an alternate robust signing mechanism that is not vulnerable to targeted brute–force collision attacks.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The application must be running in an environment where AJAX requests can be intercepted or modified (e.g., misconfigured network/CSRF settings).
  - The attacker must be able to send forged AJAX request payloads.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `django_unicorn/utils.py`, the function `generate_checksum(data)` computes a SHA256 HMAC using Django’s secret key, converts the digest via ShortUUID, and then truncates it to 8 characters.
  - In `django_unicorn/views/objects.py`, when a component’s payload is received, its checksum (extracted from the request) is compared to the result of `generate_checksum(self.data)`. Because only an 8–character checksum is used, the collision space is small enough for an attacker to guess correct values with feasible brute–force attempts.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Use a tool (e.g., a scripted AJAX client) to capture a valid component update request including its payload and checksum.
  2. Modify the payload (for example, change a field’s value) and iteratively adjust candidate checksum values until the brute–forced 8–character checksum matches the value expected by the server.
  3. Replay the forged payload with the matching checksum.
  4. Confirm that the server accepts the request—demonstrating that the integrity check is bypassable via brute–force.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Deserialization via Pickle in Component Caching
  **Description:**
  To support caching of component state across AJAX calls, the framework serializes (pickles) entire component objects and stores them in Django’s caching backend. When a component is later restored via `restore_from_cache()`, the pickled object is directly deserialized without any integrity or authenticity check. An attacker with the ability to poison or inject malicious pickle data (for example, via a misconfigured, publicly accessible caching system) can force the framework to deserialize untrusted data.
  **Impact:**
  Malicious pickle payloads can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application. If an attacker is able to write to or modify the caching backend (e.g., Redis or Memcached), they could fully compromise the system.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The caching mechanism uses Django’s caching backend. The design assumes that the cache is secured and isolated from untrusted users.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - No cryptographic signing or additional integrity verification is performed on the pickled data before deserialization.
  - The project does not enforce a “safe pickle” mode or alternative serialization (such as JSON) for component state, which would mitigate risks if the cache is compromised.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must be able to write to, poison, or replace entries in the cache (e.g., through misconfiguration or insecure exposure of caching services).
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `django_unicorn/cacher.py`, the component’s state is pickled and stored in the cache via Django’s caching API.
  - When the component is restored, `restore_from_cache()` is called and the data is unpickled directly without verifying its integrity, opening the door to insecure deserialization attacks.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. In a controlled environment, configure the Django cache to use a network–accessible backend (for example, Redis or Memcached without proper authentication).
  2. Using a separate client to simulate an attacker, replace or inject a malicious pickle payload into the cache key corresponding to a stored component state.
  3. Trigger a request that causes the component to restore from the cache.
  4. Verify that the malicious payload executes its embedded system commands during unpickling, demonstrating the vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Excessive Information Disclosure in Error Responses
  **Description:**
  The framework’s error handling for component requests is implemented via a global decorator that catches exceptions (e.g., `UnicornViewError`, `ComponentClassLoadError`, and `AssertionError`) and returns their messages in JSON responses. An attacker can intentionally trigger errors (for example, by requesting a nonexistent component or by sending malformed payloads) and obtain detailed error messages that expose internal configuration details such as module paths, class names, and the list of attempted component locations.
  **Impact:**
  Acquiring detailed internal error messages allows an attacker to gain insights into the framework’s architecture and file structure. This information may facilitate further targeted attempts to bypass security controls or exploit other vulnerabilities (for example, component loading logic weaknesses).
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The framework uses CSRF protection and other safeguards on its public endpoints; however, the error handling mechanism (via the `handle_error` decorator in `django_unicorn/views/__init__.py`) directly returns the full error message (i.e., `str(e)`) in its JSON responses.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - The error responses should be sanitized and generalized to avoid leaking internal details. In production, detailed error information should be logged server–side only, with client–facing responses limited to a generic error message such as “An error occurred. Please try again later.”
  **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must be able to send crafted POST requests to the framework’s public message endpoint.
  - The application must be configured (or misconfigured) to return detailed error messages rather than generic notices in its production environment.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `django_unicorn/django_unicorn/views/__init__.py`, the function `handle_error` wraps the message view. When an exception occurs, it returns a JSON response where the “error” field is set to `str(e)`.
  - For example, a missing component name triggers an `AssertionError` whose message (e.g., “Missing component name in url”) is transmitted directly back to the client.
  - Similarly, when a component class cannot be loaded, the raised `ComponentClassLoadError` includes detailed diagnostic information (such as attempted module and class names), which is also exposed in the JSON response.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Using a tool such as Postman or cURL, send a POST request to the unicorn message endpoint (e.g., `/message/<component>`) with an intentionally malformed payload (for example, omitting the required component name or specifying an invalid component name like `"nonexistent-component"`).
  2. Ensure that the request headers include the appropriate `Content-Type: application/json` and a valid CSRF token, if required.
  3. Examine the JSON response and verify that the “error” field contains detailed internal information (such as file paths, module names, or component search locations).
  4. Validate that the detailed error output could be leveraged by an attacker to map the framework’s internals, indicating the need for more sanitized error responses in production.
