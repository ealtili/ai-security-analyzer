Below is the updated list of vulnerabilities that match the criteria (they are both part of the attack vector via a malicious local workspace configuration and are rated as high or critical):

### **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Deno Executable Path Configuration
**Description:**
An attacker who can supply or modify the workspace’s configuration (for example, via a malicious .vscode/settings.json) can set the `deno.path` configuration to point to an attacker‐controlled executable (or a relative path that resolves to one). When the extension starts the language server or creates Deno tasks, it calls the function that obtains the Deno executable path (see `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` and `getDenoCommandPath()` in **util.ts**). These functions simply check that the file exists but perform no content validation or whitelisting. Thus, the extension will launch whatever executable its configuration points to.

**Impact:**
The extension will run an arbitrary executable with the privileges of the VS Code extension host. An attacker could obtain full code execution on the victim’s machine.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The code attempts to resolve relative paths and validates file existence (using `fs.stat`) before returning the executable path.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- No sanitization or whitelisting of the executable’s identity is performed.
- There is no signature verification or check against an approved list of known “Deno” binaries.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must be able to modify the workspace configuration (for example, by providing a malicious .vscode/settings.json).
- The victim must open that workspace so that the extension loads the attacker-controlled settings.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In **util.ts**, the function `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` retrieves the setting `"deno.path"` directly from the workspace configuration.
- In `getDenoCommandPath()`, if a relative path is provided the extension loops over workspace folders to resolve it but does not validate that the resulting file is in an expected location or is the trusted Deno executable.
- This unsanitized path is then passed to `vscode.ProcessExecution` (for example, in the language server’s startup call in **commands.ts** and when building tasks in **tasks.ts**), which will spawn the process without further validation.

**Security Test Case:**
- In a controlled test environment, create a workspace with a .vscode/settings.json file that sets `"deno.path"` to the path of a malware-mimicking executable (for example, a shell script that writes a file or echoes a message).
- Open the workspace in VS Code so that the extension is activated.
- Verify that the extension uses the supplied executable (for example, by detecting the side effect of the malicious executable’s code).
- Confirm that malicious code is executed, thereby proving the vulnerability.

### **Vulnerability Name:** Command Argument Injection via Malicious Configuration Options
**Description:**
Several command–line arguments for the Deno CLI are assembled directly from configuration values (for example, the `"importMap"`, the array in `"codeLens.testArgs"`, and the `"unstable"` settings) with little or no sanitization. In the test command (in **commands.ts**), the value of `"importMap"` is trimmed and pushed directly into an argument array. Although the extension uses VS Code’s ProcessExecution API (which passes arguments as an array rather than a combined shell string), if the underlying Deno CLI concatenates or interprets these arguments unsafely (or if it uses a shell internally), then a specially crafted input could be misinterpreted as a malicious flag or even contain injection payloads.

**Impact:**
If exploited, the attacker can force the Deno CLI to interpret injected flags or payload strings. This may result in unexpected behavior—including the execution of arbitrary commands—if the Deno CLI does not strictly sanitize its own arguments.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The extension uses `vscode.ProcessExecution` with a provided array of arguments rather than constructing a single shell command string.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- There is no explicit input validation or sanitization of configuration values (for example, the contents of `"importMap"`) before they are added to the arguments array.
- No whitelisting or strict type-checking is performed to ensure that only safe values are passed.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must be able to modify the workspace configuration file (for example, the deno.json or .vscode/settings.json) to supply malicious strings in settings such as `"importMap"`.
- The vulnerability depends on the possibility that the Deno CLI (or any downstream tool) misinterprets its argument array in a way that leads to command injection.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In **commands.ts** (inside the `test` function), the extension reads configuration values using `config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs")` and `config.get("unstable")` and directly iterates over them to append flags such as `--unstable-<feature>`.
- The `"importMap"` value is also read, trimmed, and appended as two separate tokens (`"--import-map"` and the trimmed value) to the testArgs array.
- These flags and the constructed regex (for filtering tests) are then passed as elements of an array to the ProcessExecution call when building a Deno task (using `buildDenoTask` in **tasks.ts**).

**Security Test Case:**
- In a controlled environment, set up a malicious configuration file (deno.json or .vscode/settings.json) in which the `"importMap"` field is set to a string that embeds an injection payload (for example, a value like `"./innocent.json; rm -rf /tmp/malicious"`).
- Trigger the test command (for example, by invoking the Deno test Code Lens).
- Verify—using logs or monitored side effects—that the payload causes the Deno CLI to execute unexpected commands.
- Document that the unsanitized configuration value leads to injection when the Deno CLI mishandles its argument array.
