## 1. PHP Code Execution via Malicious Project Files

**Description:**
The extension gathers Laravel information by calling a helper function (e.g. `Helpers.runLaravel`) that checks for the existence of critical files (such as `vendor/autoload.php` and `bootstrap/app.php`) and then builds a PHP command by concatenating strings—including file paths obtained from functions like `Helpers.projectPath`. An attacker can supply a manipulated repository containing tampered critical files (for example, a modified `bootstrap/app.php` that embeds extra PHP instructions). Once the extension loads the project, it assembles and executes a PHP command (via Node’s `cp.exec`), inadvertently including and executing the attacker’s embedded payload.

*Step by step trigger:*
1. An attacker creates a repository that appears to be a valid Laravel project but replaces key files (e.g. `bootstrap/app.php`) with malicious versions that include embedded payloads.
2. The attacker publishes/distributes this repository.
3. The victim opens the repository in VSCode; the extension auto-detects a Laravel project and calls helper functions such as `Helpers.runLaravel`.
4. The extension assembles a PHP command that uses `require_once` with paths resolved by `Helpers.projectPath`.
5. The PHP interpreter executes the command and, in the process, runs the malicious payload embedded in one or more critical files.

**Impact:**
Exploitation leads to remote code execution (RCE) in the context of the PHP interpreter. An attacker may perform unauthorized file system operations, execute arbitrary commands, escalate privileges, or otherwise compromise the victim’s development environment.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- A security note is present in the README advising users to disable the extension when working with sensitive or untrusted code.
- No runtime integrity checks or sandboxing is applied to the project files before they are included.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Verification of file integrity (e.g. using digital signatures) for critical Laravel files before including them into the PHP command.
- Isolation or sandboxing of the PHP execution context to limit the impact of any injected code.
- Automatic warning or halting of processing when untrusted repositories are opened.

**Preconditions:**
- The victim opens a repository containing manipulated or malicious Laravel project files (for example, in `bootstrap/app.php` or `vendor/autoload.php`).
- The file system paths used by the helper functions resolve to these manipulated files.
- No external protection (such as sandboxing or strict integrity checks) is in place to prevent the inclusion of malicious code.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In the function `Helpers.runLaravel` (located in *helpers.ts*), the extension first verifies the existence of key Laravel files.
- It constructs a PHP command by concatenating strings such as:
  ```javascript
  "define('LARAVEL_START', microtime(true));" +
  "require_once '" + Helpers.projectPath("vendor/autoload.php", true) + "';" +
  "$app = require_once '" + Helpers.projectPath("bootstrap/app.php", true) + "';" +
  // … additional PHP code …
  ```
- The command is then passed to Node’s `cp.exec` for execution.
- If files like `bootstrap/app.php` have been maliciously modified, their payload becomes part of the executed command.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Create a test Laravel repository and modify `bootstrap/app.php` to include a payload (for example, by inserting before the normal code):
   ```php
   <?php file_put_contents('/tmp/pwned.txt', 'hacked'); ?>
   ```
2. Open this repository in VSCode so that the extension detects it as a Laravel project.
3. Trigger any extension feature that invokes `Helpers.runLaravel` (for example, by requesting autocompletion for routes or views).
4. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned.txt` exists with the content “hacked.”
5. The appearance of the file confirms that the embedded payload was executed.

## 2. PHP Command Injection via phpCommand Setting

**Description:**
The extension retrieves the PHP command template from the workspace configuration setting `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand`. By default, this value is set to something similar to:
```
php -r "{code}"
```
The extension simply performs a string replacement—substituting the `{code}` placeholder with generated PHP code—and then passes the resulting string to `cp.exec`. An attacker can supply a malicious repository (for example, through a manipulated `.vscode/settings.json` file) that overrides this configuration value with an injected payload. For instance, if the configuration is modified to:
```json
{
  "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}; system('echo INJECTED');\""
}
```
after replacing `{code}`, the resulting command will execute the intended PHP code and, immediately afterward, run the extra shell command (e.g. `system('echo INJECTED');`).

*Step by step trigger:*
1. The attacker commits a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file into the repository that overrides `phpCommand` with an injected command.
2. The victim opens the repository in VSCode; workspace settings are automatically loaded.
3. An extension feature triggers the function `Helpers.runPhp`, which reads the malicious configuration, substitutes `{code}` with generated PHP code, and constructs the final command.
4. The command—now containing the injected extra shell command—is executed by `cp.exec`, and the extra command runs.

**Impact:**
An attacker–controlled configuration value enables arbitrary shell command execution with the same privileges as the VSCode process. This may lead to data exfiltration, file modification, or full system compromise.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The extension performs simple replacement and minimal escaping (e.g. of quotes) when substituting `{code}` but does not sanitize the entire command template.
- A general security note exists in the README, but it does not prevent misuse of configuration values.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Input validation or whitelisting of acceptable formats for the `phpCommand` configuration.
- Use of secure command-building methods that avoid direct shell concatenation (for example, by using parameterized calls or strict templating).
- Ignoring nonstandard overrides or alerting the user when unsafe command syntax is detected.

**Preconditions:**
- The victim must open a repository supplying a malicious workspace configuration that overrides `phpCommand`.
- The extension must execute the code path in `Helpers.runPhp` that performs the substitution and calls `cp.exec`.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `helpers.ts` within the function `runPhp`, the extension retrieves the configuration:
  ```javascript
  let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
  ```
- A simple string replacement is performed:
  ```javascript
  let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);
  ```
- The command is then executed via:
  ```javascript
  cp.exec(command, …);
  ```
- Because no proper sanitization is done, an attacker–supplied configuration can append extra shell commands.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Set up a test repository that includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file with:
   ```json
   {
     "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}; system('echo INJECTED');\""
   }
   ```
2. Open the repository in VSCode.
3. Trigger an extension operation that runs PHP code (for example, refreshing an autocomplete feature that depends on PHP output).
4. Monitor the output (via the extension’s output channel or console logs) to verify that “INJECTED” is printed or otherwise observed.
5. The appearance of the injected output confirms successful command injection.

## 3. PHP Code Injection via Unsanitized basePathForCode Configuration

**Description:**
The extension uses the configuration setting `LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode` to determine the base path used when constructing file paths that are embedded into PHP commands (for example, in `require_once` statements within `Helpers.runLaravel`). If an attacker supplies a malicious repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` that overrides this value using a string containing a closing single quote and extra PHP code, the concatenation into PHP code will be broken. For example, setting:
```json
{
  "LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode": "maliciousPath'; system('calc'); //"
}
```
could cause the constructed PHP code to become:
```php
require_once 'maliciousPath'; system('calc'); //vendor/autoload.php';
```
which executes attacker–controlled PHP instructions.

**Impact:**
Exploitation would result in arbitrary PHP code execution within the context of the extension/laravel application. This could allow the attacker to run any PHP code, leading to further system compromise.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- There is no sanitization or escaping of the `basePathForCode` configuration value before its use in PHP code generation.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Validate that `basePathForCode` conforms to an expected safe pattern (for example, a proper directory path without special characters).
- Escape any potentially dangerous characters (such as single quotes) before concatenating the configuration into PHP code.

**Preconditions:**
- The victim must open a repository containing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets an unsafe value for `basePathForCode`.
- The extension’s function (e.g. `Helpers.projectPath`) is used to build PHP code that includes the unsafe value.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `helpers.ts`, the method `Helpers.projectPath` retrieves the setting as follows:
  ```javascript
  let basePathForCode = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('basePathForCode');
  return basePathForCode + path;
  ```
- The unsanitized value is directly concatenated with a relative path, and later inserted into a PHP `require_once` statement without any escaping.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Prepare a test repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` file containing:
   ```json
   {
     "LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode": "maliciousPath'; system('echo INJECTED_BASE'); //"
   }
   ```
2. Open the repository in VSCode and trigger an action (such as model loading) that causes PHP code to be generated.
3. Verify whether the injected PHP payload (for instance, by checking for the “INJECTED_BASE” marker in logs or output) is executed.
4. Confirmation of the injected command’s effect proves the vulnerability.

## 4. PHP Code Injection via Unsanitized modelsPaths Configuration

**Description:**
The extension’s Eloquent provider reads the configuration setting `LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths` (typically an array indicating directories such as `app` or `app/Models`) from the workspace settings. When constructing a PHP array literal used within a dynamically generated PHP script, the values from `modelsPaths` are simply joined (e.g., via `join("', '")`) without any sanitization or escaping. If an attacker supplies a malicious entry such as:
```json
["app','; system('echo INJECTED_MODELS'); //"]
```
the injected payload will break out of the PHP string literal and execute arbitrary PHP code.

**Impact:**
Exploitation leads to arbitrary PHP code execution within the context of the Eloquent provider. This could trigger unauthorized system commands, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- No escaping or validation of the values from the `modelsPaths` configuration is performed before embedding them into the generated PHP code.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Strict validation of acceptable directory names.
- Proper escaping of special characters (such as single quotes) before constructing the PHP array literal.

**Preconditions:**
- The victim opens a repository with a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file that overrides `modelsPaths` with an entry containing injected PHP code.
- The extension subsequently builds a PHP script that uses these unsanitized values.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `src/EloquentProvider.ts`, the provider generates PHP code similar to:
  ```javascript
  "foreach (['" + vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense")
      .get<Array<string>>('modelsPaths', ['app', 'app/Models'])
      .join("', '") + "'] as $modelPath) { … }"
  ```
- The lack of sanitization means that any special characters in a supplied value will become part of the PHP code, causing erroneous interpretation and potential code injection.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Create a repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets:
   ```json
   {
     "LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths": [
       "app','; system('echo INJECTED_MODELS'); //"
     ]
   }
   ```
2. Open the repository in VSCode so that the Eloquent provider loads the model paths.
3. Trigger an action (such as code completion for models) that causes the PHP code incorporating the models paths to be executed.
4. Observe whether the injected PHP command is executed (for example, by detecting the “INJECTED_MODELS” marker).
5. The execution of the injected code confirms the vulnerability.

## 5. PHP Code Injection via Malicious Translation File/Directory Names

**Description:**
The TranslationProvider scans the project’s localization directories (for example, the `lang` folder) and collects translation group names from file and directory names. These names are then embedded directly into a PHP code snippet that maps translation keys to their corresponding values (e.g., by using the Laravel translation function `__()`). Because the file and directory names are not sanitarily processed, an attacker who controls the repository may create a translation file or directory with a crafted name (for example, including a single quote or extra PHP code like:
```
evil'); system('echo INJECTED_TRANSLATION'); //
```)
causing the PHP code to be malformed and the injected commands to execute.

**Impact:**
This vulnerability leads to arbitrary PHP code execution during the translation loading process. An attacker could leverage this to run unwanted PHP commands, which may result in a full remote code execution scenario.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- There is no sanitization or escaping of file or directory names when they are embedded into the PHP code snippet.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Proper validation and escaping of file names or translation keys prior to their use within dynamically generated PHP code.

**Preconditions:**
- The victim must open a repository where the translation files or directories have been renamed to include malicious payloads.
- The TranslationProvider must scan and process these names during its PHP code generation routine.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `src/TranslationProvider.ts`, the provider constructs PHP code similar to:
  ```javascript
  Helpers.runLaravel("echo json_encode([" +
    translationGroups.map((transGroup: string) =>
      "'" + transGroup + "' => __('" + transGroup + "')"
    ).join(",") +
  "]);", "Translations inside namespaces")
  ```
- Since `transGroup` (derived from directory or file names) is inserted between single quotes without escaping, a maliciously crafted name can break out of the literal and inject arbitrary PHP code.

**Security Test Case:**
1. In a test repository, create or rename a translation file/directory (e.g. under a `lang` folder) with a name such as:
   ```
   evil'); system('echo INJECTED_TRANSLATION'); //
   ```
2. Open the repository in VSCode so that the TranslationProvider processes the localization directories.
3. Trigger a feature (like code completion for translation keys) that causes the translation PHP code to be executed.
4. Check for the execution of the injected command—e.g. by verifying that the output contains “INJECTED_TRANSLATION.”
5. The presence of the marker confirms that the payload was injected and executed.

---

*Each of the above vulnerabilities arises from unsanitized use of user–controlled values (either from workspace configuration or directly derived from file system data) when dynamically generating PHP code. Addressing these issues requires rigorous validation, proper escaping, and the use of secure templating techniques to ensure that externally supplied values cannot modify the intended command structure.*
