# Combined Vulnerabilities List

Each vulnerability below demonstrates how an attacker can supply a malicious repository (for example, via a manipulated .vscode/settings.json file or crafted file/directory names) to trigger remote code execution (RCE), command injection, or PHP code injection in the VSCode extension.

## Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Command Injection via Overridable phpCommand Configuration

**Description:**
The extension retrieves its PHP executor command from the configuration value `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` and uses it as a command template in the `Helpers.runPhp()` function. A placeholder (`{code}`) is substituted with generated PHP code, but only minimal escaping (such as replacing double quotes and, on Unix, dollar signs) is performed on the generated code—not on the configuration value itself. This means that if an attacker supplies a malicious workspace (for example, by manipulating .vscode/settings.json), they can override the phpCommand template with extra shell instructions. For instance, setting the value to something like:

```
php -r "{code}"; echo 'MALICIOUS_INJECTION';
```

would cause the additional shell command (`echo 'MALICIOUS_INJECTION'`) to be executed when the extension calls Node’s `cp.exec()`.

**Impact:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Arbitrary system commands can be executed with the privileges of the VSCode process.
- **Full System Compromise / Data Exfiltration:** An attacker may leverage this to exfiltrate data or compromise the entire system.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The extension performs simple escapes on the generated PHP snippet (such as replacing double quotes and, in Unix environments, dollar signs) but does not validate or sanitize the entire `phpCommand` configuration value.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Lack of robust validation or sanitization of the `phpCommand` input.
- No whitelist or enforcement of a strict command format is applied.
- Safer execution strategies (e.g., parameterizing the command instead of using shell-interpolated strings) are not employed.

**Preconditions:**
- The victim opens a workspace containing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file that overrides the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting with an injected payload.
- An extension feature that invokes `Helpers.runPhp()` (for example, via autocompletion or another functionality) gets triggered.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. The configuration is retrieved without validation via:
   ```js
   let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace
       .getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense")
       .get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
   ```
2. The PHP code snippet is inserted using a simple replacement:
   ```js
   let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);
   ```
3. The final command is executed via Node’s `cp.exec()`:
   ```js
   cp.exec(command, { cwd: ... });
   ```
   Because the configuration value is used directly, an attacker–controlled template (with additional shell commands) will lead to arbitrary command execution.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Create a VSCode workspace with a `.vscode/settings.json` file containing:
   ```json
   {
     "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}\"; echo 'MALICIOUS_INJECTION';"
   }
   ```
2. Open this workspace in VSCode so that the extension loads the manipulated configuration.
3. Trigger a functionality that causes `Helpers.runPhp()` to execute (for example, by requesting code completion that causes the extension to run PHP code).
4. Verify that the output (e.g. in the extension’s output channel) includes the text “MALICIOUS_INJECTION”, confirming that the injected command was executed.

## Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary PHP Code Injection via Manipulated basePathForCode Configuration

**Description:**
The extension builds PHP code for bootstrapping the Laravel application in `Helpers.runLaravel()` by concatenating hard-coded fragments with file paths. It uses the configuration value `LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode` (retrieved via the `Helpers.projectPath()` function) without any sanitization. An attacker who supplies a crafted value—such as:

```
/evil/path'; system('touch /tmp/exploit');//
```

—can break out of the intended PHP string literal (used in statements like `require_once '...';`) and inject arbitrary PHP commands.

**Impact:**
- **Remote PHP Code Execution:** Arbitrary PHP commands can be executed within the Laravel context.
- **Elevated Privileges:** Depending on the PHP runtime, this may lead to full system compromise or unauthorized data access.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The extension resolves the configuration value (using Node’s path utilities) and performs simple string substitutions. No measures are taken to escape or validate the content against PHP string injection.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- No input validation or sanitization of the `basePathForCode` setting.
- No escaping of special characters to ensure the injected value does not break out of PHP string literals.
- Lack of a whitelist for allowable path formats.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker supplies a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` that sets `LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode` to an injected payload.
- The victim then opens this workspace, and the extension proceeds with its normal operation (such as bootstrapping Laravel using `runLaravel()`).

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `Helpers.projectPath()`, the configuration value is obtained:
   ```js
   let basePathForCode = vscode.workspace
       .getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense")
       .get<string>('basePathForCode');
   return basePathForCode + path;
   ```
2. Within `Helpers.runLaravel()`, the PHP code is constructed using the unsanitized value:
   ```php
   require_once '" + Helpers.projectPath("vendor/autoload.php", true) + "';
   ```
3. If `basePathForCode` holds a malicious payload, for example:
   ```php
   require_once '/evil/path'; system('touch /tmp/exploit');//vendor/autoload.php';
   ```
   the injected PHP command (`system('touch /tmp/exploit');`) is executed.

**Security Test Case:**
1. In a test workspace, create a `.vscode/settings.json` containing:
   ```json
   {
     "LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode": "/var/www/html'; system('echo INJECTED'); //"
   }
   ```
2. Open the workspace in VSCode so that the extension loads the altered configuration.
3. Trigger an extension feature that calls `Helpers.runLaravel()` (e.g., by performing an action that boots the Laravel application).
4. Verify that the injected command is executed (for instance, by checking that “INJECTED” is echoed or by observing the creation of a test file).

## Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary PHP Code Injection via Malicious Translation File Names

**Description:**
The TranslationProvider scans language directories (e.g., “lang” or “translations”) and constructs a PHP command string that maps each translation group name to a call of Laravel’s translation helper function (`__()`). The file or directory names are directly concatenated into the PHP string literal without any sanitization. If an attacker supplies a translation file or directory name containing special characters (such as single quotes, semicolons, or other PHP control characters), the resulting PHP code can be broken out of its intended context and arbitrary PHP commands can be injected.

**Impact:**
- **PHP Code Injection:** Arbitrary PHP code can be executed within the Laravel process.
- **Remote Code Execution:** This may allow attackers to compromise the PHP runtime, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- No escaping or validation is performed on the translation file/directory names when they are inserted into the PHP string used to build the command.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Lack of proper sanitization or escaping of translation group names before embedding them in PHP code.
- No validation to ensure that file/directory names contain only expected characters.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker controls the repository contents by providing translation files or directories with malicious names (for example:
  ```
  bad', system('touch /tmp/injected'), '
  ```
  ).
- When the TranslationProvider processes these names, it constructs unsanitized PHP code.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. The TranslationProvider gathers an array of translation group names from the language directories.
2. It then constructs a PHP command using:
   ```js
   Helpers.runLaravel("echo json_encode([" + translationGroups.map((transGroup: string) => "'" + transGroup + "' => __('" + transGroup + "')").join(",") + "]);", "Translations inside namespaces")
   ```
3. Since each translation group name is concatenated between single quotes without escaping, a malicious name can break out of the intended PHP context and inject arbitrary PHP.

**Security Test Case:**
1. In a controlled test environment, add a translation file (or directory) with a name such as:
   ```
   bad', system('touch /tmp/injected'), '
   ```
   to the appropriate language folder (e.g., “lang/en”).
2. Open the test repository in VSCode so that the TranslationProvider detects the malicious translation group.
3. Trigger the translation loading process (for instance, by invoking a feature that uses the translation data).
4. Check for evidence of PHP code injection (for example, verify that the file `/tmp/injected` is created).

## Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary PHP Code Injection via Manipulated modelsPaths Configuration

**Description:**
Within the `EloquentProvider.loadModels` method, the extension dynamically builds a PHP snippet that is used to load Eloquent models. This snippet is constructed by retrieving the configuration value `LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths` (which defaults to `[ "app", "app/Models" ]`) and concatenating its elements into a PHP array literal. Since these values are embedded directly between PHP single quotes without any escaping, an attacker who supplies a malicious `modelsPaths` value (for example, injecting a single quote followed by arbitrary PHP code) can break out of the intended string context and execute arbitrary PHP commands.

**Impact:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Arbitrary PHP code can be executed within the context of the Laravel application.
- **Host Compromise:** This may lead to a full compromise of the Laravel application and potentially the underlying host system.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The extension presumes that the configuration values for `modelsPaths` are safe and does not sanitize or validate them before they are embedded into the dynamically generated PHP code.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- No proper validation or sanitization is performed on the entries in `modelsPaths`.
- There is no escaping of special characters (especially single quotes) that might allow breaking out of PHP string literals.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker supplies a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` that overrides `LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths` with an injected value such as:
   ```json
   {
     "LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths": ["app', system('echo INJECTED'); //"]
   }
   ```
- The victim opens this workspace in VSCode, causing `EloquentProvider.loadModels` to process the manipulated configuration.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `EloquentProvider.loadModels`, the PHP code is built as follows:
   ```js
   Helpers.runLaravel(
     "foreach (['" +
     vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<Array<string>>('modelsPaths', ['app', 'app/Models']).join("', '") +
     "'] as $modelPath) { ... }",
     "Eloquent Attributes and Relations"
   )
   ```
2. Because the configuration values are concatenated directly into the PHP single–quoted string, a malicious entry containing a single quote can break out and inject additional PHP commands.

**Security Test Case:**
1. In a controlled test environment, create a `.vscode/settings.json` that sets:
   ```json
   {
     "LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths": ["app', system('echo INJECTED'); //"]
   }
   ```
2. Open this workspace in VSCode so that the extension reads the manipulated `modelsPaths` configuration.
3. Trigger the functionality that causes `EloquentProvider.loadModels` to execute (for example, by waiting for the periodic refresh or by manually reloading models).
4. Check the extension’s output or system logs for evidence (e.g., the text “INJECTED”) that confirms the PHP injection was successful.
