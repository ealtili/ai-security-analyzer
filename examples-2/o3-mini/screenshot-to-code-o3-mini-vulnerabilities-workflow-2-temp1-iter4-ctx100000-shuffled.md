Below is the combined list of vulnerabilities (duplicates have been merged):

---

## 1. Malicious Crafted Image Injection Leading to Remote Code Execution

**Description:**
An attacker can supply a specially crafted image (embedded as a base64 data URL) to vulnerable endpoints (for example, the `/api/screenshot` endpoint or the WebSocket `/generate-code` endpoint). In the function `process_image()` (located in `backend/image_processing/utils.py`), the image is decoded and passed to the Pillow library via `Image.open` without strict validation of its metadata or structure. By exploiting weaknesses in the image library—or by crafting image metadata in an unexpected way—the downstream AI prompt may be manipulated or, in a worst-case scenario, trigger remote code execution when the image is later embedded into generated code.

**Impact:**
- An attacker may inject malicious code (such as JavaScript) leading to cross–site scripting (XSS) or remote code execution on the backend.
- Client devices could be compromised if the generated HTML is rendered without additional sanitization, and the backend resources may be abused.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The application enforces basic file size and dimension checks using constants (e.g. `CLAUDE_IMAGE_MAX_SIZE` and `CLAUDE_MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION`).
- However, no verification is performed on the actual content or metadata of the image.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Strict validation and sanitization for all image inputs (for example, validating MIME types, enforcing safe image header formats, and processing images in a sandboxed environment).
- Ensuring that the image library (Pillow) is kept up-to–date with patches addressing known vulnerabilities.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must be able to supply an image (as a base64–encoded data URL) via the `/api/screenshot` endpoint or the client-side code generation endpoint.
- The targeted image processing library (Pillow) must possess exploitable weaknesses or the absence of sanitization must permit unintended payloads.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `backend/image_processing/utils.py`, the function `process_image` receives image bytes from a user–supplied data URL and calls `Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes))` without validating that the bytes represent a proper image.
- The image is then resized and saved as JPEG without recoding or sanitizing its metadata.
- Additionally, in `backend/prompts/__init__.py`, the unsanitized `image_data_url` is directly inserted into the prompt messages destined for the LLM.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Craft an image file that embeds a malicious payload (for example, a script injected into EXIF metadata or a malformed structure known to trigger vulnerabilities in Pillow).
2. Encode this file into a base64 data URL and submit it via a POST request to `/api/screenshot` or through the WebSocket endpoint used for code generation.
3. Monitor backend logs and inspect the generated HTML output for any anomalies or injected script content.
4. In a controlled testing environment, render the output HTML and verify whether the malicious payload executes (e.g. by triggering an alert).

## 2. Uncontrolled Prompt Injection and AI Code Generation Leading to Code Injection and XSS

**Description:**
The system accepts multiple user–supplied parameters (including those in the `image`, `resultImage`, and `history` fields) without proper sanitization. These values are used verbatim when constructing prompts for the language model by functions such as `create_prompt()` and `assemble_prompt()` in `backend/prompts/__init__.py`. This lack of sanitization enables an attacker to inject malicious payloads into the generated prompt. When the language model produces code based on these prompts, the resulting HTML/JavaScript may include dangerous scripts that, once rendered in a client’s browser, can lead to cross–site scripting (XSS) or other forms of code injection.

**Impact:**
- Generated content may contain malicious `<script>` tags or other executable code that can run in the victim’s browser.
- The attack can lead to session hijacking, theft of sensitive information, unintended user actions, or even remote code execution in certain contexts if backend processes act on it.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- Basic type and value checks are performed on some parameters (for example, ensuring certain fields like `generatedCodeConfig` and `inputMode` have expected values).
- However, key fields such as `image`, `resultImage`, and `history` are not sanitized or encoded before being embedded into prompts.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Implementation of strict input validation and output sanitization (for instance, using libraries to escape or clean HTML/JavaScript content) for all parameters used in prompt construction.
- Enforcement of a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) and use of techniques (such as output encoding) to prevent execution of injected scripts.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must have access to the web interface or API (e.g. the WebSocket `/generate-code` endpoint) that allows submission of controlled input.
- The backend relies on the AI model to generate HTML/JS code solely based on the provided prompt without any further filtering or sanitization.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `backend/prompts/__init__.py`, functions like `create_prompt()` iterate over user–supplied content (for example, entries in `params["history"]`) and append them directly to the prompt without any sanitization.
- Similarly, in the WebSocket endpoint (located in `backend/routes/generate_code.py`), unsanitized inputs (including the image data URL) are packaged into prompt messages sent to the LLM, and the resulting HTML is extracted by functions such as `extract_html_content()` and transmitted unmodified to clients.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Connect to the `/generate-code` WebSocket endpoint using a tool (for example, a WebSocket client).
2. Craft and send a JSON payload where one or more controlled inputs (e.g. an `image` data URL or a `history` entry) contains a malicious payload such as `"<script>alert('XSS')</script>"`.
3. Intercept and inspect the assembled prompt to confirm that the injected content appears in the transmitted data.
4. Capture the AI-generated output over the WebSocket and verify whether it incorporates the dangerous payload.
5. In a controlled environment, render the returned HTML in a browser and observe if the injected script executes (e.g., by displaying an alert).

## 3. SSRF via Misconfigured OPENAI_BASE_URL Parameter

**Description:**
In non–production deployments, the application allows user–supplied overrides for the OpenAI base URL via the settings dialog or environment file. An attacker can submit a malicious URL (for example, `"http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1"`) that points to an internal or attacker–controlled server. Since the protection is only enforced in production (when `IS_PROD` is true), the provided URL is accepted and used by the backend when calling the AsyncOpenAI client.

**Impact:**
- The backend may inadvertently send API calls intended for OpenAI to an internal network resource or an attacker–controlled server.
- This can lead to information disclosure from internal systems, unauthorized access, or manipulation of internal communications via a Server–Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- In production deployments (with `IS_PROD` set to true), user–supplied overrides for `openAiBaseURL` are disabled.
- The system falls back to a predefined environment variable value if no client input is provided.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Absence of rigorous validation or whitelisting of the URL on non–production systems.
- No restrictions enforcing the URL scheme (such as HTTPS), domain, or IP address (to block internal/private addresses), nor any check for a required URL path component (like “/v1”).

**Preconditions:**
- The application must be deployed in a non–production configuration (with `IS_PROD` set to false) that permits client–supplied `openAiBaseURL` values.
- The attacker has access to the frontend settings dialog or API endpoint that accepts this parameter.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `backend/routes/generate_code.py`, the function (e.g. `extract_params`) conditionally populates the `openai_base_url` by calling `get_from_settings_dialog_or_env` when `IS_PROD` is false.
- The resulting URL is then passed directly to the AsyncOpenAI client (in functions such as `stream_openai_response` in `backend/llm.py`), without validation against a whitelist or proper format checking.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Deploy a test instance of the application in non–production mode (ensure `IS_PROD` is false).
2. Connect to the code generation endpoint (for example, via the WebSocket `/generate-code` endpoint).
3. In the JSON payload, set the `"openAiBaseURL"` field to a malicious URL such as `"http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1"`.
4. Use network monitoring or an intercepting proxy to verify that the backend instantiates the OpenAI client with the supplied URL and makes outbound API calls accordingly.
5. Confirm that requests are directed to internal endpoints as a result.

## 4. SSRF via Unvalidated URL Parameter in Screenshot API

**Description:**
The `/api/screenshot` endpoint accepts a JSON payload containing a `"url"` field that is passed unvalidated to the `capture_screenshot` function (located in `backend/routes/screenshot.py`). An attacker can provide a URL that targets internal network resources (for example, `http://localhost/admin` or an internal IP address). Since the URL is not checked against any safe domain or IP filtering, the backend may inadvertently forward the request to sensitive internal resources.

**Impact:**
- The backend might initiate network requests to internal services that are not normally accessible from the outside, potentially disclosing sensitive data or allowing internal network reconnaissance.
- This could pave the way for further exploitation of internal services.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- No sanitization or filtering of the `"url"` parameter is implemented in the `ScreenshotRequest` model or within the `capture_screenshot` function.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Input validation to restrict the `"url"` parameter to a whitelist of safe domains or to reject URLs pointing to internal or private IP ranges.
- Additional network–level restrictions (for instance, limiting outbound requests) or safe URL parsing routines.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the `/api/screenshot` endpoint with an arbitrary `"url"` parameter.
- The external screenshot API (e.g. https://api.screenshotone.com/take) must be reachable from the backend.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `backend/routes/screenshot.py`, the function `capture_screenshot` constructs a set of request parameters directly from the user–supplied `"url"`, for example:
  ```python
  params = {
      "access_key": api_key,
      "url": target_url,
      "full_page": "true",
      ...
  }
  async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=60) as client:
      response = await client.get(api_base_url, params=params)
  ```
- The absence of validation means that an attacker can control the destination of the backend’s outbound request.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Send a POST request to the `/api/screenshot` endpoint with the following JSON payload:
   ```json
   {
     "url": "http://127.0.0.1:80/admin",
     "apiKey": "valid_api_key"
   }
   ```
2. Monitor network logs or the behavior of internal endpoints to verify that the backend issues a request to the supplied URL.
3. Check the response to determine if sensitive or confidential data from internal services is inadvertently disclosed.
4. Document the successful SSRF by capturing the request and the backend’s response.
