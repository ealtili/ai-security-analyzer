# Combined Vulnerabilities

The following list combines vulnerabilities from two sources, eliminating duplicates while preserving all critical details. Each vulnerability is described with its name, detailed steps on how it may be triggered, its impact, rank, currently implemented mitigations, missing mitigations, preconditions, a step‑by‑step source code analysis, and a security test case that an external attacker could perform on a publicly accessible instance of the application.

## 1. Insecure Deserialization via Pickle Caching

**Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Deserialization via Pickle Caching

**Description:**
The framework caches fully instantiated component view instances—including the complete “tree” of child components—by serializing (pickling) their state and storing the resulting binary blob in the cache backend. An attacker who can poison or overwrite a cache entry (for example, by exploiting a misconfigured, publicly accessible, or unprotected cache backend) can inject a malicious pickle payload. When the component is later restored via `restore_from_cache()`, the unverified payload is deserialized using `pickle.loads()`, thereby triggering arbitrary code execution.

*Step by step trigger:*
1. Ensure that component caching is enabled in the application settings (via flags like `UNICORN` or `CACHE_ALIAS`).
2. Use a publicly accessible or misconfigured cache backend (e.g., Redis or Memcached without proper isolation).
3. Identify a cache key corresponding to a component state (often formatted as `"unicorn:component:<component_id>"`).
4. Replace or inject a malicious pickle payload crafted with a dangerous `__reduce__` method into the cache using an external client.
5. Trigger the component’s restoration (e.g., by sending an AJAX request that causes `restore_from_cache()` to execute), which leads to deserialization of the malicious payload.

**Impact:**
An attacker with control over the cached blob may execute arbitrary code on the server. This could result in full system compromise, including unauthorized data reading, modification or deletion of application data, and lateral movement within the internal network.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The cache backend is assumed to be secured—typically placed on a private network with properly configured caching services like Memcached or Redis.
- Component caching is opt‑in, meaning developers are expected to enable it only when secure backends are used in production.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- There is no intrinsic verification (e.g., cryptographic signing or a message authentication code) performed on the pickled blob before deserialization.
- No alternative safe serialization format (such as JSON) is offered for storing the component state.

**Preconditions:**
- Component caching must be enabled in the application configuration.
- The deployed caching backend must be misconfigured or insufficiently firewalled, thereby allowing external write access.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In the file `django_unicorn/cacher.py`, the class `CacheableComponent` uses `pickle.dumps(component)` to serialize both the component and its child components before storing them.
2. Later, when the component is restored, the framework retrieves the cached data and directly calls `pickle.loads()` without performing any checks for data integrity or authenticity.
3. Since the native Python pickle module is unsafe when deserializing untrusted data, an injected malicious pickle payload will result in the execution of arbitrary code during restoration.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Configure the Django instance to use a cache backend that is publicly accessible (for example, a Redis or Memcached instance without proper authentication or network restrictions).
2. Enable component caching by setting appropriate flags (e.g., UNICORN settings) so that component states are stored in the cache.
3. Identify the cache key corresponding to a target component (commonly formatted as `"unicorn:component:<component_id>"`).
4. From an external client, overwrite the cache entry with a crafted malicious pickle payload (designed to execute a benign system command for testing purposes) using a tool or script.
5. Trigger the component’s rendering—such as by issuing an appropriate AJAX request that leads to `restore_from_cache()`—so that the malicious payload is deserialized.
6. Verify that the payload is executed by checking the appropriate server logs or side effects from the benign system command.

## 2. Insufficient Checksum Length Allowing Data Tampering

**Vulnerability Name:** Insufficient Checksum Length Allowing Data Tampering

**Description:**
The framework’s request integrity mechanism employs an HMAC-SHA256 checksum computed over component data. However, after generating the full digest, the framework converts it using ShortUUID and utilizes only the first eight characters. This dramatic truncation substantially reduces the collision resistance of the checksum. An attacker intercepting or modifying AJAX requests can iteratively adjust the payload and then brute–force a matching truncated checksum to bypass integrity checks.

*Step by step trigger:*
1. Intercept a valid component update AJAX request that includes the payload and its 8-character checksum.
2. Modify the payload—for example, change a field value.
3. Use automated or manual brute-force techniques to search for an 8-character checksum that matches the recalculated checksum (given the severe reduction in available checksum space).
4. Replay the forged request with the matching checksum.

**Impact:**
Successfully forging a payload with a weak 8-character checksum allows an attacker to bypass integrity checks. This may lead to unauthorized data tampering, unintended execution of component actions, or corrupting the application state. Such an exploitation path could be leveraged for further system compromise.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The checksum is generated using HMAC with Django’s secret key, with the expectation that the secret key is strong and kept confidential in the production environment.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Truncating the checksum to only 8 characters severely undermines the checksum’s effectiveness against brute-force collisions.
- Using a longer (or full-length) digest or implementing an alternate robust signing mechanism would greatly improve resistance to targeted brute-force attacks.

**Preconditions:**
- The application must be deployed in an environment where AJAX requests can be intercepted or modified (such as with insufficient CSRF protection or misconfigured network settings).
- The attacker must be capable of sending forged AJAX request payloads.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `django_unicorn/utils.py`, the function `generate_checksum(data)` calculates an HMAC-SHA256 digest using Django’s secret key.
2. The computed digest is then converted using ShortUUID and truncated to the first 8 characters.
3. In `django_unicorn/views/objects.py`, when a component’s payload is received, its provided checksum is compared against this truncated value.
4. Due to the dramatically reduced checksum length, the collision space is small, enabling a brute-force approach to discover a matching checksum within practical time.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Capture a valid component update AJAX request using a tool or scripted client, noting both the payload and its 8-character checksum.
2. Modify the payload (for instance, alter a field value) and run iterative tests to generate candidate checksums until a matching 8-character checksum is found via brute-force.
3. Replay the forged payload with the matching checksum.
4. Confirm that the server accepts the forged request, thereby demonstrating that the integrity check is bypassable due to the weak truncated checksum.

## 3. Excessive Information Disclosure in Error Responses

**Vulnerability Name:** Excessive Information Disclosure in Error Responses

**Description:**
The framework’s error handling strategy utilizes a global decorator that catches various exceptions (such as `UnicornViewError`, `ComponentClassLoadError`, and `AssertionError`) and returns their full messages in JSON responses. An attacker can intentionally trigger these errors (for example, by submitting malformed payloads or requesting a nonexistent component) to obtain detailed error messages. These messages may reveal sensitive internal configuration details such as module paths, class names, and the list of attempted component locations.

*Step by step trigger:*
1. Use an external client (such as Postman or cURL) to send a POST request to the message endpoint (for example, `/message/<component>`) with an intentionally malformed payload (e.g., omitting the required component name or employing an invalid component identifier like `"nonexistent-component"`).
2. Ensure the request includes the proper `Content-Type: application/json` header and, if required, a valid CSRF token.
3. Analyze the JSON response for detailed error messages containing internal diagnostic information.

**Impact:**
Exposing detailed internal information via error responses can provide an attacker with critical insights into the framework’s internal architecture (including file paths, module names, and component loading logic). This knowledge can then be leveraged to design more targeted attacks or identify other vulnerabilities within the system.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The framework enforces CSRF protection and other safeguards on public endpoints.
- However, the error handling mechanism (via the `handle_error` decorator in `django_unicorn/views/__init__.py`) directly returns verbose error messages in the JSON response.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Error responses should be sanitized and generalized, avoiding exposure of internal implementation details.
- In production, detailed error information should be logged server–side only, while client-facing messages should be generic (e.g., “An error occurred. Please try again later.”).

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must be able to send crafted POST requests to the framework’s public message endpoint.
- The application must be configured (or misconfigured) such that detailed error messages are returned rather than a generic error response.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `django_unicorn/views/__init__.py`, the `handle_error` decorator wraps the message-handling endpoint.
2. When exceptions occur, the decorator catches them and constructs a JSON response where the “error” field is populated with the full string representation of the exception (i.e., using `str(e)`).
3. For instance, a missing component name will trigger an `AssertionError`, the full text of which (detailing the missing name and possibly context) is then sent back to the client.
4. Similarly, if a component class fails to load (raising a `ComponentClassLoadError`), all internal details regarding the attempted module and class names are revealed.

**Security Test Case:**
1. With Postman or cURL, send a POST request to the unicorn message endpoint (e.g., `/message/<component>`) that deliberately omits required fields or uses an invalid component name such as `"nonexistent-component"`.
2. Ensure that the request includes appropriate headers (`Content-Type: application/json`) and a valid CSRF token.
3. Observe the JSON response and check that the “error” field includes detailed internal error information (such as file paths, module names, or component search paths).
4. The presence of such detailed internal information demonstrates that the error handling mechanism is disclosing excessive information, which could be exploited by an attacker.
