# Combined Vulnerability List

The following vulnerabilities have been identified in the Laravel Extra Intellisense extension. They arise from two distinct attack vectors: one via unsafe configuration substitution that leads to command injection, and the other via the inclusion of malicious Laravel project files during the extension’s bootstrap process. Both vulnerabilities are high or critical in severity and can lead to arbitrary code execution on the developer’s machine.

## 1. Insecure PHP Command Injection via `phpCommand` Configuration Manipulation

### Description
The extension retrieves the PHP command template from the user’s configuration setting (`LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand`) and simply substitutes a placeholder (`{code}`) with dynamically generated PHP code. Because this substitution is performed with only basic escaping—and without any structural validation—the template can be maliciously modified. An attacker who manages to control the configuration (for example, via a compromised workspace settings file) can inject extra shell commands or PHP payloads. These injected commands are then executed via Node’s `cp.exec`, effectively allowing arbitrary code execution.

### Step-by-Step Trigger
1. **Configuration Access:**
   An attacker gains control over the extension’s configuration, for example by injecting a malicious workspace settings file or compromising user settings.
2. **Malicious Template Injection:**
   The attacker sets the `phpCommand` value to a modified template. For example:
   ```
   php -r "{code}; system('echo Vulnerable');"
   ```
   This embeds an extra shell command after the `{code}` placeholder.
3. **Code Substitution:**
   When the extension performs a PHP-related action (e.g., triggering autocompletion), it retrieves this template. The helper method replaces the `{code}` placeholder with dynamically generated PHP code using simple string replacement and minimal escaping.
4. **Command Execution:**
   The final, maliciously modified command is handed off to Node’s `cp.exec`, which spawns a shell and executes the command.
5. **Arbitrary Code Execution:**
   As a consequence, the injected payload (e.g., the `echo Vulnerable` command) is executed on the developer’s machine, potentially enabling further exploitation.

### Impact
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The attacker may run any PHP or shell commands on the local machine.
- **Developer Environment Compromise:** The attacker can escalate privileges, alter or delete files, install malware, or steal sensitive information.
- **Security Boundary Break:** Execution of injected commands outside the intended PHP context may lead to a broader system compromise.

### Vulnerability Rank
**Critical**

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- **Default Configuration:**
  The extension uses a default value (`php -r "{code}"`) if no configuration is provided.
- **Basic Escaping:**
  In the helper function (e.g., `Helpers.runPhp`), a rudimentary escaping (such as replacing `"` with `\"`) is applied to the PHP code. On Unix‑like systems, additional minimal escaping (e.g., for `$`) is performed.

### Missing Mitigations
- **Input/Configuration Sanitization:**
  No strict validation or sanitization is applied to the overall structure of the `phpCommand` setting.
- **Safe Process Spawning:**
  The command is executed using `cp.exec`, which invokes a shell. Using a safer API (such as `spawn` with an explicit argument list) would mitigate command injection.
- **Whitelisting/Hardcoded Templates:**
  There is no enforcement of a fixed, safe pattern for the PHP command.
- **Runtime Integrity Checks:**
  No checks are performed to verify that the constructed command does not include malicious extra commands.

### Preconditions
- The attacker must have the ability to modify the VS Code configuration (e.g., via a malicious workspace settings file or a compromised extension).
- The extension must be actively invoking commands that substitute `{code}` and execute them via `cp.exec`.

### Source Code Analysis
1. **Configuration Retrieval:**
   In `helpers.ts`, the command template is obtained:
   ```js
   let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace
       .getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense")
       .get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
   ```
2. **Code Escaping & Substitution:**
   The generated PHP code is minimally escaped:
   ```js
   code = code.replace(/\"/g, "\\\"");
   // On Unix-like platforms, additional replacements (e.g., for `$`) are applied.
   let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);
   ```
3. **Command Execution:**
   The final command is executed using:
   ```js
   cp.exec(command, { cwd: <project_folder> }, (err, stdout, stderr) => { … });
   ```
4. **Visualization:**
   - **Step 1:** Attacker sets
     `maliciousTemplate = "php -r \"{code}; system('echo Vulnerable');\""`
   - **Step 2:** Substitution yields
     `finalCommand = "php -r \"<dynamic PHP code>; system('echo Vulnerable');\""`
   - **Step 3:** `finalCommand` is executed by `cp.exec`, running the injected command.

### Security Test Case
1. **Preparation:**
   - In a controlled VS Code workspace, modify (or create) the settings file to include:
     ```json
     {
       "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}; system('echo Vulnerable');\""
     }
     ```
2. **Triggering the Vulnerability:**
   - Open a Laravel project with the extension enabled.
   - Initiate an action (such as triggering autocompletion) that causes the helper function to execute.
3. **Observation:**
   - Monitor the output channel or terminal for the string “Vulnerable”.
4. **Validation:**
   - The appearance of “Vulnerable” confirms that the injected command executed.
5. **Cleanup:**
   - Restore the original configuration.

## 2. Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Laravel Project Files

### Description
The extension automatically scans Laravel projects to fetch routes, configurations, views, and additional metadata by executing PHP code. To do so, it bootstraps the Laravel application by loading core files such as the vendor autoloader and bootstrap file (e.g., `bootstrap/app.php`). If an attacker is able to modify any of these project files (for example, by injecting malicious code into a service provider or altering the bootstrap process), the extension will inadvertently execute the injected PHP code during its routine operations.

### Step-by-Step Trigger
1. **Write Access to Project Files:**
   The attacker gains the ability to modify Laravel project files—possibly through a compromised dependency or by directly writing to the project.
2. **Injection of Malicious Code:**
   The attacker injects a PHP payload into a file guaranteed to load during bootstrapping (for instance, modifying a service provider or `bootstrap/app.php` by inserting code that writes a marker file).
3. **Extension Bootstrapping:**
   Upon opening the Laravel project in VS Code, the extension automatically invokes `Helpers.runLaravel()`, which constructs a PHP command that includes the autoloader and bootstrap file.
4. **Execution of Malicious Code:**
   As the Laravel application boots, any malicious PHP code present in the compromised file is executed.
5. **Arbitrary Code Execution:**
   The attacker’s payload runs under the PHP process with the privileges of the developer, potentially leading to further exploitation (e.g., opening a reverse shell or modifying files).

### Impact
- **Arbitrary PHP Code Execution:** The injected PHP code can perform any action permitted by PHP, including executing system commands.
- **Complete Environment Compromise:** The malicious payload might exfiltrate data, install persistence mechanisms, modify critical project files, or otherwise compromise the development environment.
- **Loss of Trust in Project Integrity:** Since the extension bootstraps the Laravel project without any integrity checks, even inadvertent modifications can lead to significant security risks.

### Vulnerability Rank
**Critical**

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- **Security Warning Documentation:**
  The extension’s README and security note warn developers about automatic execution of Laravel projects and advise disabling the extension when working on sensitive files.
- **Configurable PHP Command:**
  The PHP command executed is configurable, theoretically allowing a user to adjust it. However, this is advisory rather than a robust technical mitigation.

### Missing Mitigations
- **Sandboxing or Isolation:**
  There is no technical isolation or sandboxing of the PHP execution environment.
- **Integrity or Cryptographic Checks:**
  No verification of the Laravel core or project files is performed before execution.
- **Runtime Monitoring:**
  The extension does not monitor or restrict the execution context to detect malicious payloads embedded in project files.

### Preconditions
- The attacker must be capable of modifying Laravel project files (such as service providers or bootstrap files).
- The extension must perform its autocompletion or metadata extraction by bootstrapping the Laravel application via the `Helpers.runLaravel()` function.

### Source Code Analysis
1. **File Inclusion for Bootstrapping:**
   In `Helpers.runLaravel()` (located in *helpers.ts*), the function first verifies the presence of `vendor/autoload.php` and `bootstrap/app.php`.
2. **Command Construction:**
   The PHP command is constructed by concatenating:
   - A requirement for the vendor autoloader.
   - A load call for the bootstrap file.
   - Insertion of dynamically generated PHP code to output autocompletion data.
   Example snippet:
   ```js
   let command = `php -r "require 'vendor/autoload.php'; require 'bootstrap/app.php'; ${code}"`;
   ```
3. **Execution:**
   The constructed command is passed to Node’s `cp.exec`, which runs the PHP code in the context of the full Laravel application.
4. **Vulnerability Mechanism:**
   Any injected malicious code in the bootstrap process (for example, within a service provider) is executed without isolation.
5. **Visualization:**
   - **Step 1:** Malicious payload is embedded in, say, `bootstrap/app.php`.
   - **Step 2:** The helper function constructs the command to include this file.
   - **Step 3:** When executed, the payload runs, proving arbitrary code execution is possible.

### Security Test Case
1. **Test Environment Setup:**
   - Create or use a test Laravel project in a controlled environment.
   - Install the Laravel Extra Intellisense extension.
2. **Attack Simulation:**
   - Modify a Laravel project file (for example, a service provider or `bootstrap/app.php`) to add benign “malicious” code (e.g., PHP code that writes a uniquely named file such as `vulnerable.txt` into the project directory).
3. **Trigger the Vulnerability:**
   - Open the project in VS Code and perform an action (such as editing a PHP file) that forces the extension to invoke `Helpers.runLaravel()`.
4. **Observation:**
   - Check the filesystem for the artifact (e.g., `vulnerable.txt`) or review the extension output for signs of payload execution.
5. **Validation:**
   - The creation of the expected marker file confirms that the injected code was executed.
6. **Cleanup:**
   - Remove the injected malicious code and restore the original project files.

*Note:* Both vulnerabilities result from insufficient validation and unsafe execution practices. Strengthening input sanitization and adopting safer process execution techniques are essential to mitigate these issues.
