- **Vulnerability Name**: Path Traversal in `/evals` Endpoints
  **Description**: The endpoints for handling evaluations (e.g., `/evals` and `/pairwise-evals`) accept folder paths as query parameters without proper validation. Attackers can manipulate these parameters to traverse directories and access sensitive files outside the intended scope.
  **Impact**: Unauthorized access to system files or sensitive data stored on the server.
  **Vulnerability Rank**: High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. The code checks if the folder exists but doesn't restrict paths to a safe directory.
  **Missing Mitigations**: Sanitize input paths (e.g., using `os.path.realpath` to resolve paths and ensure they reside within a designated directory).
  **Preconditions**: An attacker can control the `folder` query parameters in the `/evals` or `/pairwise-evals` requests.
  **Source Code Analysis**:
  - In `backend/routes/evals.py`, the `get_evals` and `get_pairwise_evals` functions use unsanitized folder paths directly from query parameters.
  - Example vulnerable code: `folder = request.query_params.get("folder")` followed by `os.path.exists(folder)` without path validation.
  **Security Test Case**:
  1. Deploy the backend with access to sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
  2. Send a request to `/evals?folder=../../../etc` to retrieve `/etc/passwd`.
  3. Observe the response contains the contents of `/etc/passwd`, confirming path traversal.

- **Vulnerability Name**: API Key Exposure in Error Responses
  **Description**: The `/api/screenshot` endpoint passes the user-provided API key as a query parameter to an external service. If an error occurs (e.g., invalid key), the error message may include the URL with the API key, exposing it to attackers.
  **Impact**: Exposure of sensitive API keys, leading to unauthorized access to the external service (e.g., ScreenshotOne).
  **Vulnerability Rank**: High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. Error messages may include the full URL with the API key.
  **Missing Mitigations**: Redact sensitive parameters from error messages and use POST requests with API keys in the body instead of query parameters.
  **Preconditions**: The endpoint receives an invalid API key or encounters an error when invoking the external service.
  **Source Code Analysis**:
  - In `backend/routes/screenshot.py`, the API key is passed as `access_key` in the query parameters of the request to `api.screenshotone.com`.
  - Error handling in `capture_screenshot` may expose the URL (containing the key) in exception messages.
  **Security Test Case**:
  1. Send a request to `/api/screenshot` with an invalid API key.
  2. Check the error response or logs for the URL containing the API key (e.g., `https://api.screenshotone.com?access_key=...`).
  3. Observe the API key is exposed, confirming the vulnerability.

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Insecure CORS Configuration** was excluded because it is caused by developers explicitly using an insecure code pattern (`allow_origins=["*"]` in `backend/main.py`). This matches the exclusion criteria.
- **Path Traversal** and **API Key Exposure** remain as they are valid (not already mitigated), rank "High," and do not involve DoS or documentation-only fixes.
