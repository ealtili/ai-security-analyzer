### Vulnerability: Improper Validation of `deno.path` Leading to Command Injection
**Description**:
The extension allows users to configure the Deno executable path via the `deno.path` setting. The `getDenoCommandPath()` function in `client/src/util.ts` resolves this path relative to workspace folders without validating that the resolved path points to a legitimate Deno executable. An attacker could set `deno.path` to a malicious executable path (e.g., `../../../../malicious/deno`), leading the extension to execute it when starting the Deno Language Server or running tasks. The existence check (`fileExists()`) only verifies the file exists but not its integrity.

**Impact**: Execution of arbitrary commands with the permissions of the user running VS Code, potentially leading to system compromise.

**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
- The path is resolved relative to workspace folders.
- Existence check (`fileExists()`) ensures the file exists before using it.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- No validation that the resolved path points to a trusted Deno executable (e.g., checking binary signature or path within trusted directories).
- No prevention against path traversal attacks when resolving relative paths.

**Preconditions**:
- The attacker has write access to the workspace's settings (`settings.json`) to set `deno.path`.
- The malicious Deno executable exists at the specified path.

**Source Code Analysis**:
1. In `client/src/util.ts`, `getDenoCommandPath()` constructs paths using `path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command)`, where `command` is from user settings.
2. The resolved path is validated only for existence via `fileExists()`, not for legitimacy as a Deno executable.
3. The resolved path is used directly in `serverOptions.run.command` when starting the Deno Language Server in `client/src/commands.ts:startLanguageServer()`.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Create a malicious executable (e.g., `malicious_deno.sh` with `#!/bin/sh; /bin/sh -i`) and grant execute permissions.
2. Set `deno.path` to the malicious executable's path in VS Code settings.
3. Trigger the extension to start the Deno Language Server (e.g., open a Deno project).
4. The malicious executable executes, allowing command injection.

### Vulnerability: Command Injection via User-Provided Task Definitions
**Description**:
Tasks defined in `tasks.json` can include command arguments that are directly passed to the Deno CLI without validation. The `buildDenoTask()` function in `client/src/tasks.ts` concatenates `definition.command` and `definition.args` into the command line, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary commands. For example, setting `args` to `["; rm -rf /"]` would execute the deletion command when the task runs.

**Impact**: Execution of arbitrary commands with elevated permissions if Deno is allowed system access via flags like `--allow-all`.

**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- No input sanitization of command arguments from user-supplied task definitions.
- No validation of task definitions against a safe command whitelist.

**Preconditions**:
- The attacker can modify or create a malicious `tasks.json` file in the workspace.

**Source Code Analysis**:
1. In `client/src/tasks.ts`, `buildDenoTask()` constructs the command as `[definition.command].concat(definition.args ?? [])`.
2. User-provided `args` are directly appended to the command without escaping or validation.
3. Tasks are executed via `vscode.tasks.executeTask()` without checking for malicious arguments.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Add a task definition in `tasks.json` with `args` like `["--allow-run", "&& rm -rf /"]`.
2. Run the task using the VS Code Tasks panel.
3. The malicious command executes, deleting files if permissions are granted.

### Vulnerability: Environment Variable Injection via `deno.env` and `deno.envFile`
**Description**:
The extension reads environment variables from `deno.env` and `deno.envFile` settings and passes them to the Deno process. An attacker can set environment variables like `DENO_DIR` to a malicious path or inject shell metacharacters into variables, leading to arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation.

**Impact**: Execution of arbitrary code or escalation of privileges via manipulated environment variables.

**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
- No mitigation; variables are directly used as configured.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- No validation of variables or their values.
- No restriction on variables like `DENO_DIR` to prevent path traversal.

**Preconditions**:
- The attacker can modify VS Code settings to set malicious `deno.env` or `deno.envFile`.

**Source Code Analysis**:
1. In `client/src/commands.ts:startLanguageServer()`, `env` is populated from `config.get<Record<string, string>>("env")` and `denoEnvFile`.
2. Environment variables are passed directly to the Deno process without validation.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Set `deno.env` to include `DENO_DIR=/tmp/evil_cache; rm -rf /`.
2. Start the Deno Language Server; the shell command executes due to unescaped variables.

### Vulnerability: Command Injection in Test Arguments
**Description**:
The `test` command in `client/src/commands.ts` uses `deno.codeLens.testArgs` to construct command-line arguments. If an attacker sets these arguments to include malicious content (e.g., `["--allow-all", "--", "&& echo 'hacked' > /tmp/exploit"]`), the Deno CLI will execute the injected command.

**Impact**: Execution of arbitrary commands with permissions granted by the test context.

**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
- Default arguments are `["--allow-all"]`, but user-provided args are unsanitized.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- No validation or escaping of user-provided test arguments.

**Preconditions**:
- The attacker can control `deno.codeLens.testArgs` in workspace settings.

**Source Code Analysis**:
1. In `client/src/commands.ts:test()`, `testArgs` are taken directly from `config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs")`.
2. Malicious arguments are appended to `["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", ...]`, leading to command execution.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Set `deno.codeLens.testArgs` to `["--allow-run", "--", "&& touch /tmp/exploit"]`.
2. Run a test; the `touch` command executes, creating the file.
