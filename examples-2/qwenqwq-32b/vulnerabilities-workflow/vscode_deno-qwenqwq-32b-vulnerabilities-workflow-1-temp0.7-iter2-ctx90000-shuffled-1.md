### Updated List of Vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Deno Task Definitions
**Description:**
An attacker can create a malicious Deno task configuration in the project's `deno.json` or `tasks.json` file, specifying a task with malicious command-line arguments. The extension executes these commands without proper sanitization, leading to command injection. Specifically, an attacker can define a task with shell metacharacters (e.g., `; rm -rf /`), which execute unintended commands.

**Impact:**
Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process, leading to full system compromise, data theft, or disruption.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None.

**Missing Mitigations:**
User-provided task commands and arguments must be sanitized to block shell metacharacters. Input validation should restrict commands to safe parameters.

**Preconditions:**
- The victim must have the extension installed and enabled.
- The attacker must control the project's configuration files (`deno.json` or `tasks.json`).

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `tasks.ts`, `buildDenoTask` constructs commands using user-provided `definition.command` and `args`:
   ```typescript
   const args = [definition.command].concat(definition.args ?? []);
   return buildDenoTask(workspaceFolder, process, definition, command, args, ...)
   ```
   Here, `definition.command` and `args` come from user-controlled JSON configurations.

2. `util.ts` parses task definitions without sanitization:
   ```typescript
   const taskValue = taskProperty.children?.[1];
   command = taskValue.value; // Directly uses user-provided string
   ```

3. The command is executed via `ProcessExecution`:
   ```typescript
   new vscode.ProcessExecution(process, ["task", ...args])
   ```
   This passes unsanitized arguments directly to the shell, enabling injection.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Create a malicious `deno.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "tasks": {
       "malicious": "run --allow-run '; echo EXPLOIT > /tmp/exploit.txt'"
     }
   }
   ```
2. Open the project in VSCode with the extension enabled.
3. Run the "malicious" task via the task interface.
4. Verify `/tmp/exploit.txt` exists, confirming command execution.

#### Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Command Execution via `deno.path` Configuration
**Description:**
The `deno.path` configuration allows specifying the Deno executable path. An attacker can set this to a malicious binary, leading the extension to execute arbitrary code. The extension resolves the path without verifying its integrity, allowing execution of a user-specified executable.

**Impact:**
Attackers can execute arbitrary code by pointing `deno.path` to a malicious binary, leading to full system compromise.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None.

**Missing Mitigations:**
The Deno executable path must be validated (e.g., checksum verification) or restricted to trusted locations.

**Preconditions:**
- The victim must configure `deno.path` to a malicious binary location.
- The attacker must have write access to the configured path (if it's within the workspace).

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `util.ts`, `getDenoCommandPath` resolves paths without validation:
   ```typescript
   if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
     for (const workspace of workspaceFolders) {
       const commandPath = path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command);
       if (await fileExists(commandPath)) {
         return commandPath; // Returns attacker-controlled path
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   This allows execution of any executable within a workspace folder.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Create a malicious `deno` executable with a payload (e.g., writes to `/tmp/exploit`).
2. Place it in a workspace directory (e.g., `./malicious/deno`).
3. Set `deno.path` in VSCode settings to `"./malicious/deno"`.
4. Trigger a Deno command via the extension (e.g., debugging).
5. Verify the malicious payload executes (e.g., `/tmp/exploit` exists).
