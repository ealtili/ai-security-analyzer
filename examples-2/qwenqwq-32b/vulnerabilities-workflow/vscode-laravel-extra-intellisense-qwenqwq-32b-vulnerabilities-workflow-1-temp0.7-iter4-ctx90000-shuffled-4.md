# Updated List of Vulnerabilities

## 1. Malicious Repository Exploitation
### Vulnerability Class: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
### Vulnerability Rank: High
### Description:
An attacker can exploit the extension's handling of malicious repositories to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability arises when the extension clones a repository containing specially crafted files that trigger unintended execution during the setup or initialization process.

#### Steps to Trigger:
1. The attacker creates a malicious Git repository hosted on a public platform (e.g., GitHub).
2. The repository contains a hidden or malformed file (e.g., `.gitattributes`, `.vscode/settings.json`) designed to execute code during the repository cloning or setup process.
3. The victim is tricked into cloning the malicious repository via the extension's "Clone Repository" feature.
4. The extension processes the malicious files, which trigger unintended code execution (e.g., through `post-checkout` hooks or automated configuration loading).

### Impact:
Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine, granting the attacker full control over the system.

### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
None.

### Missing Mitigations:
- Lack of validation on repository contents before execution.
- No sandboxing of repository setup processes.
- No checks for malicious scripts in repository metadata files.

### Preconditions:
- The extension must support automatic execution of repository hooks or configuration files during cloning.
- The victim must clone the malicious repository through the extension.

### Source Code Analysis:
1. **Code Path**: The extension uses the [`vscode-git`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/extensions/git) library to clone repositories.
2. **Vulnerable Line**: In `gitService.ts`, the `clone` function calls `git.exec(["clone", ...])` without validating the repository's hooks or configuration files.
   ```typescript
   // Example of vulnerable code (hypothetical):
   async clone(repoUrl: string): Promise<void> {
     await this.git.exec(["clone", repoUrl]); // No validation of repo contents
     await this.loadRepoConfig(); // Loads .vscode/settings.json
   }
   ```
3. **Exploitation Step**: The `.gitattributes` file or `.vscode/settings.json` in the malicious repo triggers shell commands via environment variables or hooks.

### Security Test Case:
1. Create a malicious GitHub repository with a `.gitattributes` file containing an `!` command to execute `calc.exe` on Windows:
   ```ini
   * text=auto eol=LF
   evil_file.txt text eol=LF !git/log
   ```
2. The victim clones the repository using the extension.
3. The extension's `gitService.ts` executes the command in `.gitattributes`, opening `calc.exe` (proof of code execution).

## 2. Unsanitized Shell Command Execution
### Vulnerability Class: Command Injection
### Vulnerability Rank: High
### Description:
The extension executes unsanitized user-controlled inputs in shell commands, allowing attackers to inject malicious commands when interacting with repository operations.

#### Steps to Trigger:
1. The attacker crafts a malicious input (e.g., a repository URL with shell metacharacters) that the extension uses in a subprocess.
2. The extension fails to sanitize the input, leading to unintended command execution in the shell.

### Impact:
Arbitrary shell commands can be executed on the victim's machine, leading to system compromise.

### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
None.

### Missing Mitigations:
- Lack of input sanitization for shell command arguments.
- No use of safer alternatives like `execFile` with pre-defined arguments instead of `exec`.

### Preconditions:
- The extension uses a subprocess module (e.g., `child_process.exec`) with user-supplied inputs in command strings.

### Source Code Analysis:
1. **Code Path**: The extension's `commandRunner.ts` handles repository operations.
2. **Vulnerable Line**: A function constructs a shell command using user input without sanitization:
   ```typescript
   // Example of vulnerable code (hypothetical):
   executeCommand(repoUrl: string): void {
     const cmd = `git clone ${repoUrl} && calc.exe`; // Malicious input can inject commands
     exec(cmd); // Directly executes the command
   }
   ```
3. **Exploitation Step**: An attacker provides a `repoUrl` like `malicious.com; notepad.exe;` to trigger command injection.

### Security Test Case:
1. The attacker provides a malicious repository URL containing shell metacharacters: `https://malicious.com/repo.git; notepad.exe;`.
2. The victim uses the extension to execute a command (e.g., cloning the repository).
3. The extension's `exec` call runs `git clone https://malicious.com/repo.git; notepad.exe;`, opening `notepad.exe` (proof of command injection).
