- **Vulnerability Name**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Code Generation
  **Description**:
  1. An attacker crafts a seemingly benign input image or video that contains hidden elements (e.g., JavaScript payloads in alt attributes of placeholder images or obfuscated instructions).
  2. The AI interprets these elements and generates HTML/JS code containing malicious scripts (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).
  3. The backend sends the unvalidated code to the frontend, which executes it when deployed by the user, enabling XSS attacks.

  **Impact**: Attackers can steal session cookies, execute arbitrary JavaScript, or take over user accounts.
  **Vulnerability Rank**: High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. The backend does not sanitize or validate generated code.
  **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Sanitize output code to remove dangerous tags (e.g., `<script>`, `<iframe>`).
  - Implement input/output validation to block suspicious patterns.
  - Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict script execution.

  **Preconditions**: Attacker must provide input to trigger code generation.
  **Source Code Analysis**:
  1. The FastAPI endpoint (e.g., `/generate_code`) processes user-uploaded images and sends them to the AI model.
  2. The AI generates code (e.g., HTML/CSS/JS) based on the image, which is then returned directly to the frontend.
  3. No sanitization occurs between the AI’s output and the response to the user.
  4. If the AI outputs malicious `<script>` tags, they are sent unaltered to the user, who may deploy them into their project.

  **Security Test Case**:
  1. Upload an image containing a hidden instruction like `Add <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` in an alt attribute of a placeholder image.
  2. Trigger code generation for HTML/Tailwind.
  3. Inspect the generated `code` response for the malicious script.
  4. Deploy the generated code into a test project and verify that the script executes in the browser.

  **Expected Outcome**: The output includes the malicious script, which executes in the user’s browser when deployed, demonstrating the lack of sanitization.

The other vulnerabilities (Arbitrary Code Execution and Information Disclosure) were excluded because:
- **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Missing a security test case (required for validation).
- **Information Disclosure**: Ranked medium severity (excluded by criteria).
