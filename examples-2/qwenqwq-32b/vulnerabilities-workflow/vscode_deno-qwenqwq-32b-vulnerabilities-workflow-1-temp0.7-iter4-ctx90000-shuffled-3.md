# Vulnerability List for Deno VSCode Extension

## Vulnerability 1: Command Injection via Deno Task Definitions
**Description**: The extension executes Deno tasks defined in user-configurable `tasks.json` files without proper validation of the command or arguments. An attacker can create a malicious task definition with crafted commands or arguments, leading to arbitrary command execution. The `buildDenoTask` function in `tasks.ts` constructs commands directly from user-provided values, which can include malicious payloads. For example, setting the `command` field to `bash -c 'malicious command'` or injecting shell metacharacters in `args` bypasses input sanitization.

**Step-by-Step Exploitation**:
1. The attacker provides a malicious repository with a `tasks.json` file containing a task with a malicious command (e.g., `command": "rm -rf /"`, `args: ["; echo Exploited > /tmp/exploit"]`).
2. When the user runs the malicious task via the VSCode task runner, the extension executes the command verbatim via `ProcessExecution`, leading to RCE.

**Impact**: Threat actors can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine, compromising system integrity.

**Risk Rank**: Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. The code directly uses user-provided strings without validation.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- Input validation/escaping for command fields and arguments.
- Restrict allowed commands to Deno-specific operations.
- Sanitize inputs to prevent shell metacharacters.

**Preconditions**:
- User opens a malicious workspace with a crafted `tasks.json` defining a malicious task.
- The task is executed via VSCode's task runner.

**Source Code Analysis**:
- In `tasks.ts`, the `buildDenoTask` function constructs commands from `definition.command` and `definition.args` without validation:
  ```typescript
  args = [definition.command].concat(definition.args ?? []);
  // ...
  new ProcessExecution(process, ["task", ...args])
  ```
- User-defined task definitions in `tasks.json` are parsed without input validation, allowing arbitrary command strings.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Create a malicious workspace with a `tasks.json` containing:
   ```json
   {
     "tasks": [
       {
         "type": "deno",
         "command": "bash",
         "args": ["-c", "echo Vulnerable > /tmp/exploit && id"],
         "label": "Exploit Task"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
2. Open the workspace in VSCode and run the "Exploit Task".
3. Check if `/tmp/exploit` is created and the command output confirms RCE.

## Vulnerability 2: Code Injection via Test Configuration Arguments
**Description**: The test execution functionality in `commands.ts` constructs Deno test commands using user-configured test arguments (`testArgs`). These arguments can be manipulated via `deno.codeLens.testArgs` settings, allowing injection of malicious CLI arguments that execute arbitrary code. For example, injecting `--allow-run --command="maliciousScript"` could execute arbitrary Deno scripts.

**Step-by-Step Exploitation**:
1. The attacker sets the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` configuration to include `--allow-run` and a crafted script path (e.g., `--run="malicious.ts"`).
2. When the user runs a test via the "Run Test" code lens, the malicious script executes with elevated permissions.

**Impact**: Malicious Deno scripts could access system resources or execute arbitrary code.

**Risk Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. Test arguments are directly included in command-line execution.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- Validation of test arguments to block unsafe flags like `--allow-run`.
- Restrict CLI arguments to those required for testing.

**Preconditions**:
- User has configured test arguments with malicious values.
- The user triggers a test execution via the test code lens.

**Source Code Analysis**:
- In `commands.ts`, test command construction includes user-configured `testArgs`:
  ```typescript
  const testArgs: string[] = [
    ...(config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs") ?? []),
  ];
  // ...
  const task = buildDenoConfigTask(..., ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", ...]);
  ```
- Malicious `testArgs` can introduce unsafe Deno CLI flags.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Set VSCode settings:
   ```json
   {
     "deno.codeLens.testArgs": ["--allow-run", "--", "bash -c 'echo Exploited > /tmp/exploit'"]
   }
   ```
2. Create a dummy test file and run the test via the code lens.
3. Verify `/tmp/exploit` is created.

**Conclusion**: The critical vulnerability in task execution (`Vulnerability 1`) and the high-severity code injection via test arguments (`Vulnerability 2`) are the most pressing risks. Both require strict validation and sanitization of user-provided inputs to prevent untrusted command-line argument manipulation. Addressing these issues ensures the extension cannot execute arbitrary code from malicious repositories or configurations.

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Excluded Vulnerability 3**: Path Traversal via Import Map Configuration was removed because it does not fall into the required vulnerability classes (RCE/Command/Code Injection).
2. **Retained Vulnerabilities 1 and 2**:
   - **Vulnerability 1** is Critical for RCE, fully aligns with the criteria, and has no mitigations.
   - **Vulnerability 2** is High for Code Injection, with no mitigations and valid exploitation.
3. **Updated Conclusion**: Adjusted to focus on remaining vulnerabilities and their impact.

### Key Validation:
- **Vulnerability Classes**: Only RCE (Command Injection) and Code Injection are included.
- **Risk Rank**: Only Critical and High are retained.
- **Mitigations Check**: Both vulnerabilities explicitly state "Currently Implemented Mitigations: None".
- **Exclusion Reasons**: Vulnerability 3 was path traversal (not allowed) and the others had no excluded conditions.
