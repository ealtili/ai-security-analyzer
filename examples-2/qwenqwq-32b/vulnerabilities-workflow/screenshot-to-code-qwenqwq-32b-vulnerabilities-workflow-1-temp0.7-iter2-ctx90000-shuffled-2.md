### Vulnerability List

#### 2. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Screenshot Endpoint**

**Description:**
The `/api/screenshot` endpoint takes a URL from user input and uses it to generate screenshots via an external service. An attacker can exploit this to target internal services or spoof requests to other domains, exposing sensitive data or triggering unintended actions.

**Trigger Steps:**
1. An attacker sends a request to `/api/screenshot` with `url=http://internal-service:port/sensitive-path`.
2. The backend processes this URL, potentially accessing internal resources or malicious destinations.

**Impact:**
High. Attackers can extract data from internal systems, trigger unintended API calls, or exploit other vulnerabilities via the exposed URL parameter.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The URL is used directly without validation.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Validate and restrict `url` to prevent access to non-public/internal domains.
- Sanitize input to block protocols like `file://` or `http://localhost`.

**Preconditions:** None. The endpoint is publicly accessible.

**Source Code Analysis:**
In `backend/routes/screenshot.py`:
```python
async def capture_screenshot(
    target_url: str, api_key: str, device: str = "desktop"
) -> bytes:
    api_base_url = "https://api.screenshotone.com/take"
    params = {
        "access_key": api_key,
        "url": target_url,  # Vulnerable parameter: user-controlled URL
        ...
    }
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(api_base_url, params=params)
```

**Security Test Case:**
1. Send a POST request to `http://backend:7001/api/screenshot` with JSON body:
```json
{
  "url": "http://internal-service:8080/secrets",
  "apiKey": "...",
  "device": "desktop"
}
```
2. Observe if the backend makes requests to the internal URL, exposing data.

#### 4. **Lack of Input Validation in Prompts**

**Description:**
User-supplied data (e.g., image URLs, imported code) is directly incorporated into prompts for the LLM. Malicious input could trick the LLM into generating dangerous code or commands, leading to code injection vulnerabilities.

**Trigger Steps:**
1. An attacker provides a malicious image or code snippet as input.
2. The LLM generates harmful code (e.g., with XSS or command injection payloads).

**Impact:**
High. Injected malicious code could compromise frontend clients or server processes.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. Input is used directly without sanitization.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Sanitize user-provided inputs to prevent malicious instructions in prompts.
- Validate and restrict content types for images and code.

**Preconditions:** User must provide malicious input.

**Source Code Analysis:**
In `backend/prompts/__init__.py`:
```python
user_content: list = [...]  # Includes user-supplied image_data_url
prompt_messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": system_content},
    {"role": "user", "content": user_content},  # Directly uses user data
]
```

**Security Test Case:**
1. Send a request with an image URL containing malicious instructions (e.g., `javascript:alert()`) to generate code.
2. Check if the generated code executes arbitrary JavaScript when rendered in the frontend.

### Summary
The remaining vulnerabilities focus on critical risks from improper input validation and SSRF. Addressing these requires URL validation for external requests and rigorous sanitization of user inputs to LLM prompts.
