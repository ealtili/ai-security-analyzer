### **1. Command Injection via Test Arguments Configuration**
**Vulnerability Name**: Command Injection via Test Arguments Configuration
**Description**:
The extension allows users to configure test arguments through the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting. These arguments are directly appended to the command line when executing Deno tests. An attacker could inject malicious shell commands (e.g., `--arg; rm -rf /` or `--arg && <malicious-command>`) into the configuration, leading to arbitrary command execution.

**Steps to Trigger**:
1. An attacker crafts a malicious `deno.json` or `settings.json` file with `deno.codeLens.testArgs` set to include a command (e.g., `["--allow-run", "--", "echo hacked > /tmp/exploit"]`).
2. The victim opens the malicious workspace in VS Code and runs a Deno test using the extension's command (e.g., `Deno: Test`).
3. The malicious command in `testArgs` is executed by the Deno CLI, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact**:
Attackers can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the VS Code process, potentially leading to full system compromise.
**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical
**Current Mitigations**:
- None detected. The code directly appends user-provided arguments to the command line without sanitization.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Input validation/sanitization for `deno.codeLens.testArgs` to prevent shell metacharacters.
- Escaping special characters in command-line arguments.
**Preconditions**:
- The extension must be enabled (`deno.enable` is true).
- The attacker must control the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting in workspace/user settings.

**Source Code Analysis**:
- **File**: `client/src/commands.ts`
  ```typescript
  const config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS, uri);
  const testArgs: string[] = [
    ...(config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs") ?? []),
  ];
  // ...
  const args = ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", nameRegex, filePath];
  ```
- **File**: `client/src/tasks.ts`
  The `args` array is passed directly to the Deno CLI, allowing injection.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Create a malicious `settings.json` with:
```json
{
  "deno.codeLens.testArgs": ["--allow-run", "--", "echo 'VULNERABLE' > /tmp/exploit"]
}
```
2. Run a test via `Deno: Test` command.
3. Check `/tmp/exploit` for the injected text.

### **2. Arbitrary Command Execution via Task Definitions**
**Vulnerability Name**: Arbitrary Command Execution via Task Definitions
**Description**:
The extension executes Deno tasks from user-defined task configurations (e.g., `deno.json`). Attackers can inject malicious commands into the `command` or `args` fields of task definitions, leading to arbitrary command execution when the task is run.

**Steps to Trigger**:
1. An attacker creates a `deno.json` with a malicious task definition:
```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "malicious-task": {
      "command": "sh -c 'echo hacked > /tmp/exploit'"
    }
  }
}
```
2. The victim runs the task via the VS Code Tasks panel or command palette (e.g., `Run Task: malicious-task`).
3. The malicious command is executed by the Deno CLI, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact**:
Attackers can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the VS Code process.
**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical
**Current Mitigations**:
- None. The task definitions are parsed and executed verbatim.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Validation to block dangerous commands or arguments in task configurations.
**Preconditions**:
- The attacker must control the workspace's `deno.json` or task configuration files.

**Source Code Analysis**:
- **File**: `client/src/tasks_sidebar.ts` (task parsing) and `client/src/tasks.ts` (task execution):
  The `buildDenoConfigTask` function constructs commands from user-provided `command` and `args` fields without sanitization.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Create a `deno.json` with a malicious task:
```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "test-task": {
      "command": "echo 'VULNERABLE' > /tmp/exploit"
    }
  }
}
```
2. Run the task via the VS Code Tasks panel.
3. Check `/tmp/exploit` for the injected text.

### **Summary**
The retained vulnerabilities are critical and involve **Command Injection**, which falls under the RCE category. The third vulnerability (Path Traversal) was excluded because it does not directly align with the specified vulnerability classes (RCE, Command Injection, Code Injection). Immediate fixes include input sanitization and validation of user-provided configurations.
