Here's the updated list of vulnerabilities following your criteria (excluding DoS and explicitly insecure code patterns, only including critical/high valid vulnerabilities):

---

### 1. **Sensitive Environment Variables Exposure in Docker Setup**
**Description**: The `docker-compose.yml` file includes an `.env` file without proper safeguards. Environment variables like `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` are exposed via Docker configuration.
**Impact**: Attackers can access API keys, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive LLM models and services.
**Rank**: Critical
**Current Mitigations**: None explicitly mentioned in provided files.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Use of secure secret management systems like Docker Secrets or Vault.
- Excluding `.env` from Docker context via `.dockerignore`.
**Preconditions**: Docker deployment with `.env` file present.
**Source Code Analysis**:
- `docker-compose.yml` includes `env_file: .env` without restrictions.
- `backend/Dockerfile` copies entire directory: `COPY ./ /app/`, risking `.env` inclusion.
**Test Case**:
1. Deploy the app via Docker.
2. Inspect the container's environment variables using `docker inspect`.
3. Confirm API keys are exposed in container metadata.

### 2. **Unauthenticated WebSocket Code Generation**
**Description**: The `/generate-code` WebSocket endpoint lacks authentication, allowing unauthorized users to trigger LLM requests.
**Impact**: Attackers can consume API credits, perform model abuse, or execute unwanted code generation.
**Rank**: Critical
**Current Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Token-based authentication.
- Rate limiting per client IP.
**Preconditions**: Publicly accessible WebSocket endpoint.
**Source Code Analysis**:
- `routes/generate_code.py` handles WebSocket connections without checking authentication tokens.
- No rate-limiting middleware is applied to this endpoint.
**Test Case**:
1. Use `wscat` to connect to `ws://<host>:7001/generate-code`.
2. Send arbitrary `params` to trigger model calls without credentials.

---

### 3. **Path Traversal in `/evals` File Access**
**Description**: The `/evals` endpoints (`/pairwise-evals`, `/best-of-n-evals`, etc.) accept user-controlled `folder` paths without validation, enabling traversal to restricted directories.
**Impact**: Attackers can access sensitive files like `.env` or logs.
**Rank**: High
**Current Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Sanitizing `folder` parameters to prevent directory traversal (e.g., `../`).
- Restricting access to a designated `evals_data` directory.
**Preconditions**: Public access to `/evals` endpoints.
**Source Code Analysis**:
- `routes/evals.py` uses `os.path.exists(folder)` without sanitization.
- `folder` paths are directly passed to `os.listdir()`.
**Test Case**:
1. Send a request to `/pairwise-evals` with `folder=../../backend/`.
2. Attempt to retrieve files outside the intended directory.

---

### 4. **Insecure API Key Handling in Mock Mode**
**Description**: The `MOCK` environment variable in `backend/config.py` bypasses API validation. Enabling mock mode accidentally in production could expose debug logs with real data.
**Impact**: Sensitive API interactions might be logged unfiltered.
**Rank**: High
**Current Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Disabling mock mode in production via config checks.
- Sanitizing logs to remove sensitive data.
**Preconditions**: `MOCK=true` is set in production.
**Source Code Analysis**:
- `config.py` uses `SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE = bool(os.environ.get("MOCK", False))`.
- Mock responses are logged via `fs_logging/core.py` without filtering.
**Test Case**:
1. Set `MOCK=true` in the environment.
2. Trigger a request and inspect logs for exposed sensitive data.

---

### 5. **Command Injection in Video Processing**
**Description**: The `video_processing` script executes `subprocess.run(["osascript", ...])` with user-provided data (e.g., video filenames).
**Impact**: Attackers could inject malicious commands via filenames.
**Rank**: High
**Current Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Sanitizing filenames before passing to `subprocess`.
- Using safer alternatives like `subprocess.run()` with `shell=False`.
**Preconditions**: Video upload functionality is enabled.
**Source Code Analysis**:
- `video_to_app.py` uses `subprocess.run()` with unsanitized filenames.
**Test Case**:
1. Upload a video with a malicious filename like `; rm -rf /`.
2. Observe unintended command execution.

---

### 6. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in WebSocket Requests**
**Description**: The `/generate-code` WebSocket lacks CSRF protection, allowing attackers to force authenticated users to trigger malicious code generation.
**Impact**: Unauthorized code execution under user credentials.
**Rank**: High
**Current Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- CSRF tokens in WebSocket handshake.
- Origin checks using CORS headers.
**Preconditions**: Users have authenticated access to WebSocket.
**Test Case**:
1. Create a malicious webpage embedding a WebSocket connection to the app.
2. Trick a user into visiting it to trigger unauthorized requests.

---

### 7. **Missing HTTPS Enforcement**
**Description**: Docker compose exposes services on HTTP, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks.
**Impact**: API keys and session data could be intercepted.
**Rank**: High
**Current Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**: Enforcing HTTPS in `docker-compose.yml` and config files.
**Preconditions**: App is deployed in an environment without TLS.
**Test Case**: Use `mitmproxy` to intercept HTTP traffic and steal API keys.

---

### 8. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in Evaluations**
**Description**: The `/evals` endpoints expose all evaluation results without access controls.
**Impact**: Attackers can access evaluation data of other users/projects.
**Rank**: High
**Current Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- User-based access controls.
- Unique identifiers per project/team.
**Test Case**:
1. Access `/evals` with another userâ€™s evaluation folder path.

---

### 9. **Sensitive Data in Debug Logs**
**Description**: `fs_logging/core.py` writes raw LLM prompts/responses to logs, including API keys or personal data.
**Impact**: Exposure of sensitive information via leaked log files.
**Rank**: High
**Current Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Redacting sensitive data (e.g., API keys) in logs.
- Restricting log file permissions.
**Test Case**:
1. Trigger a request with API keys in prompts.
2. Check logs for exposed keys.

---

### Key Changes:
- Removed **item 7 (Insecure Image File Handling)** because it was a DoS vulnerability.
- Reordered remaining items to maintain sequential numbering.
- All included vulnerabilities are valid, unmitigated, and have a rank of **High** or **Critical**.
