### 1. Improper Validation of Deno Executable Path Allows Arbitrary Code Execution

#### Description
The extension does not validate the executable path provided via the `deno.path` setting, allowing an attacker to point the extension to a malicious Deno binary. This can be triggered by:
1. An attacker setting the `deno.path` configuration to a path pointing to a malicious executable (e.g., `/path/to/malicious_deno`).
2. The extension uses this path when invoking Deno commands (e.g., during language server startup, task execution, or debugging).
3. The malicious binary is executed with the same privileges as VS Code, leading to arbitrary code execution.

#### Impact
An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the VS Code process, potentially compromising the user's system. This includes access to local files, network resources, and sensitive data.

#### Vulnerability Rank
Critical

#### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- None. The code does not validate the executable's authenticity or restrict paths to trusted locations.

#### Missing Mitigations
- **Executable validation**: The extension should verify the provided Deno binary is from a trusted source (e.g., checksum validation, path restrictions).
- **User warnings**: Alert users when `deno.path` points to non-standard or untrusted locations.
- **Path normalization**: Prevent path traversal attacks (e.g., `../../malicious/deno`).

#### Preconditions
- User/organization configuration must set `deno.path` to a malicious executable path.
- VS Code must be running with privileges allowing execution of the malicious binary.

#### Source Code Analysis
**File:** `client/src/util.ts`
**Function:** `getDenoCommandPath()`
```typescript
async function getDenoCommandPath() {
  const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
  if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
    // Resolves relative paths without validating authenticity
    for (const workspace of workspaceFolders) {
      const commandPath = path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command);
      if (await fileExists(commandPath)) {
        return commandPath;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Trigger Path**:
1. The attacker sets `deno.path` to a malicious path (e.g., `"./attack/deno.exe"`).
2. The extension resolves this path relative to the workspace directory.
3. The language server or CLI commands invoke the malicious executable via:
```typescript
// client/src/commands.ts
const command = await getDenoCommandPath();
// Starts language server using `command`, executing the malicious binary.
```

#### Security Test Case
1. **Setup**:
   - Install VS Code and the Deno extension.
   - Create a malicious script named `deno_malicious` with contents:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/sh
     echo "MALICIOUS EXECUTABLE TRIGGERED" > /tmp/exploit.txt
     ```
   - Make the script executable: `chmod +x deno_malicious`.

2. **Exploit**:
   - Open VS Code settings (`settings.json`) and set:
     ```json
     "deno.path": "/path/to/deno_malicious"
     ```
   - Restart VS Code or reload the window.

3. **Verification**:
   - Check if `/tmp/exploit.txt` was created.
   - The malicious script executes, confirming arbitrary code execution.
