### Updated Vulnerability List for Deno VSCode Extension

#### Vulnerability 1: Command Injection via Test Configuration Arguments
**Vulnerability Rank:** High
**Description:**
The extension allows users to configure test arguments (`deno.codeLens.testArgs`) in workspace settings. These arguments are directly passed to the Deno CLI command without validation or sanitization. An attacker can manipulate these arguments to inject malicious commands (e.g., `--allow-run; rm -rf /`).

**Steps to Trigger:**
1. The attacker provides a malicious workspace configuration file (e.g., `deno.json` or `settings.json`) containing crafted arguments in `deno.codeLens.testArgs`.
2. When the user runs a test via the "Run Test" code lens, the extension constructs the Deno command using these arguments. The injected commands execute in the shell.

**Impact:**
Execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the VS Code process, leading to remote code execution (RCE).

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- None identified. User-provided arguments are directly concatenated into the command line.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- Input validation/sanitization of `deno.codeLens.testArgs`.
- Restrict allowed parameters or use sandboxed execution for Deno CLI commands.
**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must have access to modify workspace settings or Deno configurations in the project.

#### Vulnerability 2: Command Injection via Task Configuration Arguments
**Vulnerability Rank:** High
**Description:**
The extension allows defining Deno tasks in `deno.json` files. When a task is executed, its arguments are passed directly to the Deno CLI without validation. An attacker can craft malicious task definitions in the workspace configuration to execute arbitrary commands.

**Steps to Trigger:**
1. The attacker includes a malicious task in `deno.json` with arguments like `["run", "--", "malicious.sh"]`.
2. The user runs the task via the tasks sidebar or command palette, resulting in execution of the malicious script.

**Impact:**
Arbitrary command execution in the context of the VS Code process.

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- None identified. Task arguments are trusted and directly executed.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- Validate task definitions to restrict allowed commands and parameters.
- Sandbox or escape arguments when invoking Deno CLI.
**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must have write access to the workspace's `deno.json` file.

#### Vulnerability 3: Debug Configuration Command Injection
**Vulnerability Rank:** High
**Description:**
The debug configuration provider constructs Deno CLI commands using user-provided `runtimeArgs` without validation. An attacker can manipulate debug configurations to inject malicious command-line arguments.

**Steps to Trigger:**
1. The attacker modifies debug settings (e.g., `launch.json`) to include malicious `runtimeArgs` (e.g., `["test", "--allow-run", "rm -rf /"]`).
2. Starting the debug session executes these arguments, leading to command execution.

**Impact:**
Arbitrary code execution via the debug configuration.

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- None identified. `runtimeArgs` are directly used in command construction.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- Validate and sanitize `runtimeArgs` to prevent shell metacharacter injection.
**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must have access to modify debug configuration files (`launch.json`).

#### Vulnerability 4: Insecure Deno CLI Path Execution
**Vulnerability Rank:** High
**Description:**
The extension allows users to configure the Deno CLI path via `deno.path`. If an attacker sets this path to a malicious executable, the extension will execute it without validation.

**Steps to Trigger:**
1. The attacker sets `deno.path` to a crafted malicious script (e.g., `C:\malicious_deno.exe`).
2. Any Deno command (e.g., formatting, testing) executed via the extension runs the malicious binary.

**Impact:**
Arbitrary code execution using the malicious binary.

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- Basic checks for absolute paths, but no validation of the executable's integrity.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- Verify the authenticity of the Deno CLI binary at the specified path.
- Restrict the path to known trusted locations or default installations.
**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must have write access to workspace/user settings to modify `deno.path`.

---

#### Vulnerability 5: Unrestricted Import Maps Leading to Code Injection
**Vulnerability Rank:** High
**Description:**
The extension supports import maps (`deno.importMap`) configured via workspace settings. An attacker can craft an import map pointing to malicious modules, leading to execution of untrusted code during dependency resolution.

**Steps to Trigger:**
1. The attacker creates an import map (`import_map.json`) redirecting standard Deno modules to malicious URLs.
2. The user enables the import map via `deno.importMap` configuration.
3. The extension resolves dependencies from the malicious URLs during runtime.

**Impact:**
Execution of malicious code via hijacked imports.

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- None identified. Import maps are trusted by default.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- Validate and restrict domains in import maps to known safe origins.
- Warn users before enabling import maps from untrusted sources.
**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must control the import map file in the workspace.

---

#### Vulnerability 6: Workspace Configuration Task Execution
**Vulnerability Rank:** High
**Description:**
The tasks sidebar executes Deno tasks defined in workspace configurations (`deno.json`). An attacker can define a malicious task in `deno.json` to execute arbitrary commands.

**Steps to Trigger:**
1. The attacker adds a task like:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "malicious-task",
     "command": "run",
     "args": ["--allow-run", "malicious.sh"]
   }
   ```
2. The user runs the task through the VS Code tasks interface.

**Impact:**
Arbitrary command execution via crafted task definitions.

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- None identified. Tasks are executed as defined.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- Enforce a strict schema for task definitions.
- Require user confirmation before executing tasks from untrusted origins.
**Preconditions:**
- Attacker has write access to `deno.json` in the workspace.

### Summary
All vulnerabilities remain valid and unmitigated. They stem from improper validation of user-configurable inputs (e.g., test arguments, debug configurations, import maps). Mitigations should prioritize input sanitization, schema validation, and user confirmation for sensitive operations.
