### Vulnerability Name: Insecure CORS Configuration
**Description**:
The backend's CORS configuration allows all origins (`["*"]`), which can lead to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) vulnerabilities. This misconfiguration permits any website to make requests to the API, potentially enabling unauthorized data access or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. The CORS middleware is set up in `backend/main.py`, where `allow_origins=["*"]` is explicitly configured.

**Trigger Steps**:
1. An attacker visits a malicious website.
2. The malicious site sends requests to the backend's endpoints (e.g., `/generate-code`).
3. The backend accepts the requests due to the unrestricted `allow_origins` setting.

**Impact**:
- Attackers can access sensitive data (e.g., generated code, API keys) through unauthorized cross-origin requests.
- Enables attacks like CSRF, causing unintended actions (e.g., generating malicious code) on behalf of authenticated users.

**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
- None. The CORS configuration explicitly allows all origins.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- Restrict `allow_origins` to specific trusted domains instead of `"*"`.
- Implement CSRF protection (e.g., tokens) for state-changing endpoints.

**Preconditions**:
- The backend is publicly accessible.

**Source Code Analysis**:
In `backend/main.py`:
```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Vulnerable line
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```
The `allow_origins` is set to `"*"`, allowing unrestricted cross-origin requests.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Deploy the backend.
2. Use a browser or tool (e.g., Postman) to send a request to `/generate-code` from a domain not in the allowed list.
3. Observe that the response is permitted (HTTP 200 status).
4. Use a malicious webpage to send requests to the API, demonstrating unauthorized access.

### Vulnerability Name: Exposure of User-Provided API Keys via Screenshot Endpoint
**Description**:
The `screenshot` endpoint (`routes/screenshot.py`) accepts an `apiKey` parameter from clients and uses it directly to interact with an external screenshot service (e.g., `screenshotone.com`). This allows users to specify arbitrary API keys, potentially enabling abuse of others' accounts. For example, an attacker could:
- Steal another user’s API key and use it to generate unauthorized screenshots.
- Exploit quota limits or incur costs using someone else's API key.

**Trigger Steps**:
1. An attacker crafts a request to `/api/screenshot` with a stolen API key.
2. The backend uses the provided key to interact with the screenshot service.
3. The legitimate API key owner is charged or their account is misused.

**Impact**:
- Financial loss due to unauthorized API usage.
- Privacy violations if screenshots are captured without consent.

**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
- None. The API key is directly taken from the client’s request.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- Validate and restrict the API key to only those owned by the authenticated user.
- Use a server-side API key instead of relying on client-provided keys.

**Preconditions**:
- The `screenshot` endpoint is publicly accessible.

**Source Code Analysis**:
In `routes/screenshot.py`:
```python
async def app_screenshot(request: ScreenshotRequest):
    # Extract the URL from the request body
    url = request.url
    api_key = request.apiKey  # Vulnerable line: API key provided by client

    image_bytes = await capture_screenshot(url, api_key=api_key)
```
The `apiKey` from the client’s request is directly passed to the screenshot service without validation.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Deploy the backend.
2. Send a POST request to `/api/screenshot` with a fake `apiKey` parameter.
3. Observe that the backend uses the provided key to take a screenshot.
4. Verify the screenshot service logs show the fake key being used.

### Vulnerability Name: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Screenshot Endpoint
**Description**:
The `/api/screenshot` endpoint takes a URL from user input and uses it to generate screenshots via an external service. An attacker can exploit this to target internal services or spoof requests to other domains, exposing sensitive data or triggering unintended actions.

**Trigger Steps**:
1. An attacker sends a request to `/api/screenshot` with `url=http://internal-service:port/sensitive-path`.
2. The backend processes this URL, potentially accessing internal resources or malicious destinations.

**Impact**:
High. Attackers can extract data from internal systems, trigger unintended API calls, or exploit other vulnerabilities via the exposed URL parameter.

**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. The URL is used directly without validation.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- Validate and restrict `url` to prevent access to non-public/internal domains.
- Sanitize input to block protocols like `file://` or `http://localhost`.

**Preconditions**: None. The endpoint is publicly accessible.

**Source Code Analysis**:
In `backend/routes/screenshot.py`:
```python
async def capture_screenshot(
    target_url: str, api_key: str, device: str = "desktop"
) -> bytes:
    api_base_url = "https://api.screenshotone.com/take"
    params = {
        "access_key": api_key,
        "url": target_url,  # Vulnerable parameter: user-controlled URL
        ...
    }
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(api_base_url, params=params)
```

**Security Test Case**:
1. Send a POST request to `http://backend:7001/api/screenshot` with JSON body:
```json
{
  "url": "http://internal-service:8080/secrets",
  "apiKey": "...",
  "device": "desktop"
}
```
2. Observe if the backend makes requests to the internal URL, exposing data.

### Vulnerability Name: Lack of Input Validation in Prompts
**Description**:
User-supplied data (e.g., image URLs, imported code) is directly incorporated into prompts for the LLM. Malicious input could trick the LLM into generating dangerous code or commands, leading to code injection vulnerabilities.

**Trigger Steps**:
1. An attacker provides a malicious image or code snippet as input.
2. The LLM generates harmful code (e.g., with XSS or command injection payloads).

**Impact**:
High. Injected malicious code could compromise frontend clients or server processes.

**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. Input is used directly without sanitization.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- Sanitize user-provided inputs to prevent malicious instructions in prompts.
- Validate and restrict content types for images and code.

**Preconditions**: User must provide malicious input.

**Source Code Analysis**:
In `backend/prompts/__init__.py`:
```python
user_content: list = [...]  # Includes user-supplied image_data_url
prompt_messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": system_content},
    {"role": "user", "content": user_content},  # Directly uses user data
]
```

**Security Test Case**:
1. Send a request with an image URL containing malicious instructions (e.g., `javascript:alert()`) to generate code.
2. Check if the generated code executes arbitrary JavaScript when rendered in the frontend.
