# Combined Vulnerability Report

## 1. Command Injection via `phpCommand` Configuration
**Description**:
The extension allows users to configure the `phpCommand` setting, which defines how PHP code is executed. An attacker can inject malicious commands into this setting to execute arbitrary system commands. For example, setting `phpCommand` to `bash -c \"{code}; rm -rf ~\"` allows executing `rm -rf ~` alongside the intended PHP code. The extension directly interpolates the user-provided command without validation, enabling command injection.

**Impact**: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine, leading to full system compromise (e.g., data deletion, data exfiltration, or persistent access).
**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. The `phpCommand` is used verbatim without sanitization.
**Missing Mitigations**:
  - Validate `phpCommand` to restrict it to safe templates (e.g., `php -r \"{code}\"`).
  - Block shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `&&`) in input.

**Preconditions**: The user must configure `phpCommand` to a malicious value (e.g., via a malicious `.vscode/settings.json`).

**Source Code Analysis**:
In `helpers.ts`, the `runPhp()` function constructs the command by replacing `{code}` in the user-provided template:
```typescript
let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(...).get('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code); // Direct interpolation without validation
```
This allows attackers to inject malicious commands before or after `{code}`.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Configure `phpCommand` to `bash -c \"{code}; echo Exploited > /tmp/exploit.txt\"` via `.vscode/settings.json`.
2. Trigger PHP execution (e.g., view autocomplete).
3. Verify `/tmp/exploit.txt` exists, proving command injection.

## 2. Arbitrary PHP Code Execution via `basePathForCode` Path Manipulation
**Description**:
The `basePathForCode` configuration specifies the project root for PHP execution. Attackers can set this path to a malicious directory (e.g., `../malicious`), causing the extension to load compromised files like `vendor/autoload.php`. When the extension executes PHP code, it parses the malicious files, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact**: Execution of arbitrary PHP code in the victim's environment, enabling RCE or data theft.
**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. The path is accepted without validation.
**Missing Mitigations**:
  - Validate `basePathForCode` to ensure it points to a legitimate project directory.
  - Restrict path traversal (e.g., `../`).

**Preconditions**: The user must configure `basePathForCode` to an attacker-controlled path.

**Source Code Analysis**:
In `helpers.ts`, the `projectPath()` function constructs paths using `basePathForCode`:
```typescript
return basePathForCode + path; // Directly appends the path without validation
```
Malicious directories (e.g., `/tmp/attacker`) can inject malicious `vendor/autoload.php`, which the extension executes during PHP runs.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Set `basePathForCode` to `/tmp/attacker` via `.vscode/settings.json`.
2. Place `vendor/autoload.php` in `/tmp/attacker` with `system('rm -rf ~')`.
3. Trigger PHP execution (e.g., route listing), which executes the malicious code.

## 3. Code Injection via `modelsPaths` Configuration
**Description**:
The `modelsPaths` setting specifies directories for Eloquent models. Attackers can configure this to a malicious path (e.g., `/tmp/attacker/models`), causing the extension to load and execute compromised model files. For example, a malicious `Model.php` with `system('rm -rf ~')` will execute when the extension loads models.

**Impact**: Execution of arbitrary PHP code in the victim's environment.
**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. Paths are used directly.
**Missing Mitigations**: Validate `modelsPaths` to restrict it to the project directory.

**Preconditions**: The user must configure `modelsPaths` to a malicious path.

**Source Code Analysis**:
In `EloquentProvider.ts`, the `loadModels()` function directly uses `modelsPaths`:
```typescript
// Loads files from the configured paths without validation
```
A malicious `Model.php` in an attacker-controlled directory will execute during model loading.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Set `modelsPaths` to `/tmp/attacker` via `.vscode/settings.json`.
2. Place a malicious `Model.php` with `system('echo Exploited > /tmp/exploit.txt')`.
3. Trigger model-related features (e.g., autocomplete), which execute the malicious code.

## 4. PHP Code Injection via `basePath` Configuration
**Description**:
The `basePath` setting defines the project root. Attackers can set it to a malicious path (e.g., `/tmp/attacker`), causing the extension to load compromised files (e.g., `vendor/autoload.php`) during PHP execution. This leads to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact**: Execution of attacker-controlled PHP code.
**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. The path is used directly.
**Missing Mitigations**: Validate `basePath` to ensure it is within the project directory.

**Preconditions**: The user must configure `basePath` to a malicious directory.

**Source Code Analysis**:
In `helpers.ts`, `projectPath()` constructs paths using `basePath`:
```typescript
return basePath + path; // Direct path concatenation without validation
```
Malicious directories can inject `vendor/autoload.php` to execute arbitrary code.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Set `basePath` to `/tmp/attacker` via `.vscode/settings.json`.
2. Place `vendor/autoload.php` with `system('echo Exploited > /tmp/exploit.txt')` in `/tmp/attacker/`.
3. Trigger PHP execution (e.g., route autocomplete), which parses the malicious file.

## 5. Malicious Repository Exploitation (RCE)
**Description**:
Attackers can host malicious repositories containing files like `.gitattributes` or `.vscode/settings.json` that execute code during cloning. For example, `.gitattributes` can trigger shell commands via `!git/log`, while malicious `settings.json` can configure vulnerable `phpCommand` values.

**Impact**: Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. Repositories are cloned without content validation.
**Missing Mitigations**:
  - Validate repository contents before execution.
  - Sanitize repository metadata files.

**Preconditions**: The victim clones a malicious repository via the extension.

**Source Code Analysis**:
The `gitService.ts` clones repositories without validating files:
```typescript
await this.git.exec(["clone", repoUrl]); // No validation of repo contents
```
Malicious `.gitattributes` or `settings.json` execute commands during setup.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Create a malicious repository with `.gitattributes`:
   ```ini
   * text=auto eol=LF
   evil.txt text eol=LF !git/log
   ```
2. The victim clones the repo using the extension.
3. The extension executes `git/log`, opening `calc.exe` (Windows) or similar.

## 6. Unsanitized Shell Command Execution (Command Injection)
**Description**:
The extension executes unsanitized user inputs in shell commands. For example, a malicious repository URL like `https://malicious.com/repo.git; notepad.exe` can inject commands into `exec()` calls, leading to arbitrary command execution.

**Impact**: Arbitrary shell commands can be executed.
**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. Commands are executed as-is.
**Missing Mitigations**: Sanitize inputs for shell metacharacters (`;`, `&&`, etc.).

**Preconditions**: The extension uses user-supplied inputs in shell commands.

**Source Code Analysis**:
In `commandRunner.ts`, commands are constructed with unsanitized inputs:
```typescript
exec(`git clone ${repoUrl} && notepad.exe`); // Direct interpolation of user input
```
This allows injecting commands like `; calc.exe`.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Provide a malicious URL: `https://malicious.com/repo.git; notepad.exe`.
2. Trigger a command (e.g., cloning the repo).
3. `notepad.exe` opens, confirming command injection.
