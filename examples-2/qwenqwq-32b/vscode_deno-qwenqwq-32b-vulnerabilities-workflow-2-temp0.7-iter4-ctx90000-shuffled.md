# Combined Vulnerability List

## Vulnerability 1: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious `deno.path` Configuration
**Description**:
The extension uses the user-configurable `deno.path` setting to locate the Deno executable. If this path is set to a malicious executable (e.g., through a symlink attack or direct configuration manipulation), the extension will execute it when starting the language server. The `getDenoCommandPath` function validates file existence but does not verify that the file is an actual Deno binary or trusted executable. An attacker can exploit this by pointing `deno.path` to a malicious script, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact**: Execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the VS Code process, potentially leading to system compromise.

**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
- The `getDenoCommandPath` function checks if the specified path exists.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- No validation that the file is a trusted Deno executable.
- No checks for symbolic links or path traversal in `deno.path`.

**Preconditions**:
- The attacker has write access to VS Code settings to configure `deno.path`.

**Source Code Analysis**:
- **client/src/util.ts**: `getDenoCommandPath()` resolves `deno.path` relative to workspace folders but only checks existence.
- **client/src/commands.ts**: The resolved path is directly used to start the Deno Language Server in `startLanguageServer()`.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Create a malicious script (e.g., `fake_deno.sh` for Linux/macOS or `fake_deno.exe` for Windows) that writes to a file in `/tmp/pwned` (or `C:\pwned`).
2. Set `deno.path` to the malicious script’s path via VS Code settings.
3. Restart VS Code or run a Deno command (e.g., `Deno: Enable`).
4. Check if the malicious script executed and created `/tmp/pwned` (or `C:\pwned`).

## Vulnerability 2: Command Injection via Unsanitized Task Definitions in `deno.json`
**Description**:
The extension executes tasks defined in `deno.json` without validating the command-line arguments. Attackers can craft malicious `args` fields in task definitions to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters (e.g., `; rm -rf /`). The `buildDenoTask` function directly passes user-provided arguments to the Deno command without sanitization.

**Impact**: Arbitrary commands can execute with permissions tied to the user’s workspace, potentially leading to data destruction or code execution.

**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
- None.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- No checks for shell metacharacters in task arguments.

**Preconditions**:
- The workspace contains a malicious `deno.json` file.

**Source Code Analysis**:
- **client/src/tasks.ts**: `buildDenoTask()` directly uses `definition.args` in the command line.
- **client/src/tasks_sidebar.ts**: The language server’s task responses are used without validation.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Create a `deno.json` with a task like:
   ```json
   {
     "tasks": [{
       "name": "test",
       "command": "run",
       "args": ["--allow-all", "test.ts; echo 'VULN' > /tmp/vuln"]
     }]
   }
   ```
2. Run the task and check if `/tmp/vuln` (or equivalent) is created.

## Vulnerability 3: Environment Variable Injection via `deno.env` and `deno.envFile`
**Description**:
The extension reads environment variables from `deno.env` and `deno.envFile` settings and passes them to the Deno process. An attacker can set environment variables like `DENO_DIR` to a malicious path or inject shell metacharacters into variables, leading to arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation.

**Impact**: Execution of arbitrary code or escalation of privileges via manipulated environment variables.

**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
- None; variables are directly used as configured.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- No validation of variables or their values.
- No restriction on variables like `DENO_DIR` to prevent path traversal.

**Preconditions**:
- The attacker can modify VS Code settings to set malicious `deno.env` or `deno.envFile`.

**Source Code Analysis**:
- **client/src/commands.ts**: Environment variables from `deno.env` are passed directly to the Deno process in `startLanguageServer()`.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Set `deno.env` to include `DENO_DIR=/tmp/evil_cache; rm -rf /`.
2. Start the Deno Language Server; the shell command executes due to unescaped variables.

---

## Vulnerability 4: Command Injection in Test Arguments
**Description**:
The `test` command in `client/src/commands.ts` uses `deno.codeLens.testArgs` to construct command-line arguments. If an attacker sets these arguments to include malicious content (e.g., `["--allow-run", "--", "&& touch /tmp/exploit"]`), the Deno CLI will execute the injected command.

**Impact**: Execution of arbitrary commands with permissions granted by the test context.

**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
- None. User-provided arguments are unsanitized.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- No validation or escaping of user-provided test arguments.

**Preconditions**:
- The attacker can control `deno.codeLens.testArgs` in workspace settings.

**Source Code Analysis**:
- **client/src/commands.ts**: `test()` constructs commands directly using `testArgs` from configuration.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Set `deno.codeLens.testArgs` to `["--allow-run", "--", "&& touch /tmp/exploit"]`.
2. Run a test; the `touch` command executes, creating the file.

---

## Vulnerability 5: Malicious Module Imports via Unvalidated Import Maps
**Description**:
The extension processes import maps from `deno.json` without validating URLs, allowing attackers to redirect module imports to malicious remote URLs. A crafted `importMap` field in the configuration can trick the language server into fetching and executing hostile modules (e.g., `https://attacker.com/malicious.js`).

**Impact**: Execution of remote malicious modules with Deno permissions, potentially leading to code execution or data exfiltration.

**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
- None; the import map is directly passed to the language server.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- No validation of URLs in import maps.

**Preconditions**:
- The workspace includes a malicious `deno.json` or `import_map.json`.

**Source Code Analysis**:
- **client/src/extension.ts**: The Deno configuration’s `importMap` is passed to the server without validation.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Create an import map redirecting a module to a malicious server.
2. Monitor network requests to see if Deno fetches from the attacker’s URL.

## Vulnerability 6: Command Injection During Deno Upgrade
**Description**:
The `denoUpgradePromptAndExecute` function in `client/src/upgrade.ts` constructs upgrade commands using user-provided arguments, which can be manipulated to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact**: Exploitation allows running arbitrary commands during upgrade.

**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
- None. Environment variables and paths are directly applied.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- Input validation for environment variables and upgrade arguments.

**Preconditions**:
- The attacker can set malicious `deno.env` or `envFile` settings.

**Source Code Analysis**:
- **client/src/upgrade.ts**: Upgrade commands are constructed using unsanitized `env` and `args` from user configuration.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Set `deno.envFile` to point to a file with `MALICIOUS_CMD="echo VULN > /tmp/upgrade.txt"`.
2. Run the upgrade command. Check `/tmp/upgrade.txt` exists.
