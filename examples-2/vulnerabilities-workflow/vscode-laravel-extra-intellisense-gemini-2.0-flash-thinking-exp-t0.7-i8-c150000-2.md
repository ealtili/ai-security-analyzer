### Vulnerability List for Laravel Extra Intellisense VSCode Extension

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `phpCommand` configuration
* Description:
    1. A threat actor crafts a malicious Laravel repository.
    2. A victim opens this repository in VSCode with the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension installed.
    3. The victim has configured a custom `phpCommand` setting in VSCode to a value like `bash -c "{code}"` or similar, intending to use a shell interpreter.
    4. The extension, when activated in the malicious repository, attempts to gather Laravel project information (e.g., routes, views, configs) to provide autocompletion features. This involves executing PHP code by calling `Helpers.runLaravel` internally.
    5. `Helpers.runLaravel` then calls `Helpers.runPhp`, which substitutes the `{code}` placeholder in the user-configured `phpCommand` with the generated PHP code.
    6. Due to insufficient sanitization of the generated PHP code within `Helpers.runPhp`, it is possible to inject arbitrary shell commands. Specifically, the current escaping mechanism in `runPhp` only replaces double quotes (`"`) with escaped double quotes (`\"`), which is inadequate to prevent command injection when using `bash -c` or similar shell commands as `phpCommand`. Characters like backticks (`` ` ``), dollar signs (`$`) for variable expansion, and command separators (`;`, `&`, `|`) are not properly neutralized for shell execution.
    7. When `child_process.exec` is executed with the constructed command (user-defined `phpCommand` with embedded, unsanitized PHP code), the injected shell commands are executed on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
* Impact:
    Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation allows the threat actor to execute arbitrary shell commands on the victim's machine. This can lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, malware installation, and other malicious activities.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The `runPhp` function in `src/helpers.ts` attempts to escape double quotes in the PHP code using `code = code.replace(/\"/g, "\\\"");`.
    - Platform-specific escaping is applied for `$` and escaped quotes (`'`,`"`) on Linux-like systems.
    ```typescript
    static async runPhp(code: string, description: string|null = null) : Promise<string> {
        code = code.replace(/\"/g, "\\\"");
        if (['linux', 'openbsd', 'sunos', 'darwin'].some(unixPlatforms => os.platform().includes(unixPlatforms))) {
            code = code.replace(/\$/g, "\\$");
            code = code.replace(/\\\\'/g, '\\\\\\\\\'');
            code = code.replace(/\\\\"/g, '\\\\\\\\\"');
        }
        let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
        let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);
        cp.exec(command, ...);
    }
    ```
    This mitigation is insufficient as it does not prevent injection when using `bash -c` and other shell interpreters because it does not escape other shell metacharacters.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Robust sanitization of the PHP code before embedding it into the `phpCommand` to properly escape all shell metacharacters relevant to the shell interpreter being used (if configurable). Ideally, use parameterized execution if possible, but with `php -r` and shell execution via `child_process.exec`, this might be challenging.
    - Consider validating or restricting the `phpCommand` setting to prevent users from using potentially dangerous commands like `bash -c`. However, this might limit legitimate use cases, such as Docker or Sail configurations.
    - Improve documentation to prominently warn users about the security implications of modifying the `phpCommand` setting, especially when using shell wrappers, and advise them to only use trusted configurations.
* Preconditions:
    - Victim has installed the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension.
    - Victim opens a malicious Laravel repository in VSCode.
    - Victim has configured a custom `phpCommand` setting in VSCode that uses a shell interpreter, such as `bash -c "{code}"`. While the vulnerability might be exploitable even with the default `php -r "{code}"` under certain conditions, using `bash -c` significantly increases the attack surface and ease of exploitation.
* Source code analysis:
    - File: `src/helpers.ts`
    - Function: `runPhp`
    - Vulnerable code section:
        ```typescript
        let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
        let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);
        cp.exec(command, ...);
        ```
    - The `commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code)` line is where the unsanitized `$code` is embedded into the command. The subsequent `cp.exec(command, ...)` executes this potentially malicious command.
    - The existing escaping mechanism (`code = code.replace(/\"/g, "\\\"")`) is inadequate for robust command injection prevention, especially with flexible shell interpreters.
* Security test case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Install the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension in VSCode.
        - Create a new empty directory to simulate a Laravel project workspace.
        - In VSCode settings (`settings.json`), configure the `phpCommand` for "Laravel Extra Intellisense" to: `"phpCommand": "bash -c \\"{code}\\""`. This sets up the vulnerable execution environment using `bash -c`.
        - Open the empty directory in VSCode.
        - Create a dummy PHP file (e.g., `test.php`) in the workspace. This is to trigger the extension's functionality, though the file content is not critical for this test case.
    2. **Exploit:**
        - Modify the `src/helpers.ts` file in your local extension installation (usually found in `~/.vscode/extensions/amiralizadeh9480.laravel-extra-intellisense-*`).
        - In the `runLaravel` function, or directly in `runPhp` for testing purposes, modify the `$code` variable to include a malicious payload. For example, within `runPhp` just before `let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);`, add:
        ```typescript
        code = 'system(\'touch /tmp/vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-pwned\'); echo \\\'___VSCODE_LARAVEL_EXTRA_INSTELLISENSE_OUTPUT___\\\' . json_encode(["test"]) . \\\'___VSCODE_LARAVEL_EXTRA_INSTELLISENSE_END_OUTPUT___\\\' ;';
        ```
        This injected code attempts to execute `touch /tmp/vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-pwned` using `system()` and then echoes a JSON string to maintain the expected output format for the extension to avoid immediate errors.
    3. **Trigger vulnerability:**
        - Open the dummy `test.php` file in VSCode. This should trigger the Laravel Extra Intellisense extension to activate and execute PHP code using `runLaravel` and `runPhp`.
    4. **Verify RCE:**
        - After opening the file and allowing the extension to run, check if the file `/tmp/vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-pwned` has been created on your system. If it exists, it confirms successful Remote Code Execution via command injection.

This security test case demonstrates that by configuring a `phpCommand` that uses a shell interpreter and by injecting shell commands through the `code` parameter due to insufficient sanitization, it's possible to achieve RCE. In a real attack scenario, a malicious repository would be crafted to trigger the extension's features, and if the victim has a vulnerable `phpCommand` configuration, the attacker could execute commands on the victim's machine.
