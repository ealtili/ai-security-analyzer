## Vulnerability List for Laravel Extra Intellisense VSCode Extension

### 1. Command Injection via `phpCommand` setting

- Description:
    1. A threat actor creates a malicious Laravel repository.
    2. The threat actor adds a `.vscode/settings.json` file to the repository, configuring the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting to inject malicious shell commands. For example:
       ```json
       {
           "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r '`touch /tmp/pwned`' \"{code}\""
       }
    3. The victim opens this malicious repository in VSCode with the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension installed and activated.
    4. The extension attempts to provide autocompletion features, which triggers the execution of PHP code using the configured `phpCommand`.
    5. Due to insufficient sanitization, the injected shell commands within the malicious `phpCommand` setting are executed by the system shell. In the example above, this would create a file named `/tmp/pwned`.

- Impact:
    Remote Code Execution (RCE). The threat actor can execute arbitrary shell commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to complete compromise of the victim's system, including data theft, malware installation, and further attacks.

- Vulnerability Rank: critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    The `runPhp` function in `src/helpers.ts` attempts to mitigate command injection by escaping double quotes (`"`), dollar signs (`$`), and some escaped quotes (`\\'`, `\\"`). However, this escaping is insufficient to prevent command injection through backticks, `$(...)`, or other shell command substitution techniques.

    ```typescript
    static async runPhp(code: string, description: string|null = null) : Promise<string> {
        code = code.replace(/\"/g, "\\\"");
        if (['linux', 'openbsd', 'sunos', 'darwin'].some(unixPlatforms => os.platform().includes(unixPlatforms))) {
            code = code.replace(/\$/g, "\\$");
            code = code.replace(/\\\\'/g, '\\\\\\\\\'');
            code = code.replace(/\\\\"/g, '\\\\\\\\\"');
        }
        let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
        let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);
        // ... exec command ...
    }
    ```

- Missing mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** The extension needs to implement robust sanitization of the `phpCommand` setting to prevent injection of shell metacharacters and commands. Instead of simple string replacement and escaping, consider using parameterized command execution if possible, or a more secure method of escaping shell metacharacters that accounts for all injection vectors.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Consider if running arbitrary PHP code is absolutely necessary for all features. If possible, restrict the functionality to avoid executing potentially dangerous commands.
    - **Security Warnings:** Display a clear warning to the user when they change the `phpCommand` setting, highlighting the security risks involved in executing arbitrary commands.

- Preconditions:
    1. The victim has the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension installed and activated in VSCode.
    2. The victim opens a malicious Laravel repository in VSCode.
    3. The malicious repository contains a `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets a malicious `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand`.

- Source code analysis:
    1. **`src/helpers.ts` - `runPhp` function:**
       ```typescript
       static async runPhp(code: string, description: string|null = null) : Promise<string> {
           code = code.replace(/\"/g, "\\\"");
           if (['linux', 'openbsd', 'sunos', 'darwin'].some(unixPlatforms => os.platform().includes(unixPlatforms))) {
               code = code.replace(/\$/g, "\\$");
               code = code.replace(/\\\\'/g, '\\\\\\\\\'');
               code = code.replace(/\\\\"/g, '\\\\\\\\\"');
           }
           let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
           let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);
           let out = new Promise<string>(function (resolve, error) {
               if (description != null) {
                   Helpers.outputChannel?.info("Laravel Extra Intellisense command started: " + description);
               }

               cp.exec(command, // Vulnerable command execution
                   { cwd: vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders && vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders.length > 0 ? vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0].uri.fsPath : undefined },
                   function (err, stdout, stderr) {
                       if (err == null) {
                           if (description != null) {
                               Helpers.outputChannel?.info("Laravel Extra Intellisense Resolved: " + description);
                           }
                           resolve(stdout);
                       } else {
                           const errorOutput = stderr.length > 0 ? stderr : stdout;
                           Helpers.outputChannel?.error("Laravel Extra Intellisense Error:\n " + (description ?? '') + '\n\n' + errorOutput);
                           Helpers.showErrorPopup();
                           error(errorOutput);
                       }
                   }
               );
           });
           return out;
       }
       ```
       - The vulnerability lies in the `cp.exec(command, ...)` line. The `command` variable is constructed by directly replacing `{code}` in the user-configurable `phpCommand` setting, with insufficient sanitization. This allows for command injection.

- Security test case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Repository:**
       - Create a new directory, e.g., `malicious-laravel-repo`.
       - Inside `malicious-laravel-repo`, initialize a basic Laravel project (you can use `laravel new malicious-app`, but a minimal structure is sufficient for this test).
       - Create a `.vscode` directory inside `malicious-laravel-repo`.
       - Inside `.vscode`, create a `settings.json` file with the following content:
         ```json
         {
             "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r 'system(\"touch /tmp/pwned\");' \"{code}\""
         }
         ```
       - Commit and push this repository to a public or private Git repository.

    2. **Victim Actions:**
       - Ensure the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension is installed and activated in VSCode.
       - Clone the `malicious-laravel-repo` to a local machine.
       - Open the cloned repository in VSCode.
       - Open any PHP file within the repository (e.g., create a simple `test.php` file with `<?php`). Opening a Blade file will also trigger the vulnerability.

    3. **Verification:**
       - After opening the PHP file, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on the victim's system. On Linux/macOS, you can use the command `ls /tmp/pwned`. On Windows, check for the file in the `C:\tmp` directory (or adjust the path in `settings.json` accordingly, e.g., `cmd /c "type nul > C:\tmp\pwned"`).
       - If the `/tmp/pwned` file is created, this confirms that the command injection vulnerability is present and exploitable, leading to arbitrary command execution.

This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to achieve Remote Code Execution on a developer's machine simply by enticing them to open a malicious Laravel project in VSCode with the vulnerable extension installed.
