### Vulnerability List

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in `phpCommand` setting

*   **Description:**
    The `Laravel Extra Intellisense` extension allows users to configure the command used to execute PHP code via the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting. This setting is directly used in the `runPhp` function within `helpers.ts` to execute arbitrary PHP code for features like autocompletion. If a user opens a workspace containing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file that overrides this setting with a command injecting malicious shell code, the extension will execute this injected code when it attempts to run Laravel commands in the background. This can lead to arbitrary command execution on the victim's machine.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1.  An attacker creates a malicious Laravel repository.
    2.  Within this repository, the attacker creates a `.vscode` directory.
    3.  Inside the `.vscode` directory, the attacker creates a `settings.json` file.
    4.  In `settings.json`, the attacker defines the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting with a malicious payload, for example:
        ```json
        {
            "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}\" && touch /tmp/pwned"
        }
        ```
    5.  The attacker hosts this malicious repository publicly (e.g., on GitHub).
    6.  A victim, who has the `Laravel Extra Intellisense` extension installed, clones or downloads this malicious repository and opens it in VSCode.
    7.  When the extension activates in the opened workspace, it reads the workspace settings, including the malicious `phpCommand`.
    8.  Subsequently, when the extension tries to gather information from the Laravel application (e.g., for route completion), it uses the configured `phpCommand` to execute PHP code.
    9.  Due to the command injection, the attacker's malicious command (`touch /tmp/pwned` in the example) will be executed after the intended PHP command.

*   **Impact:**
    Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the machine of a user who opens a malicious Laravel project in VSCode with the `Laravel Extra Intellisense` extension installed. This could allow the attacker to:
    *   Steal sensitive data from the victim's machine.
    *   Install malware.
    *   Pivot to other systems on the victim's network.
    *   Modify or delete files.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The provided code directly uses the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting without any sanitization or validation.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:** The extension should sanitize and validate the `phpCommand` setting to prevent command injection. It should ensure that only the `php` command is executed and that no additional commands can be injected.
    *   **Restricting Execution Environment:** Consider using safer methods for executing PHP code, such as using a dedicated API if Laravel provides one, or running PHP in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
    *   **Warning to User:** When using a custom `phpCommand`, the extension should display a clear warning to the user about the security risks involved and advise caution when using custom commands from untrusted sources.
    *   **Default to Safe Command:** The default `phpCommand` should be as safe as possible, avoiding constructs that could easily lead to injection.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The victim must have the `Laravel Extra Intellisense` extension installed in VSCode.
    *   The victim must open a workspace in VSCode that contains a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file setting a malicious `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand`.
    *   The extension must attempt to execute a Laravel command after the workspace is opened.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**

    1.  **`src/helpers.ts` - `runPhp` function:**
        ```typescript
        static async runPhp(code: string, description: string|null = null) : Promise<string> {
            code = code.replace(/\"/g, "\\\"");
            if (['linux', 'openbsd', 'sunos', 'darwin'].some(unixPlatforms => os.platform().includes(unixPlatforms))) {
                code = code.replace(/\$/g, "\\$");
                code = code.replace(/\\\\'/g, '\\\\\\\\\'');
                code = code.replace(/\\\\"/g, '\\\\\\\\\"');
            }
            let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\""; // Vulnerable line: Retrieves phpCommand from config
            let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code); // Vulnerable line: Replaces {code} without sanitizing commandTemplate
            let out = new Promise<string>(function (resolve, error) {
                if (description != null) {
                    Helpers.outputChannel?.info("Laravel Extra Intellisense command started: " + description);
                }

                cp.exec(command, // Vulnerable line: Executes command directly using cp.exec
                    { cwd: vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders && vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders.length > 0 ? vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0].uri.fsPath : undefined },
                    function (err, stdout, stderr) {
                        // ...
                    }
                );
            });
            return out;
        }
        ```
        The `runPhp` function retrieves the `phpCommand` setting from the VSCode configuration. It then uses `String.replace()` to insert the `$code` into the `phpCommand` template. Critically, there is no sanitization of the `commandTemplate` itself, which is directly derived from user configuration.  The resulting `command` is then passed to `cp.exec()`, which executes it as a shell command. This is a classic command injection vulnerability.

    2.  **`src/helpers.ts` - `runLaravel` function:**
        ```typescript
        static runLaravel(code: string, description: string|null = null) : Promise<string> {
            // ...
            var command =
                "define('LARAVEL_START', microtime(true));" +
                "require_once '" + Helpers.projectPath("vendor/autoload.php", true) + "';" +
                // ... more php code ...
                "	echo '___VSCODE_LARAVEL_EXTRA_INSTELLISENSE_OUTPUT___';" +
                    code + // User-provided code is inserted here, but the overall command is built using phpCommand
                "	echo '___VSCODE_LARAVEL_EXTRA_INSTELLISENSE_END_OUTPUT___';" +
                // ... more php code ...
                "exit($status);"

            var self = this;

            return new Promise(function (resolve, error) {
                self.runPhp(command, description) // Calls runPhp, which uses the vulnerable phpCommand
                    .then(function (result: string) {
                        // ...
                    })
                    .catch(function (e : Error) {
                        error(e);
                    });
            });
        }
        ```
        The `runLaravel` function constructs a larger PHP script, embedding the provided `$code` within it. It then calls `runPhp` to execute this script. Since `runPhp` is vulnerable to command injection via `phpCommand`, `runLaravel` also becomes a vector if the `phpCommand` setting is maliciously configured.

    3.  **Usage throughout Providers:**
        Almost all providers (e.g., `AuthProvider.ts`, `ConfigProvider.ts`, `RouteProvider.ts`, `ViewProvider.ts`, etc.) use `Helpers.runLaravel` to fetch data needed for autocompletion. This means all features relying on these providers are potentially vulnerable if a malicious `phpCommand` is configured.

*   **Security Test Case:**

    1.  **Setup:**
        *   Ensure you have the `Laravel Extra Intellisense` extension installed in VSCode.
        *   Clone any Laravel project or create a new one for testing.

    2.  **Create Malicious Settings:**
        *   In the root of your Laravel project, create a directory named `.vscode` if it doesn't exist.
        *   Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json`.
        *   Add the following JSON content to `settings.json` to inject a command that creates a file named `pwned` in the `/tmp` directory (or `C:\Windows\Temp` on Windows):
            ```json
            {
                "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}\" && touch /tmp/pwned"
            }
            ```
            *(For Windows, use: `\"LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand\": \"php -r \\\"{code}\\\" && type nul > C:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\pwned\"`)*

    3.  **Trigger Extension Activity:**
        *   Open any PHP or Blade file in your Laravel project (e.g., a controller or a view).
        *   Trigger autocompletion in a context where the extension would normally execute a Laravel command. For example, in a Blade file, type `@route('` to trigger route autocompletion, or in a PHP file, type `Route::get('', function () { route('')` to trigger route name autocompletion.
        *   Alternatively, simply opening a Laravel project with the extension active might be enough to trigger background tasks that execute Laravel commands.

    4.  **Verify Command Injection:**
        *   After triggering the extension, check if the `pwned` file has been created in the `/tmp` directory (or `C:\Windows\Temp`).
        *   On Linux/macOS: `ls /tmp/pwned`
        *   On Windows: `dir C:\Windows\Temp\pwned`
        *   If the file `pwned` exists, it confirms that the injected command part (`touch /tmp/pwned`) of the malicious `phpCommand` was executed, demonstrating command injection.
