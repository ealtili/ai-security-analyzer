# Combined Vulnerabilities

Below is the merged list of vulnerabilities from the provided lists. Duplicate vulnerabilities have been consolidated into two distinct entries based on the configuration setting they target: one affecting the `phpCommand` configuration and the other affecting the `basePathForCode` configuration.

---

## 1. Command Injection via "phpCommand" Configuration Override

**Vulnerability Name:**
Command Injection via "phpCommand" Configuration Override

**Description:**
The extension retrieves the configuration setting `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` when processing PHP files. The execution flow is as follows:

1. **Configuration Retrieval:**
   - The extension reads the value of `phpCommand` from the workspace configuration. Although a safe default (e.g., `php -r "{code}"`) is provided, this value can be overridden by a `.vscode/settings.json` file.

2. **Placeholder Replacement:**
   - In the function `Helpers.runPhp`, the extension replaces the `{code}` placeholder within the command template with internally generated PHP code.
   - No sanitization or validation is performed on either the configured value or the substituted code.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - The resulting string is passed directly to Node’s `cp.exec()` function, which executes the command in the shell.
   - An attacker controlling the configuration can append shell meta‐characters or malicious commands. For example, an override such as:
     ```
     php -r "{code}"; echo MALICIOUS_COMMAND_EXECUTED
     ```
   - This manipulation results in injected commands being executed once the extension processes a PHP file.

**Steps to Trigger the Vulnerability:**
1. **Craft Malicious Repository:**
   - Create a repository that includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file.
   - Override the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` by inserting a payload like:
     ```json
     {
       "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}\"; echo MALICIOUS_COMMAND_EXECUTED"
     }
     ```

2. **Open Workspace in VSCode:**
   - Launch VSCode and open the repository so that the malicious workspace settings are loaded.

3. **Trigger Execution:**
   - Open a PHP file or invoke any extension functionality that calls `Helpers.runPhp`.

4. **Observe Outcome:**
   - Check the output channel or terminal for the string `MALICIOUS_COMMAND_EXECUTED`. Its presence indicates that the injected command was executed.

**Impact:**
- **Arbitrary System Command Execution:** The injected commands run with the privileges of the VSCode process, which can lead to a complete compromise of the machine.
- **Potential Full Machine Compromise:** Once arbitrary commands can be executed, an attacker may exfiltrate data, install malware, or pivot within the network.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- A safe default value for `phpCommand` is provided.
- However, when overridden by workspace settings, **no runtime sanitization or input validation is applied** on the configuration value.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Input Validation:** Validate that the overridden `phpCommand` contains only expected and safe characters.
- **Sanitization:** Sanitize the configuration value to escape shell meta‐characters before placeholder replacement.
- **Safer Execution Methods:** Consider using APIs that separate command arguments (avoiding string concatenation) to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

**Preconditions:**
- The victim opens a repository that contains a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file with an overridden `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand`.
- The extension is activated to process PHP files (or explicitly triggered), causing the unsafe command to be constructed and executed.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. **Configuration Retrieval:**
   ```javascript
   let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
   ```
   - The configuration value is directly read and can be overridden by a malicious workspace settings file.

2. **Placeholder Replacement:**
   ```javascript
   let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);
   ```
   - No sanitization is applied to the value inserted in place of `{code}`.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - The command is then passed to Node's `cp.exec()`:
     ```javascript
     cp.exec(command, (error, stdout, stderr) => { /* ... */ });
     ```
   - This allows any shell meta‐characters in the configuration override to be executed by the shell.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Preparation:**
   - Create a workspace with a `.vscode/settings.json` file containing:
     ```json
     {
       "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}\"; echo MALICIOUS_COMMAND_EXECUTED"
     }
     ```
2. **Execution:**
   - Open the repository in VSCode.
   - Trigger PHP processing by opening a PHP file or invoking the extension’s command that calls `Helpers.runPhp`.
3. **Verification:**
   - Inspect the terminal or extension output for the presence of `MALICIOUS_COMMAND_EXECUTED`. Its appearance confirms that the injected command was executed successfully.

## 2. PHP Code Injection via "basePathForCode" Configuration Override

**Vulnerability Name:**
PHP Code Injection via "basePathForCode" Configuration Override

**Description:**
The extension uses the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode` configuration setting to build file paths for including crucial PHP files (e.g., `bootstrap/app.php` or `vendor/autoload.php`). The execution flow is as follows:

1. **Configuration Reading:**
   - The helper function `Helpers.projectPath` retrieves the value of `basePathForCode`:
     ```javascript
     let basePathForCode = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('basePathForCode');
     return basePathForCode + path;
     ```
   - This value is concatenated with a fixed relative path without any validation or sanitization.

2. **PHP Command Construction:**
   - In `Helpers.runLaravel`, the function constructs a PHP command:
     ```javascript
     "require_once '" + Helpers.projectPath("bootstrap/app.php", true) + "';"
     ```
   - A malicious configuration value can break out of the intended string literal.

3. **Injection Example:**
   - If an attacker sets:
     ```
     "dummy'; system('echo INJECTED_PHP_CODE'); //"
     ```
   - The constructed PHP code becomes:
     ```php
     require_once 'dummy'; system('echo INJECTED_PHP_CODE'); //bootstrap/app.php';
     ```
   - The injected PHP code (`system('echo INJECTED_PHP_CODE')`) is executed on the server.

**Steps to Trigger the Vulnerability:**
1. **Craft Malicious Repository:**
   - Create a repository that contains a `.vscode/settings.json` file overriding `LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode`:
     ```json
     {
       "LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode": "dummy'; system('echo INJECTED_PHP_CODE'); //"
     }
     ```

2. **Open Workspace in VSCode:**
   - Open the repository in VSCode and allow the malicious settings to be loaded.

3. **Trigger Execution:**
   - Initiate an action that causes the extension to call `Helpers.runLaravel` (for example, triggering autocompletion for Laravel files).

4. **Observe Outcome:**
   - Check the output from the PHP execution (or monitoring logs) for evidence that `INJECTED_PHP_CODE` has been output or executed.

**Impact:**
- **Arbitrary PHP Code Execution:** Running injected PHP code can allow an attacker to read or modify critical files, exfiltrate data, or control the Laravel application.
- **Potential Full System Compromise:** Given the scope of PHP’s execution abilities, the injected code can lead to a comprehensive system compromise.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- No sanitization or validation of the `basePathForCode` configuration value is performed.
- The extension assumes that configuration values are safe, directly concatenating them into PHP commands.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Sanitization and Input Validation:** Validate that the `basePathForCode` value contains only safe and expected characters.
- **Whitelist Allowed Values:** Enforce a whitelist for acceptable file path characters to prevent injection.
- **Safe String Construction:** Use parameterized methods or safe APIs when constructing file paths to avoid direct concatenation that permits code injection.

**Preconditions:**
- The victim opens a repository containing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file with an overridden `LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode`.
- The extension is activated and calls `Helpers.runLaravel` (or a similar function) that uses the unsafe configuration value in constructing a PHP include statement.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. **Configuration Reading:**
   - In `Helpers.projectPath`:
     ```javascript
     let basePathForCode = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('basePathForCode');
     return basePathForCode + path;
     ```
   - The configuration value is concatenated with the file path without sanitization.

2. **PHP Command Construction:**
   - In `Helpers.runLaravel`:
     ```javascript
     "require_once '" + Helpers.projectPath("bootstrap/app.php", true) + "';"
     ```
   - A malicious value can break out of the quotes, injecting additional PHP code.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - The PHP interpreter executes the final malformed command:
     ```php
     require_once 'dummy'; system('echo INJECTED_PHP_CODE'); //bootstrap/app.php';
     ```
   - This results in the injected PHP function call being executed.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Preparation:**
   - Create a repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` file containing:
     ```json
     {
       "LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode": "dummy'; system('echo INJECTED_PHP_CODE'); //"
     }
     ```
2. **Execution:**
   - Open the repository in VSCode and ensure that workspace settings are applied.
   - Trigger the extension functionality that executes PHP code (e.g., by opening a PHP file that causes autocompletion features to initialize).
3. **Verification:**
   - Monitor the PHP execution output or logs for the presence of `INJECTED_PHP_CODE`.
   - The execution of the injected code confirms the vulnerability.

*Note: In both vulnerabilities, the absence of proper sanitization and validation for user-controlled configuration values leads to severe injection risks. Addressing these issues is critical to prevent arbitrary command and code execution in the host environment.*
