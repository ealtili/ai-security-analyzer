# Combined Vulnerabilities List

---

## 1. Insecure Deserialization via Pickle in Component Caching

**Description:**
The framework caches full component trees (including parent and child states) using Python’s built‑in pickle module. In several parts of the code (for example, in the class methods of `CacheableComponent` within `django_unicorn/cacher.py`), the component state is first serialized via `pickle.dumps()` and later restored with an unguarded call to `pickle.loads()`.

**Step‑by‑step Trigger Scenario:**
1. An attacker determines or guesses the cache key format (typically `"unicorn:component:<component_id>"`).
2. The attacker identifies that a cache backend (such as Redis or Memcached) is misconfigured or exposed (e.g., lacking authentication or being shared/multi‑tenant).
3. Using an external tool or direct cache client access, the attacker writes a malicious payload (crafted using Python’s pickle) into the proper cache key.
4. When an end user triggers a component state restoration (for example, through an AJAX call to the unicorn message endpoint), the stored payload is retrieved and deserialized via `pickle.loads()`.
5. The deserialization of attacker‑controlled data causes arbitrary Python code execution on the server.

**Impact:**
An attacker could achieve full remote code execution (RCE). This may lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, lateral movement within the environment, or other critical impacts.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The framework leverages Django’s built‑in caching framework.
- Cache keys are generated internally (e.g., using a deterministic format) and, in many deployments, the cache backend is assumed to be secure (e.g., local memory cache or restricted Redis/Memcached).

**Missing Mitigations:**
- No integrity verification (e.g., digital signatures or HMAC) is performed on cached, pickled data.
- There is no fallback to a safer serialization format (such as JSON).
- The framework relies entirely on correct backend configuration to prevent unauthorized cache modifications.

**Preconditions:**
- The underlying cache backend must be writable or injectable by an attacker.
- The application must use the default pickle‑based caching without an overridden, secure implementation.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In the caching module (`django_unicorn/cacher.py`), the component state is passed to `pickle.dumps()` when saving to the cache.
2. Later, functions such as `restore_from_cache()` call `pickle.loads()` to convert the cached bytes back into a component object without any verification.
3. This lack of validation means that if the cache backend is compromised, malicious payloads will be accepted and executed.

**Security Test Case (Step by Step):**
1. **Setup a Test Environment:**
   - Configure the Django application to use a cache backend (for instance, Redis) that is intentionally exposed with weak or no authentication.
   - Point the application’s cache (via settings such as `UNICORN["CACHE_ALIAS"]`) to this insecure backend.
2. **Craft a Malicious Payload:**
   - Using Python, create a payload (for example, an instance of a dummy class whose unpickling side effect writes a log entry or creates a file) and serialize it with `pickle.dumps()`.
3. **Inject into the Cache:**
   - Determine the specific cache key (e.g., `"unicorn:component:<target_component_id>"`) and use a cache client to overwrite that key with the malicious payload.
4. **Trigger Restoration:**
   - Send an HTTP POST request to the unicorn message endpoint (e.g., `/unicorn/message`) so that the framework attempts to load the affected component.
5. **Verify Exploitation:**
   - Confirm that the payload’s side effect (such as file creation or log modification) occurs, indicating that arbitrary code was executed.
6. **Cleanup:**
   - Remove the malicious cache entry and restore proper cache configuration.

## 2. Information Disclosure via Detailed Component Load Errors in Dynamic Component Loading

**Description:**
The application dynamically loads component classes based on data provided through the URL or HTTP request. When an attacker supplies a non‑existent or malformed component name, the loader attempts to resolve the module and class. Upon failure, the error handling routines raise exceptions that include detailed information (for example, full module paths, attempted locations, and naming conventions).

**Step‑by‑step Trigger Scenario:**
1. An attacker crafts an HTTP POST request to the `/message` endpoint with a deliberately invalid component name (for example, `"test-message-module-not-loaded"` or a name containing unexpected characters such as dots).
2. The dynamic component loader attempts to resolve the module and class based on the provided name.
3. Because the component does not exist, an exception is raised (e.g., `ComponentModuleLoadError` or `ComponentClassLoadError`) that includes internal details.
4. If the application is deployed with `DEBUG=True` (or if errors are not appropriately masked in production), the detailed error message is returned to the attacker.

**Impact:**
Detailed error disclosures can provide an attacker with valuable information about the application’s internal structure, module paths, and class naming conventions. This information can facilitate further targeted attacks or reconnaissance.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- In production environments, Django’s error handling (with `DEBUG=False`) and custom error views are intended to obscure such details.
- Test cases indicate that detailed errors are raised only when misconfigured or during development.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- The dynamic component loader lacks comprehensive sanitization of error messages before they are returned to the client.
- There is no universal mechanism to generalize or mask internal exception details in error responses.

**Preconditions:**
- The application is deployed with unsafe configurations (for example, `DEBUG=True`) or lacks proper custom error handlers.
- The attacker must be able to influence the component name (via URL or payload) to trigger these errors.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. Within the view handling messages (commonly in `django_unicorn/views/message.py`), the supplied component name is used to dynamically load a module and its class.
2. When the module or class is not found, exceptions are raised that include attempted lookups and file path details.
3. These details are then returned in the HTTP response as part of the error message.

**Security Test Case (Step by Step):**
1. **Setup:**
   - Deploy the application in an environment with `DEBUG=True` or where detailed error messages are not suppressed.
2. **Craft Request:**
   - Use a tool such as curl or Postman to send an HTTP POST to the `/message` endpoint with an invalid or malformed component name.
3. **Observe:**
   - Capture the JSON response and verify that it includes sensitive internal details about module paths and attempted class names.
4. **Verification:**
   - Ensure that, in a production environment (with `DEBUG=False` and proper error handling), such internal details are not disclosed.

## 3. Arbitrary Module Import via Unsanitized Component Name

**Description:**
The framework performs dynamic module and class lookup for components based on a “component_name” parameter received from incoming HTTP requests. However, the input is not sufficiently sanitized or whitelisted. If an attacker submits a malicious or improperly formatted component name, it may be used to resolve module paths that fall outside the intended scope.

**Step‑by‑step Trigger Scenario:**
1. An attacker sends an HTTP POST request to the `/message` endpoint, including a crafted component name (such as one containing dots or dashes).
2. The component loader uses this name to build a module path (for example, appending the input to a base path like `"django_unicorn.components."`).
3. The unsanitized name may force the lookup of unexpected modules or classes that were never intended to be externally accessible.
4. If a malicious module is inadvertently imported—or if the error output reveals internal lookup details—it can lead to unintended behaviors or aid further exploitation.

**Impact:**
An attacker could force the dynamic import of modules not meant for public consumption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if further callable functionalities are invoked. Additionally, the error messages may leak internal structure data that helps map the application.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The framework restricts lookup paths using configuration settings (for example, limiting searches to specific modules under the `django_unicorn` umbrella through the UNICORN “APPS” setting).

**Missing Mitigations:**
- There is no explicit sanitization or whitelisting of the “component_name” input.
- The system does not perform a runtime type check to ensure that the imported class is indeed a valid, intended component.

**Preconditions:**
- An attacker must be able to send a POST request with an arbitrary or malformed “component_name”.
- The configuration (e.g., default settings) does not restrict dynamic lookup sufficiently.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In the module responsible for dynamic component resolution (for example, within `UnicornView.create()`), the supplied component name is used directly to calculate the module path.
2. The lack of rigorous input validation means that unexpected characters (like dots or dashes) can alter the expected lookup.
3. Test cases have confirmed that such inputs lead to exceptions that reveal internal module details.

**Security Test Case (Step by Step):**
1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure the application runs with default dynamic import settings without custom whitelisting.
2. **Craft Request:**
   - Send an HTTP POST request to `/message` with a manipulated component name (e.g., `"test.with.dot"`).
3. **Observation:**
   - Capture the error or behavior of the system. Verify that either an unintended module is accessed/executed or sensitive error details are disclosed.
4. **Verification:**
   - Confirm that a valid input sanitization or whitelist mechanism would have prevented this lookup.

## 4. Insecure Exposure of Sensitive Data via Default Model Serialization

**Description:**
When a Unicorn component binds to a Django model, the built‑in serializer automatically collects all public fields from the model and injects them into the rendered HTML output. If a developer does not explicitly exclude sensitive fields using configuration options (such as setting `Meta.javascript_exclude`), then private or confidential information (for example, password hashes or API keys) can be exposed to end users.

**Step‑by‑step Trigger Scenario:**
1. A developer creates a Unicorn component bound to a Django model containing sensitive fields.
2. The serializer (in `django_unicorn/serializer.py`) collects all model fields by default.
3. The rendered HTML includes these fields in a serialized state, making them viewable by anyone inspecting the client-side code.
4. An external attacker accesses the page and examines the HTML source code to retrieve sensitive data.

**Impact:**
Sensitive model data becomes directly accessible on the client side. This may lead to data leakage, further targeted attacks, or exposure of credential-like data that can be misused.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- Documentation and Meta options (such as `Meta.javascript_exclude`) advise developers to exclude sensitive fields from serialization.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- The serializer’s default behavior is unsafe because it serializes all model fields unless explicitly configured otherwise.
- A whitelist approach (only allowing specified fields) is not enforced by default.

**Preconditions:**
- A component is built with data-bound models that contain sensitive information.
- The developer has not configured exclusions for sensitive fields.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In the serializer, functions like `_get_model_dict()` iterate over `model._meta.fields` without filtering based on sensitivity.
2. The complete model state, including confidential fields, is then embedded into the rendered HTML output.

**Security Test Case (Step by Step):**
1. **Component Creation:**
   - Create a Unicorn component that binds to a Django model known to include sensitive data (e.g., a field named `secret_token`).
2. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the component without specifying any field exclusions.
3. **Observation:**
   - Open the page in a browser and inspect the HTML source code.
4. **Verification:**
   - Confirm that sensitive model data appears in the serialized component state.

## 5. Insecure Mass Assignment via Unrestricted Component State Updates

**Description:**
The framework synchronizes component state between the client and server by applying updates based on JSON payloads. By default, every public attribute of a component is eligible for update—even those not intended to be modified via client input. Without an explicit whitelist (or “safe” list) defined by the developer, an attacker who understands or can guess the component’s internal property names can craft a payload to assign dangerous or unauthorized values to critical component properties.

**Step‑by‑step Trigger Scenario:**
1. An attacker identifies or infers the names of public properties (for example, internal flags or business logic controls) in a component.
2. The attacker crafts a JSON payload that modifies these properties (such as setting a control flag to `True` or an internal counter to an abnormally high value).
3. An HTTP POST request is sent to the `/message` endpoint with the malicious payload.
4. The framework’s state update functions (such as `set_property_from_data()` or `set_property_value()`) blindly apply the incoming values to the component instance.

**Impact:**
Unauthorized modification of component state can allow bypassing of security checks, altering business logic, or even inducing privilege escalation. The integrity of the application is thereby compromised.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The framework offers an opt‑in mechanism where developers may define a list of “safe” properties that are allowed to change.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- By default, no safe‑list is applied; hence, all public attributes are writable.
- A secure default (using whitelisting or filtering based on property sensitivity) is not enforced.

**Preconditions:**
- The component is implemented without an explicit safe‑list.
- An attacker has the ability to send modified JSON payloads to the application’s public endpoints.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In the functions responsible for updating component state (namely, `set_property_from_data()` and `set_property_value()`), the property names and values from the incoming JSON are assigned directly to the component instance.
2. Test cases (e.g., ones that update nested properties such as “nested.check” or properties like “count”) illustrate that no restrictions are applied by default.

**Security Test Case (Step by Step):**
1. **Component Preparation:**
   - Use (or create) a component that does not restrict client‑side property updates via a safe‑list.
2. **Craft Payload:**
   - Construct an HTTP POST payload that assigns critical properties (for example, setting an internal control flag like `admin_mode=True` or modifying counters) to attacker‑controlled values.
3. **Send Request:**
   - Issue the POST request to the `/message` endpoint with the crafted payload.
4. **Observation:**
   - Verify on the server side that the component state was updated with the attacker‑supplied values.
5. **Verification:**
   - Confirm that subsequent component behavior reflects these unauthorized changes, demonstrating the vulnerability.

---

Each of these vulnerabilities arises when the application is deployed with default or misconfigured settings. Developers are strongly advised to:

- Adopt safer serialization methods and add integrity checks.
- Sanitize and whitelist sensitive inputs (such as component names and JSON state updates).
- Restrict the exposure of detailed error messages in production.
- Explicitly exclude sensitive model fields or, preferably, use a whitelist for model serialization.

Implementing these additional mitigations will strengthen the application’s security posture against external attackers targeting publicly available instances.
