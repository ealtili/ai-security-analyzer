Below is the updated list of vulnerabilities that meet the inclusion criteria (valid, not already mitigated, and with a rank of at least high). Each vulnerability is described in detail with all the supporting sections, assuming an external attacker targeting a publicly available instance of the application.

---

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Module Import via Unsanitized Component Name
  **Description:**
  • An attacker who can send an HTTP POST to the “/message” endpoint may supply a malicious or unexpected component name via the URL.
  • The framework uses the supplied “component_name” to perform dynamic module–and–class lookups without sufficient sanitization. For example, names containing dots (or even dashes that later get converted) can result in fallback locations such as “django_unicorn.components.test_with_dash”.
  • The tests (for example, those in `test_unicorn_view_init` and the message–handling tests in `test_message.py`) confirm that invalid or mis‐formatted component names trigger exceptions that expose internal module names.
  **Impact:**
  • An attacker may be able to force the dynamic import of unintended modules or classes.
  • This not only risks arbitrary code execution if callables are invoked with crafted parameters but can also expose internal structure details for further targeted attacks.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • The framework restricts lookup paths via the UNICORN “APPS” setting (by default limited to components under “django_unicorn”).
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Lack of explicit sanitization and whitelisting of the “component_name” input.
  • No runtime type check to validate that the imported class is an intended component subclass.
  **Preconditions:**
  • An attacker must be able to send a POST request to the public “/message” endpoint with an arbitrary (or specially malformed) “component_name”.
  • The UNICORN settings must be misconfigured—or left at the insecure default—so that the dynamic lookup is not sufficiently restricted.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  • In the module/class lookup (see functions called during component creation in `UnicornView` and related utility functions), the supplied “component_name” is used without rigorous checks.
  • When the name includes unexpected characters (e.g., dots or dashes), a fallback resolution generates module paths such as “django_unicorn.components.<malicious input>” that are then used to try to load a class.
  • The tests confirm that names like “test-with-dash” or “test.dot” lead to exceptions that reveal detailed information about module paths and expected class names.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Issue an HTTP POST to the “/message/{malicious_component_name}” endpoint (for example, using “test.with.dot” as the component name).
  2. Capture the JSON error response and verify that it includes internal module and attribute details generated from the input.
  3. Optionally, supply call parameters that force execution of the imported callable and observe if unexpected behavior or code execution occurs.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Information Disclosure via Detailed Component–Loading Error Messages
  **Description:**
  • When a component name cannot be resolved or the lookup fails, the dynamic loading code raises exceptions (for example, `ComponentClassLoadError` or `ComponentModuleLoadError`).
  • The detailed exception messages (which include full module paths, attempted class names, and even the underlying exception details) are returned in the JSON response to the client.
  • Tests such as those in `test_message_component_class_not_loaded` and related error–path tests confirm that these messages expose internal configuration details.
  **Impact:**
  • An attacker may learn internal details (such as module names, file paths, and naming conventions) which can be used to craft further targeted attacks.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • Custom exception types are used to wrap underlying errors, but the messages are not sanitized before being sent to the client.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Replace detailed error messages with generic text (while logging the details on the server–side) so that no internal details are disclosed to the client.
  **Preconditions:**
  • An attacker must be able to supply invalid or malicious component names, causing the lookup to fail and trigger detailed exceptions.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  • In `UnicornView.create()` (and related helper functions), when all module lookup attempts fail, the error message aggregates the attempted module/class names and the original exception messages.
  • This detailed information is then passed through to the JSON response by the error–handling decorator.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Send an HTTP POST request to “/message/invalid-component” (or another deliberately malformed component name).
  2. Verify that the JSON response contains detailed internal error information such as module paths and expected class names.
  3. Confirm that an attacker could use the revealed details to deduce internal structure.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unsafe Deserialization Using Pickle in the Caching Mechanism
  **Description:**
  • The caching mechanism (in `CacheableComponent` within `django_unicorn/cacher.py`) uses Python’s pickle to serialize and deserialize component instances including their full state.
  • If an attacker is able to inject or tamper with cache entries (for example, in a misconfigured or externally accessible cache backend), a malicious pickle payload could be deserialized via `pickle.loads`, triggering arbitrary code execution.
  **Impact:**
  • Successful exploitation could lead to full remote code execution on the host server, potentially compromising the entire system.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • The framework assumes that Django’s cache backend (often local–memory, Redis, or Memcache) is secured and not accessible to untrusted parties.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  • No safer serialization mechanism (such as JSON) is implemented for caching purposes.
  • Lack of additional isolation or validation of cache contents before deserialization, leaving the system at potential risk when the cache is exposed.
  **Preconditions:**
  • An attacker must have the ability to modify cache entries (e.g., through misconfigured cache access or another cache–related vulnerability in the environment).
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  • When a component is cached, its state is passed to `pickle.dumps` and later restored using `pickle.loads` without any pre–deserialization validation.
  • The absence of a signature or validation means that if a known cache key (for example, “unicorn:component:<id>”) is overwritten with a crafted payload, the deserialization process becomes exploitable.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. In a controlled environment, configure the application to use a cache backend that is accessible from outside (for example, a Redis instance with no authentication).
  2. Manually set a cache entry for a known Unicorn component key with a malicious pickle payload that executes arbitrary code.
  3. Issue an HTTP POST request to trigger a component state restoration (calling `restore_from_cache()`) and verify that the payload executes (for instance, by observing a side effect such as file creation).
  4. (Ensure this test is performed only in an isolated and controlled environment.)

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Exposure of Sensitive Data via Default Model Serialization
  **Description:**
  • When a Unicorn component is bound to a Django model, the serializer (in `django_unicorn/serializer.py`) automatically gathers all public model fields and injects them into the rendered HTML output.
  • If developers do not explicitly exclude sensitive fields (using configuration such as `Meta.javascript_exclude`), then private or confidential information (e.g., password hashes, API keys) may be exposed in the client–side HTML source.
  • Test files under `tests/serializer/` (for example, `test_simple_model()` and related tests) demonstrate that the default behavior is to serialize all fields unless exclusions are provided.
  **Impact:**
  • Sensitive model data becomes directly accessible from the client’s browser, increasing the risk of data leakage and targeted attacks against user accounts or critical application data.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • Developers are alerted (both through documentation and Meta options such as `Meta.javascript_exclude`) to explicitly exclude sensitive fields.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  • There is no safe–by–default approach; rather, all model fields are serialized unless manually excluded.
  • A more robust solution would be to whitelist only explicitly approved fields for frontend exposure.
  **Preconditions:**
  • A developer creates a Unicorn component that binds to a Django model containing sensitive data but does not configure any field–exclusion mechanism.
  • The affected page is publicly accessible, allowing an external attacker to inspect the full HTML source.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  • The `_get_model_dict()` function iterates over all fields in `model._meta.fields` and related many–to–many fields without filtering out sensitive content.
  • The serializer then dumps these values directly into the component’s state within the rendered HTML.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Create a Unicorn component that binds to a Django model instance known to contain a sensitive field (e.g., “secret_token”).
  2. Do not specify any exclusions via Meta options.
  3. Load the page in a browser and inspect the HTML source to confirm that the sensitive field’s value appears unmasked.
  4. Verify that the sensitive data is retrievable via a simple HTTP GET request.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Mass Assignment via Unrestricted Component State Updates
  **Description:**
  • The framework synchronizes component state between the client and server by applying updates from JSON data using helper functions such as `set_property_from_data()` and `set_property_value()`.
  • By default, every public attribute of a component is eligible for update—even those not intended to be modifiable from the client side.
  • An external attacker who understands (or can infer) the property names and hierarchy may craft a malicious payload that assigns dangerous or unauthorized values to sensitive component properties (for example, flags controlling business logic, access control settings, or internal counters).
  • Test cases under `tests/views/` (such as those updating nested properties like “nested.check” or using assignment operators in property names such as “count=2”) document that the framework applies these updates without any built–in safe–list check.
  **Impact:**
  • Unauthorized modification of component state may lead to bypassed security checks, altered business logic, or unintended behavior that could result in privilege escalation or leakage of sensitive processing data.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • The framework provides an opt–in mechanism for developers to restrict which properties are safe to update using a Meta option (for example, by explicitly listing “safe” properties in components such as `FakeComponentSafe`).
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  • In the absence of an explicit safe–list, the framework’s default behavior allows all public attributes to be updated from client–supplied data.
  • A more secure default would be to require developers to whitelist properties for client updates (or to employ exclusion based on naming conventions or type analysis for sensitive properties).
  **Preconditions:**
  • The component does not define a “safe” list (or an equivalent restriction) to limit which properties are modifiable.
  • An attacker is able to send a POST request to the “/message” endpoint with JSON data containing property–assignment expressions (e.g., “nested.check=True” or “count=999”).
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  • The functions `set_property_from_data()` and `set_property_value()` take property names and data coming in from the client dynamically and assign them directly to the component instance.
  • The test suite (e.g., `test_set_property_from_data_dict`, `test_set_property_from_data_nested_dict`) illustrates that there is no built–in check to verify if an attribute should be writable, meaning that by default all public properties are updated.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Create (or use) a component that does not restrict client–side updates through a Meta “safe” list.
  2. Send an HTTP POST request to the “/message” endpoint with a payload that sets one or more critical properties to attacker–controlled values (for example, updating an internal control flag like “admin_mode=True” or modifying “count=999”).
  3. Verify that the component state is updated on the server side according to the payload.
  4. Confirm that subsequent component actions reflect the attacker–modified state, thereby demonstrating the potential for unauthorized modifications.

---

Each of these vulnerabilities exists when the application is deployed with default or misconfigured settings and protective configuration options (such as input sanitization, error–message masking, explicit safe–lists for state updates, or secure caching practices) are not properly applied. Developers are advised to tighten input validation, enforce secure defaults for both serialization and state updates, and restrict dynamic module lookups to a narrow, trusted subset to mitigate these issues.
