Below is the updated list of valid, high‑risk vulnerabilities that could be externally exploited on a publicly available instance of the application:

---

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unauthenticated and Unprotected Code Generation Endpoint
  - **Description:**
    The WebSocket endpoint at `/generate-code` accepts connections without any authentication, authorization, or rate limiting. An external attacker can connect to this endpoint and supply arbitrary parameters (including unvalidated API keys and prompt histories) to trigger expensive LLM API calls. By automating rapid connections, the attacker can repeatedly invoke these operations to incur high financial costs and exhaust API quotas.
  - **Impact:**
    - Unauthorized use of costly LLM resources
    - Potential financial loss and disruption of service
    - Exhaustion of API call quotas, affecting legitimate users
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The endpoint accepts API key parameters from the client but does not perform additional authentication or enforcement.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement strict authentication (e.g., via API tokens or user sessions)
    - Enforce rate limiting and request throttling to avoid abuse
    - Add robust input validation and origin-checking on the WebSocket connections
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The application is deployed on a publicly accessible instance without additional access control
    - The attacker is capable of establishing a WebSocket connection to the endpoint
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `backend/routes/generate_code.py`, the decorator `@router.websocket("/generate-code")` unconditionally accepts incoming connections.
    - The function `extract_params` parses parameters (including API keys and prompt configuration) from received JSON without validating the client’s identity.
    - No rate limiting or authentication middleware is applied; hence an attacker can open multiple parallel connections.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    - Use a WebSocket testing tool (e.g., Postman’s WS client or a dedicated script) to connect to `ws://<host>:<port>/generate-code`.
    - Send a JSON payload with arbitrary parameters (for example, fake API keys and prompt history).
    - Rapidly send multiple requests and monitor responses for code “chunks” and status messages.
    - Confirm using server logs or API usage dashboards that multiple LLM calls occur without proper access control.

- **Vulnerability Name:** SSRF in Screenshot Endpoint
  - **Description:**
    The `/api/screenshot` endpoint accepts a user-supplied URL (via the `url` field in a JSON body) along with an API key. This URL is passed directly to the external service at `https://api.screenshotone.com/take` without proper sanitization or validation. An external attacker can supply a malicious or internal URL to force the external service to fetch data from private networks.
  - **Impact:**
    - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) targeting the external screenshot API
    - Disclosure of internal resources if the external service fails to filter internal addresses
    - Indirect leakage of information from internal endpoints
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Only a nonempty check on the URL is performed; no in-depth validation is applied.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Validate the URL to ensure it belongs to a list of approved external domains
    - Enforce a whitelist of safe URL patterns to prevent requests to internal addresses
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The endpoint is publicly accessible and accepts any URL value
    - The external service (screenshotone.com) can be exploited to fetch unintended internal content
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `backend/routes/screenshot.py`, the `ScreenshotRequest` model accepts a URL and API key without performing sanitization.
    - The function `capture_screenshot` passes the user-controlled URL directly into the query string for `https://api.screenshotone.com/take` without validation.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    - Create a POST request (using curl, Postman, etc.) to the `/api/screenshot` endpoint with a JSON body:
      ```json
      {
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1/admin",
        "apiKey": "dummy-key"
      }
      ```
    - Observe the response for a screenshot or error message and check for any behavior that indicates internal network access.
    - Repeat using other internal IP addresses and hostnames to confirm SSRF behavior.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Prompt Injection in Code Generation
  - **Description:**
    When creating the prompt for code generation, the application concatenates user-supplied history from the `history` parameter directly into the prompt messages without proper sanitization. An attacker can inject malicious content (for example, JavaScript or other directives), which might cause the LLM to generate code containing hidden script tags or other unintended behaviors.
  - **Impact:**
    - Generation of malicious HTML or JavaScript code
    - Possible cross-site scripting (XSS) if the generated code is later rendered
    - Supply-chain risks if generated code is deployed without thorough review
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - No sanitization is applied; functions like `create_prompt` and `assemble_prompt` in `prompts/__init__.py` pass raw history directly into the prompt.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Validate and sanitize all user-controlled input (especially the history array) before incorporating it into the prompt
    - Implement context isolation to ensure that injected content does not alter the intended prompt structure
  - **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker can control the `history` field in the client’s request to the `/generate-code` endpoint
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Within `backend/prompts/__init__.py`, the `create_prompt` function iterates over entries in `params["history"]` and appends them directly into the prompt messages.
    - No escaping, sanitization, or structural validation takes place for these history strings.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    - Connect to the `/generate-code` WebSocket endpoint using a testing tool.
    - Submit a request where the `history` parameter includes an injection payload such as:
      ```
      <script>alert('Injected!')</script>
      ```
    - Retrieve the generated code from the endpoint’s response (for example, through a “setCode” message).
    - Analyze the output code to determine if the injected script is present.
    - Optionally, load the generated code in an isolated browser environment to observe whether the script executes.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Disclosure via Unsanitized Eval Endpoints
  - **Description:**
    The eval-related endpoints (such as GET `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, and `/best-of-n-evals`) accept folder paths as query parameters, which are then used to construct file paths without proper input validation or sanitization. An attacker can supply arbitrary file system paths to cause the server to list or return HTML files from unintended directories, potentially exposing sensitive information or details about the server’s internal structure.
  - **Impact:**
    - Unauthorized disclosure of HTML files or other sensitive data from the server’s file system
    - Information leakage that can facilitate further attacks (e.g., aiding in path traversal or exposing sensitive configurations)
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The endpoints verify whether the provided folder exists but do not impose restrictions on allowed paths or sanitize the folder input.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Enforce strict validation or a whitelist of allowed folder paths
    - Sanitize inputs to prevent directory traversal (for example, by prohibiting sequences like “../”)
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The eval endpoints are publicly accessible
    - An attacker can supply arbitrary folder names as query parameters
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `backend/routes/evals.py`, the function `get_evals` directly converts the `folder` query parameter into a `Path` object and enumerates files within the directory.
    - Similar unsanitized logic is used in endpoints like `/pairwise-evals` and `/best-of-n-evals`, with no restrictions imposed on the folder value.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    - Use a tool such as Postman or curl to issue a GET request to `/evals?folder=../../../../../etc` (or another sensitive directory relative to the working directory).
    - Examine the response to see if the content of any unintended directory is revealed.
    - Verify that sensitive files or unexpected data are disclosed in the response.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Debug Logging Enabled in Production Environments
  - **Description:**
    The application can be configured with the debugging flag `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` set to True. When enabled, the `DebugFileWriter` writes full LLM responses and related artifacts to a directory specified by `DEBUG_DIR`. If this mode is mistakenly left enabled in production, the server may write sensitive data (including prompts, responses, and API usage details) to disk, which could be accessed by unauthorized parties.
  - **Impact:**
    - Leakage of sensitive information such as internal prompts, detailed execution responses, and possibly API keys
    - Exposure of business logic and debug artifacts that could assist further attacks
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Debug logging is governed by the `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` flag; if it is not enabled, no debug files are produced.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Enforce that `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` is strictly disabled in production environments
    - Apply strict access control and secure storage measures for any debug artifacts
    - Optionally sanitize or remove sensitive information before writing any debug log entries
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The production environment is misconfigured with `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` set to True
    - An attacker can either gain direct file system access or exploit misconfigured web server settings that allow enumeration of the debug directory
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `backend/debug/DebugFileWriter.py`, the constructor checks if `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` is True and creates a directory (using a UUID) without further security controls.
    - Subsequent debug output—including unmodified LLM responses—is written to files in this directory, which may not have restricted file permissions.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    - Verify the production environment’s configuration to check if `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` is enabled.
    - Attempt to access or list files within the directory specified by `DEBUG_DIR` (for example, by exploiting a misconfigured static file server).
    - Confirm that the debug files contain unsanitized, raw data such as full prompts and LLM responses that could disclose sensitive information.

Each of the above vulnerabilities is valid (has a high risk ranking) and is not currently fully mitigated, thereby requiring prompt attention to improve sanitization, access control, and input validation for the publicly deployed instance of the application.
