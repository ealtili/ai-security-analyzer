Below is the updated list of vulnerabilities. Based on the instructions—assuming that an external attacker targets a publicly available instance—the dynamic component loading issue is considered mitigated in production (via standard Django practices such as disabling detailed errors with `DEBUG=False`). Therefore, only vulnerabilities that are inherent in the project and not already mitigated are included. In this case, the **Unsafe Pickle Deserialization in Component Caching Mechanism** (ranked Critical) remains.

## Unsafe Pickle Deserialization in Component Caching Mechanism

**Description:**
The framework caches entire component trees (including parents and children) using Python’s built‑in pickle module (see the `CacheableComponent` class and the functions `cache_full_tree` and `restore_from_cache` in `django_unicorn/cacher.py`). While using Django’s caching system is common, this implementation relies on pickle serialization without any added integrity checks. If the cache backend is misconfigured or exposed to an external attacker (for example, if using a Redis or Memcached instance that is not secured by strong access controls), an attacker may be able to manipulate or “poison” the cache with a malicious pickle payload. When the framework later retrieves and deserializes the component using `pickle.loads`, arbitrary code execution (RCE) can result.

**Impact:**
An attacker who manages to inject or modify the cache data could achieve remote code execution on the server. This may result in full system compromise, data exfiltration, lateral movement, and complete loss of service integrity.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The framework leverages Django’s built‑in caching framework. In environments where the cache backend is properly secured (e.g. using a local in‑memory cache or a Redis/Memcached instance restricted to internal networks), the risk is somewhat reduced.
- Administrators can configure which cache alias is used via settings (using the `UNICORN["CACHE_ALIAS"]` setting).

**Missing Mitigations:**
- No explicit integrity verification or signing is performed on the pickled data.
- There is no fallback to a safer serialization format (such as JSON) for scenarios when the cache backend might be exposed.
- The framework does not enforce that the underlying cache store is completely isolated from untrusted networks.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must be able to reach and write to the cache backend (for example, due to misconfigured network exposure or weak/no authentication on Redis/Memcached).
- The attacker must be able to determine or guess cache keys for cached component trees.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In **`django_unicorn/cacher.py`**:
  - When caching the component tree, each component is pickled via `pickle.dumps(component)` without any additional security wrapper.
  - Later, the retrieved cached blob is deserialized using `pickle.loads(cached_component)`, with no verification of integrity or origin.
  - This design means that if an attacker can write to the cache, a malicious pickle payload could lead to arbitrary code execution when deserialized.

**Security Test Case (Step by Step):**
1. **Setup a Test Environment:**
   - Configure the Django application to use a cache backend (e.g. Redis or Memcached) that is intentionally exposed with weak or no authentication.
   - Ensure that the `UNICORN["CACHE_ALIAS"]` setting points to this insecure cache.
2. **Craft a Malicious Payload:**
   - Create a malicious pickle payload that, when deserialized, executes an arbitrary command (for example, creating a file, writing to disk, or spawning a shell).
3. **Inject into the Cache:**
   - Determine the cache key format (e.g. “unicorn:component:<component_id>”) and use a cache client to write the malicious pickle payload directly into the cache for that key.
4. **Trigger Restoration:**
   - Issue an HTTP POST request to the unicorn message endpoint (e.g. `/unicorn/message`) that causes the framework to load the affected component from cache.
5. **Verify Exploitation:**
   - Confirm that the malicious payload executed its intended effect (for example, by checking for the creation of a file or other side effect).
6. **Cleanup:**
   - Remove the malicious cache entry and restore secure cache configuration.
