## Vulnerability 1: Arbitrary PHP Command Execution via Misconfigured `phpCommand` Setting

**Description:**
1. The extension reads the user’s workspace configuration for `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` (see in *helpers.ts* in the `runPhp` method).
2. An attacker who has control over the workspace (for example, by providing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json`) can modify this setting to a command string that not only runs PHP code but also appends additional malicious shell commands.
3. When the extension calls `Helpers.runPhp()`, it substitutes the `{code}` placeholder with PHP code that is automatically generated for autocompletion.
4. Because the command string is not validated or properly isolated, the entire command (including any extra attacker-supplied shell instructions) gets executed in the user’s shell.
5. The attacker’s malicious payload (for example, a command to create or modify system files) is thereby executed on the victim’s machine without any further user intervention.

**Impact:**
- Full arbitrary command execution on the victim’s system.
- Potential compromise of sensitive data, persistent backdoors, or further lateral movement.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The extension simply reads the configuration setting and uses Node’s `cp.exec` to run the command.
- No built‐in input validation or sanitization of the `phpCommand` configuration is applied before substitution.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Validation and sanitization of the configured command template input.
- Use of secure execution methods (e.g. parameterized API calls or sandboxed environments) instead of directly substituting user–supplied strings into shell commands.
- Prompting the user or warning when a non–default command template is detected.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must be able to control or pre-populate a malicious workspace configuration (for instance by delivering a compromised repository containing a custom `.vscode/settings.json`).
- The victim must open this workspace so that the extension reads and later executes the modified `phpCommand` setting.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `helpers.ts` within the `runPhp` function, the following code is used:
  ```js
  let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
  let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);
  cp.exec(command, { cwd: /* workspace directory */ }, function (err, stdout, stderr) { ... });
  ```
- There is no sanitization of the value returned by the configuration. Any malicious addition in the template (for example, appending `&& rm -rf /important/path`) will be executed in addition to the intended PHP code.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Create a new workspace and include a `.vscode/settings.json` file with the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}\" && echo 'MALICIOUS CODE EXECUTED' && touch /tmp/hacked"
   }
   ```
2. Open the workspace in VSCode so that the extension starts its periodic autocompletion PHP execution.
3. Observe (via terminal logs or manually checking) that the command output indicates execution of the malicious payload (e.g. the file `/tmp/hacked` is created).
4. Confirm that arbitrary command execution occurs as a direct result of the modified `phpCommand` setting.

## Vulnerability 2: Arbitrary PHP Code Execution via Malicious Laravel Project Bootstrapping

**Description:**
1. To obtain the autocompletion data, the extension automatically boots the Laravel application by invoking the Laravel bootstrap files. This is done in the `Helpers.runLaravel` method.
2. The method builds a command string that first requires the project’s `vendor/autoload.php` and `bootstrap/app.php` files.
3. An attacker can craft a malicious Laravel project (or even subtly modify an existing one) by embedding attacker-controlled PHP code in service providers or other bootstrapping files.
4. When the extension automatically executes this command to generate autocomplete data, the compromised bootstrap phase is executed.
5. As a result, the malicious PHP code (for example, code embedded in a service provider registering itself during boot or in the project's custom providers) gets executed on the victim’s machine.

**Impact:**
- Full arbitrary PHP code execution.
- Potential for system compromise, sensitive data disclosure, and installation of persistent threats.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The README contains a “Security Note” advising users to disable the extension when writing sensitive code in service providers; however, this is only advisory.
- There is no technical sandboxing or isolation of the Laravel bootstrap execution within the extension’s code.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Isolation or sandboxing of the PHP environment in which the Laravel application is bootstrapped.
- Verification or integrity checks on the Laravel project’s bootstrap files to ensure no attacker-injected code is executed without explicit user consent.
- User confirmation prior to auto–executing PHP code from the project when bootstrapping the Laravel application.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must be able to force the victim to open a Laravel project that includes maliciously crafted bootstrap code (e.g. through supplying a compromised project repository or injecting code into a CI/CD pipeline).
- The extension must be enabled and configured to periodically run the bootstrap process (as it does by default) so that the malicious code is executed automatically.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `Helpers.runLaravel` the following steps occur:
  - The function checks for the existence of `vendor/autoload.php` and `bootstrap/app.php`.
  - It then builds a PHP command string that includes:
    ```php
    require_once '<project_path>/vendor/autoload.php';
    $app = require_once '<project_path>/bootstrap/app.php';
    // Registers a dummy service provider for the extension’s purposes
    $app->register(new VscodeLaravelExtraIntellisenseProvider($app));
    $kernel = $app->make(Illuminate\Contracts\Console\Kernel::class);
    $status = $kernel->handle(...);
    // Executes the user–supplied code for autocompletion purposes
    echo '___VSCODE_LARAVEL_EXTRA_INSTELLISENSE_OUTPUT___'; echo {code}; echo '___VSCODE_LARAVEL_EXTRA_INSTELLISENSE_END_OUTPUT___';
    ```
- Since the Laravel bootstrap process runs all registered service providers (as well as other bootstrapping tasks), any attacker-controlled PHP code within these files is executed without further user mediation.
- There is no sandboxing, and no integrity check is performed on the files being loaded, so malicious changes in the Laravel project will automatically be trusted and executed at runtime.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Set up a Laravel project that includes a malicious service provider (for example, a file in `app/Providers/MaliciousServiceProvider.php` with a `boot` method that executes `system("touch /tmp/hacked")`). Ensure this provider is registered (either via `config/app.php` or via a dynamic autoloading mechanism).
2. Open this malicious Laravel project in VSCode so that the extension detects the Laravel project and starts executing the bootstrap process using `Helpers.runLaravel`.
3. Monitor the system (for instance, by checking for the creation of the file `/tmp/hacked`) to verify that the malicious code was executed as part of the auto-bootstrapping process.
4. Confirm that the extension’s process of generating autocomplete data results in arbitrary PHP code execution due to the malicious project code.
