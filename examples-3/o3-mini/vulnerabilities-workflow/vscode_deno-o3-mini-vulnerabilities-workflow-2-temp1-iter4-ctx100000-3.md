1. **Vulnerability Name:** Malicious Import Map Vulnerability
   **Description:**
   An attacker can craft a workspace where the Deno configuration (for example, via a custom import map file set in the `"deno.importMap"` setting) remaps well‑known module specifiers to URLs under the attacker’s control. When the extension invokes commands (such as “Deno: Cache” or “Deno: Test”) it simply reads the import map value and passes it directly (after a simple trim) to the Deno CLI. This can result in remote module resolution fetching attacker‑provided code.
   **Impact:**
   If the cached remote module is later executed by Deno (or if its contents are used by the language server), this can lead to remote code execution in the victim’s development environment.
   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
   - The extension simply documents the use of import maps and expects the user to have a correct configuration.
   **Missing Mitigations:**
   - There is no runtime validation or sanitization of the import map value. For example, the extension does not verify that the mapped URL comes from a trusted domain or prompt the user before fetching remote content.
   **Preconditions:**
   - The attacker must supply or modify workspace configuration files (for example, a `deno.json` and an accompanying import map file) and the victim must open that workspace with Deno enabled.
   **Source Code Analysis:**
   - In the `test` command (see _client/src/commands.ts_), the extension retrieves the configuration using:
     ```ts
     const importMap: string | undefined | null = config.get("importMap");
     ```
     and then, if defined and non‑empty, it does:
     ```ts
     if (importMap?.trim()) {
       testArgs.push("--import-map", importMap.trim());
     }
     ```
     This value is then passed as an argument to the spawned Deno process. There is no check to ensure that the URL or file path is “safe.”
   **Security Test Case:**
   1. Prepare a workspace with a custom `deno.json` file that sets `"deno.importMap": "./malicious_import_map.json"`.
   2. Create the file `malicious_import_map.json` so that a well‑known module specifier (for example, `"https://deno.land/std/"`) is remapped to `https://attacker.com/malicious.js`.
   3. Open the workspace in VS Code with Deno enabled.
   4. Trigger a Deno command (for example, using “Deno: Cache” or “Deno: Test”).
   5. Verify (for example, via network logs) that the Deno CLI fetches from `https://attacker.com/malicious.js` and that, if executed later, the module’s attacker‑provided payload is run.

2. **Vulnerability Name:** Malicious Deno Path Configuration Vulnerability
   **Description:**
   The extension lets workspaces set a custom `"deno.path"` so that the path to the Deno executable is overridden. An attacker who supplies a workspace or user‑level config file with a malicious value—for example, a relative or absolute path pointing to an attacker‑controlled executable—can make the extension launch that executable whenever it starts the language server or spawns a Deno task.
   **Impact:**
   This may result in arbitrary code execution on the victim’s machine (for example, running malicious code when the language server is restarted).
   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
   - The extension uses the setting directly via
     ```ts
     const command = await getDenoCommandPath();
     ```
     (see _client/src/commands.ts_ and _client/src/util.ts_) without any validation.
   **Missing Mitigations:**
   - There is no check to ensure the supplied path actually points to a trusted and valid Deno executable. Additional validation (for example, requiring an absolute path, verifying against a whitelist or digital signature, or prompting the user if the path is unusual) is missing.
   **Preconditions:**
   - The attacker must be able to supply or replace the workspace’s configuration (for example, in a shared repository) and the victim must open that workspace.
   **Source Code Analysis:**
   - In the function `startLanguageServer` (in _client/src/commands.ts_), the code calls:
     ```ts
     const command = await getDenoCommandPath();
     ```
     which in turn reads the setting via:
     ```ts
     const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string>("path");
     ```
     and then uses that value directly as the command for spawning a process. There is no sanitization or verification of this path.
   **Security Test Case:**
   1. Create a malicious workspace configuration file (for example, `.vscode/settings.json`) with the key `"deno.path": "<path-to-malicious-executable>"`.
   2. Ensure that the malicious executable performs an obvious action (for testing purposes, it could simply write a file or display an alert).
   3. Open the workspace in VS Code.
   4. Trigger a Deno-based command (such as “Deno: Enable” which starts the language server).
   5. Verify that the malicious executable is launched by checking for the side effect (e.g. file creation or log messages).

3. **Vulnerability Name:** Lack of Import URL Sanitization Leading to Command Injection
   **Description:**
   In certain commands (for example, the “test” command), the extension reads configuration values like `"deno.importMap"` and directly assembles command‑line arguments to pass to spawned Deno processes. If an attacker is able to supply a payload in these settings (for example, by embedding extra flags or unexpected content), the arguments may be interpreted in an unintended way.
   **Impact:**
   This can lead to command injection and the execution of arbitrary commands on the developer’s system.
   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
   - The extension currently performs only a basic string trim on the configuration value (see _client/src/commands.ts_ in the test command).
   **Missing Mitigations:**
   - No validation is performed to ensure that the supplied `"deno.importMap"` (or similar values) is simply a file path or URL. A strict whitelist or parsing that confirms the value’s format is missing.
   **Preconditions:**
   - The attacker must be able to supply or modify the workspace configuration so that the import map (or another parameter) contains injected command‑line content.
   **Source Code Analysis:**
   - In the `test` function (in _client/src/commands.ts_), the code does:
     ```ts
     const importMap: string | undefined | null = config.get("importMap");
     if (importMap?.trim()) {
       testArgs.push("--import-map", importMap.trim());
     }
     ```
     There is no check to prevent an attacker from embedding extra command switches or malicious payloads in `importMap`. That argument is later handed directly to the Deno CLI.
   **Security Test Case:**
   1. Prepare a workspace configuration in which `"deno.importMap"` is set to a string that includes extra command‑line arguments (for example, `"./legit_import_map.json --malicious-flag"`).
   2. Open the workspace in VS Code and trigger the “Deno: Test” command.
   3. Monitor the spawned process’s arguments (or its behavior) to verify that the additional payload has been passed and executed.
