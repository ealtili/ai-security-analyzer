- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Resolution of the Deno Executable Path
  **Description:**
  The extension looks up the path to the Deno CLI using the workspace configuration setting (via the key `deno.path`). When this setting is provided, its value is used verbatim (if absolute) or resolved relative to the workspace folder. An attacker controlling the workspace configuration file (for example, via a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` or `deno.json`) can supply a path that points to a malicious executable. When the extension starts the language server (by calling functions like `getDenoCommandPath()` in `client/src/util.ts` and then invoking that command in `startLanguageServer()`), the unvalidated executable is executed without any authenticity check.

  **Impact:**
  The untrusted executable may run arbitrary code on the developer’s machine, leading to full system compromise including arbitrary command execution and data exfiltration.

  **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - When a relative path is provided it is resolved against the workspace folder.
  - A try/catch block exists to log errors if the path is not found.

  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - There is no validation that the resolved path indeed points to a trustworthy Deno executable.
  - No integrity check or user confirmation is performed if a nonstandard (or absolute) path is specified.
  - A whitelist or signature verification of the binary is missing.

  **Preconditions:**
  - An attacker must be able to supply or modify a workspace configuration file (such as through a compromised repository or deliberate misconfiguration) to set `deno.path` to an attacker–controlled executable.
  - The affected workspace is opened in VS Code while the extension is enabled.

  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `client/src/commands.ts`, the `startLanguageServer()` function calls `getDenoCommandPath()`.
  - In `client/src/util.ts` the function `getDenoCommandPath()` retrieves the configured value using
    ```ts
    const command = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string>("path");
    ```
    If the command is absolute it is returned immediately with no further checks; if not absolute it is resolved relative to the workspace folder.
  - There is no subsequent validation that the returned command is indeed the genuine Deno executable.

  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Create a workspace with a custom VS Code settings file (for example, in `.vscode/settings.json`) that sets
     ```json
     {
       "deno.path": "/path/to/malicious_executable"
     }
     ```
  2. Place a stand‐in (or actually malicious) executable at the specified location which—for testing purposes—logs its invocation or writes to disk.
  3. Open the workspace in VS Code with the extension enabled.
  4. Observe (for example, via logging or system process inspection) that the extension launches the executable at `/path/to/malicious_executable` rather than a trusted Deno binary.
  5. This confirms that an attacker–supplied configuration leads to execution of untrusted code.
