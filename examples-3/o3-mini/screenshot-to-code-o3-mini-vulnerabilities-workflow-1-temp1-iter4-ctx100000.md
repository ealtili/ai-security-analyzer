## 1. Unauthenticated and Unprotected Code Generation WebSocket Endpoint

**Description:**
The WebSocket endpoint at `/generate-code` is accessible without any authentication, authorization, or rate limiting. An attacker can initiate a connection from any WebSocket client and supply arbitrary JSON parameters—including unsanitized API keys and prompt histories—to trigger expensive LLM API calls. The absence of authentication allows attackers to send rapid, repeated requests. In some configurations, unrestricted Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) (using `allow_origins=["*"]`) further exacerbates the risk by permitting malicious webpages to forge requests.
*Steps to trigger:*
1. Connect to `ws://<host>:<port>/generate-code` using a readily available WebSocket client (like wscat, Postman, or a custom script).
2. Send a JSON payload with arbitrary and/or fake API keys and prompt history data.
3. Automate multiple rapid connections to repeatedly trigger back‑end calls to expensive LLMs.

**Impact:**
- Unauthorized use of the AI code generation service.
- Significant financial loss from expensive LLM model invocations.
- Exhaustion of API quotas, leading to service degradation for legitimate users.
- Exposure of sensitive client-supplied data (e.g., API keys) via uncontrolled requests.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The endpoint accepts API key parameters from the client.
- A CORS policy configured with `allow_origins=["*"]` is in place, though it provides no real access control.
- The connection is immediately accepted without any authentication or origin checks.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Implementation of strict authentication (e.g., API tokens, session-based authentication) on the WebSocket endpoint.
- Enforcement of rate limiting and abuse detection to block rapid repeat connections.
- Input validation and sanitization of client-supplied parameters.
- Restricting allowed origins in the CORS configuration to trusted domains only.

**Preconditions:**
- The application is deployed publicly with the `/generate-code` endpoint accessible over the network.
- The attacker can open WebSocket connections to this endpoint.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `backend/routes/generate_code.py`, the endpoint is defined using `@router.websocket("/generate-code")` and immediately accepts the connection with `await websocket.accept()`.
2. The function `extract_params` parses the incoming JSON with minimal or no input validation.
3. No middleware for authentication or rate limiting is applied on this route.
4. Additional error functions (such as one that sends detailed stack traces) may reveal internal details under error conditions.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Connect to the `/generate-code` endpoint using a WebSocket client (such as wscat).
2. Send a valid JSON request including fake API keys and prompt history.
3. Automate the connection and observe that the server processes multiple concurrent requests without any authentication or rate limiting.
4. Verify from server logs or API usage dashboards that an excessive number of LLM calls are triggered.

## 2. Server‑Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Screenshot Endpoint

**Description:**
The `/api/screenshot` endpoint accepts a JSON payload that includes a `url` field and an API key, then passes the user‑supplied URL directly as a parameter to an external service (`https://api.screenshotone.com/take`) without proper validation. An attacker can supply a malicious URL—such as one pointing to internal services (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1/admin`)—to force the external service (or even the backend) to access unintended targets.
*Steps to trigger:*
1. Send a POST request with a JSON payload, for example:
   ```json
   {
     "url": "http://127.0.0.1/admin",
     "apiKey": "dummy-key"
   }
   ```
2. Because the backend does not validate the URL, the external API receives the malicious URL.
3. Through this mechanism, internal network resources can be probed.

**Impact:**
- Unauthorized internal requests may be generated, leading to disclosure of internal resources.
- Facilitates internal network reconnaissance if private IP addresses or local endpoints are accessed.
- Potential for further escalation if sensitive data from internal endpoints are returned.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- A basic non‑empty check on the URL is performed.
- The backend merely forwards the user input to the third‑party screenshot service without further validation.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Robust validation of the URL including a whitelist of allowed hostnames.
- Blocking or filtering of URLs that resolve to internal or private IP addresses.
- Additional network-level egress filtering to restrict outbound requests.

**Preconditions:**
- The endpoint is publicly accessible.
- The attacker can submit arbitrary URLs along with an API key in the request payload.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `backend/routes/screenshot.py`, the `ScreenshotRequest` Pydantic model captures the `url` field.
2. The `capture_screenshot` function builds a parameters dictionary that includes the unsanitized user-supplied URL.
3. This URL is then directly embedded in the query string for a request to the external API (`https://api.screenshotone.com/take`), making SSRF possible.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Use Postman or curl to send a POST request to `/api/screenshot` with the payload:
   ```json
   {
     "url": "http://127.0.0.1/admin",
     "apiKey": "dummy-key"
   }
   ```
2. Monitor whether the backend or external service attempts to access the internal URL.
3. Verify through server logs or network monitoring that an internal address is used, confirming SSRF.

## 3. Prompt Injection in Code Generation

**Description:**
When building prompts for AI code generation, the application directly concatenates user-supplied content (from the `history` parameter) into the prompt without any sanitization. An attacker can inject malicious content (for example, `<script>alert('Injected!')</script>`) that influences the LLM’s output. This could result in the LLM generating malicious HTML or JavaScript code.
*Steps to trigger:*
1. Connect to the `/generate-code` endpoint via a WebSocket client.
2. Send a JSON payload that includes a `history` parameter containing an injection payload such as `<script>alert('Injected!')</script>`.
3. The server constructs the prompt using unsanitized history data, and the LLM generates code incorporating the malicious input.

**Impact:**
- The generated code may include injected scripts leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if rendered by a browser.
- Such script injections can hijack sessions, deface websites, or exfiltrate user data.
- It undermines the trust in automated code generation processes.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- There is no sanitization applied in the functions (e.g., `create_prompt` or `assemble_prompt` in `backend/prompts/__init__.py`).
- User-supplied history is directly concatenated into the prompt.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Validate and sanitize all user-controlled input prior to inserting it into the prompt.
- Use output encoding or a secure templating engine to isolate control data from user data.
- Introduce context-based filtering to remove hazardous HTML or script tags from user input.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must control the `history` field within the payload sent to `/generate-code`.
- The prompt construction process must use unsanitized user input.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `backend/prompts/__init__.py`, the `create_prompt` function iterates through `params["history"]` and appends each entry directly to the prompt string.
2. No escaping or filtering takes place, making the function vulnerable to injection if harmful input is provided.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Connect to the `/generate-code` endpoint with a WebSocket client.
2. Send a payload with a `history` parameter containing:
   ```
   <script>alert('Injected!')</script>
   ```
3. Retrieve the generated code and inspect whether the injected content appears in the output.
4. Optionally, load the output in a secure browser environment to determine whether the script executes.

## 4. Arbitrary File Disclosure and Directory Traversal in Evaluation Endpoints

**Description:**
Evaluation endpoints such as `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, and `/best-of-n-evals` accept a folder path as a query parameter and subsequently use it to enumerate and read HTML files. The folder parameter is not properly sanitized, enabling an attacker to inject relative paths (e.g., using `../../`) to traverse directories and access files beyond intended boundaries.
*Steps to trigger:*
1. Send a GET request to an evaluation endpoint (for instance, `/evals`) with a query parameter like `?folder=../../etc`.
2. The application converts the user-supplied folder path directly into a filesystem path without sanitizing sequences such as `../`.
3. If the folder exists or if the check passes, the server lists and/or returns files from that location.

**Impact:**
- Exposure of sensitive files such as internal HTML, configuration files, or evaluation artifacts.
- Disclosure of internal server directory structure that can aid further attacks.
- Potential leakage of proprietary or confidential information.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The code performs a basic existence check on the provided folder using `Path(folder).exists()`.
- Some endpoints filter for files ending with “.html” only.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Robust input validation that restricts folder paths to known, safe subdirectories.
- Implementation of a whitelist or canonicalization method to prevent directory traversal.
- Appropriate authorization checks to ensure only allowed users can access file listings.

**Preconditions:**
- The evaluation endpoints are publicly accessible and accept any folder name via query parameters.
- The application does not enforce strict sanitization of directory inputs.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `backend/routes/evals.py`, the folder parameter is directly converted into a `Path` object.
2. Functions such as `os.listdir` then enumerate files based on this unsanitized input.
3. The lack of a whitelist or proper path cleaning enables the traversal attack using sequences like `../`.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Use a tool (curl, Postman, etc.) to issue a GET request to `/evals?folder=../../etc`.
2. Examine the response for a list of files or file contents that originate from directories outside the permitted scope.
3. Verify that sensitive or internal files are disclosed, confirming the vulnerability.

## 5. Debug Logging Enabled in Production Environments

**Description:**
When the `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` flag is set to True, the application writes full LLM responses and related debug artifacts—including internal prompts, API keys, and execution details—to a file system directory (as specified by `DEBUG_DIR`). If enabled in production by mistake, these logs may expose highly sensitive information that can be accessed by unauthorized parties.
*Steps to trigger:*
1. In a production environment with misconfiguration (i.e., `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` is True), the application routinely writes detailed logs.
2. An attacker with access to the server filesystem (or via a misconfigured static file server) can enumerate and read files in the debug logging directory.

**Impact:**
- Exposure of sensitive operational details including full LLM responses, API keys, and internal prompts.
- Leakage of proprietary logic and configuration details that may facilitate further attacks.
- Increased risk of subsequent targeted exploits based on the detailed debug information.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- Debug logging is controlled by the `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` flag, and when properly disabled in production, no logs are created.
- Logs are written only if the flag is enabled.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Enforce that `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` is disabled in production at all times.
- Apply strict access control and permissions to any debug directories and files created.
- Sanitize or remove sensitive information before logging detailed responses.

**Preconditions:**
- The production environment is misconfigured with debugging enabled.
- An attacker is able to access the file system or debug directory due to weak file permissions or exposed static paths.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `backend/debug/DebugFileWriter.py`, the constructor checks the `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` flag and creates a debug directory (often with a generated UUID) when enabled.
2. LLM responses and full debug artifacts are written directly to files within this directory.
3. No sanitization or additional access restriction is enforced on these debug files.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Verify the production configuration to check if `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` is erroneously set to True.
2. Attempt to access the directory specified by `DEBUG_DIR` (for example, via a web request if static directories are misconfigured).
3. Examine the debug files for sensitive data such as API keys or full LLM responses.
4. Confirm that the environment is vulnerable to data disclosure via debug logs.

## 6. Information Disclosure via Detailed Error Messages over the Code Generation WebSocket

**Description:**
When an error occurs on the `/generate-code` WebSocket endpoint, the error handler (such as the `throw_error` function) sends detailed error messages—including internal exception details, stack traces, and file paths—back to the client. An attacker can deliberately submit malformed or unexpected payloads to trigger such errors and then capture excessive internal information.
*Steps to trigger:*
1. Establish a connection to the `/generate-code` WebSocket endpoint.
2. Send a deliberately malformed or invalid payload to trigger an exception.
3. Observe that the error handler returns detailed error messages including stack traces and internal file paths.

**Impact:**
- Provides attackers with sensitive internal details that can be used to better understand the application’s architecture.
- Reveals configuration details, internal file structure, and possibly sensitive debugging data that can aid in further exploitation.
- Increases the risk of additional, targeted vulnerabilities being discovered and exploited.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The error handling mechanism closes the WebSocket connection immediately after sending the error details.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Sanitize error messages to provide only generic error information to the client.
- Log full error details securely on the server without exposing them to external users.
- Implement a mechanism to strip sensitive details (stack traces, internal paths, etc.) from error messages before they are transmitted.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must be able to connect to the `/generate-code` endpoint and send malformed payloads.
- The error handler does not sanitize error outputs.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `backend/routes/generate_code.py`, when an exception is caught, the `throw_error` function is invoked.
2. This function sends the complete error message, including stack traces and internal file references, to the client over the WebSocket.
3. The connection is then terminated, but not before detailed internal information is disclosed.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Connect to the `/generate-code` WebSocket endpoint using a testing client.
2. Send intentionally malformed JSON to trigger an error.
3. Capture the error response and examine whether it includes detailed internal information such as stack traces or file paths.
4. Confirm that the error disclosure can aid an attacker in mapping the internal structure.

## 7. Lack of Output Sanitization Enabling Potential XSS in LLM‑Generated Code

**Description:**
The application returns LLM-generated HTML code to the client without robust sanitization. If an attacker is able to influence the input (for example, via unsanitized prompt injection), the LLM may output HTML that contains malicious JavaScript or other executable content. Since this output is rendered in the client’s browser without further filtering, it raises the risk of cross‑site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*Steps to trigger:*
1. Connect to the `/generate-code` endpoint and send a payload with a `history` element containing an injection payload (e.g., `<script>alert('Injected!')</script>`).
2. Allow the LLM to process the input and generate code containing the injected script.
3. The generated HTML is subsequently returned to the client and rendered in the browser.

**Impact:**
- Execution of attacker-controlled scripts in the end user’s browser.
- Risks of session hijacking, data exfiltration, website defacement, and further injection attacks.
- Compromises the integrity of the code generation process and client security.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- A basic extraction or regex-based mechanism (such as using `extract_html_content`) is employed to process LLM outputs, but it does not adequately sanitize dangerous tags.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Robust output sanitization that strips or escapes dangerous HTML tags and attributes before delivery to the client.
- Implementation of a Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit script execution in the browser.
- Usage of a well‑established HTML sanitization library to thoroughly clean the generated content.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker can influence input parameters (e.g., prompt history) that shape the LLM’s output.
- The generated output is later rendered by a browser without further filtering.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. The code generation pipeline calls LLMs to produce HTML code, which is then passed through functions like `extract_html_content`.
2. These functions rely on simple regex extractions that are insufficient to remove embedded `<script>` tags or other executable code.
3. As a result, any malicious content injected into the prompt may be present and active in the delivered HTML.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Use a WebSocket client to connect to `/generate-code` and send a payload with a `history` parameter such as:
   ```
   <script>alert('Injected!')</script>
   ```
2. Retrieve the generated HTML code output.
3. Open the output in an isolated browser environment and observe whether the injected script executes.
4. Confirm that the output sanitization is inadequate and that XSS is possible.
