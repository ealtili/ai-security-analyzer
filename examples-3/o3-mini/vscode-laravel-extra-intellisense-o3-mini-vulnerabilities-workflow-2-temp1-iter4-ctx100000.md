## 1. Arbitrary PHP Command Execution via Misconfigured/Configurable `phpCommand` Setting

**Description:**
The extension retrieves a user-configurable PHP command template from the setting `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` (which by default is set to `php -r "{code}"`). In the helper function `runPhp`, the extension replaces the `{code}` placeholder with dynamically generated PHP code (used for features like autocompletion) and then executes the resulting command using Node’s `cp.exec()`. Since the command string is constructed by simple string replacement with very limited escaping (e.g. handling double quotes and, on Unix, dollar signs), an attacker who can control or supply a malicious workspace configuration (for instance via a compromised `.vscode/settings.json`) may modify this configuration value to inject additional shell commands. In the absence of robust input validation or proper isolation, the entire command—including any appended malicious shell instructions—is executed in the user’s shell, leading to full arbitrary command execution.

**Step-by-Step Trigger Scenario:**
1. The extension reads the workspace configuration for `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand`.
2. An attacker provides a malicious configuration (for example, via a tampered `.vscode/settings.json`) that modifies the command template to include extra shell commands.
3. When the extension calls `Helpers.runPhp`, it performs a simple replacement of the `{code}` placeholder without proper sanitization.
4. The resulting command (with the attacker’s appendages) is executed using `cp.exec()`, triggering the malicious payload.

**Impact:**
- **Full Arbitrary Command Execution:** The attacker’s shell commands are executed on the victim’s machine.
- **System Compromise:** Potential leakage of sensitive data, file system modifications, installation of persistent backdoors, or further lateral movement.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The extension uses Node’s `cp.exec()` to run the command, and basic escaping (e.g. replacing double quotes and dollar signs) is applied in `runPhp`.
- The default configuration is benign when unmodified.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Robust Input Sanitization:** No comprehensive validation or sanitization of the user-supplied `phpCommand` value.
- **Secure Execution Methods:** Lack of parameterized APIs or sandboxing, relying instead on unsafe string concatenation.
- **Additional Access Controls:** No integrity checks or warnings when non‑default command templates are supplied.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must be able to influence the extension’s configuration (for example, by provisioning a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` or via a compromised supply chain).
- The extension must be active and use the configured `phpCommand` to generate autocompletion data.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `helpers.ts`, the function retrieves the command template as follows:
   ```js
   let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
   ```
2. The generated PHP code is inserted by a simple string replacement:
   ```js
   let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);
   ```
3. The assembled command is executed with:
   ```js
   cp.exec(command, { cwd: /* workspace directory */ }, function (err, stdout, stderr) { ... });
   ```
4. Due to the lack of thorough sanitization, an attacker may append additional commands (e.g., `&& rm -rf /important/path`) that will be executed along with the benign PHP code.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup:** Create a new workspace with a file `.vscode/settings.json` containing the following configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}\" && echo 'MALICIOUS CODE EXECUTED' && touch /tmp/hacked"
   }
   ```
2. **Execution:** Open the workspace in VSCode so that the extension executes its periodic autocompletion process by calling `Helpers.runPhp()`.
3. **Verification:**
   - Observe the terminal output or VSCode logs for evidence of the appended shell commands (e.g., the echoed message).
   - Manually check that the file `/tmp/hacked` has been created, confirming that the malicious payload was executed.

## 2. Arbitrary PHP Code Execution via Malicious Laravel Project Bootstrapping

**Description:**
The extension generates autocompletion data by bootstrapping the Laravel application through methods like `Helpers.runLaravel()`. During this process, it constructs a PHP command that includes critical bootstrapping files (typically `vendor/autoload.php` and `bootstrap/app.php`) and concatenates generated PHP snippets intended to output necessary data. Since this process involves executing all code contained in these files—including any service providers, route definitions, or additional bootstrapped application code—an attacker who can inject or modify these Laravel project files can force their malicious payload to be executed. The absence of strict isolation, integrity checks, or sandboxing means that any attacker-controlled PHP code embedded in the Laravel application (whether during bootstrapping or within ancillary files) will execute when the extension initiates its autocompletion process.

**Step-by-Step Trigger Scenario:**
1. An attacker gains the ability to inject PHP code into key Laravel project files (e.g., modifying `bootstrap/app.php`, a service provider, or a route file) so that malicious commands are embedded.
2. When the extension’s autocompletion feature invokes the `Helpers.runLaravel()` method, it builds a PHP command string that first requires these Laravel files.
3. The concatenated command—including both the legitimate bootstrap code and the malicious injection—is executed using Node’s `cp.exec()`.
4. The injected malicious payload (for example, code that writes to a sensitive file or opens a reverse shell) is executed on the developer’s machine without further user intervention.

**Impact:**
- **Full Arbitrary Code Execution:** Execution of attacker-controlled PHP code, which can manipulate files, exfiltrate data, or install persistent backdoors.
- **Compromise of Development Environment:** Unauthorized modifications can result in loss of confidentiality, integrity, and potentially lateral movement within the network.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The extension’s README includes a security advisory recommending users disable the extension when working with sensitive code.
- The extension locates Laravel files using predefined paths (e.g. via `Helpers.projectPath()`) and relies on users to manage the security of their own project files.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Lack of Sandbox Environment:** There is no separate or isolated PHP runtime to prevent potentially dangerous code from affecting the host system.
- **No Integrity Verification:** The bootstrapping files are loaded and executed without verifying their integrity or checking for unauthorized modifications (e.g., via code signing).
- **Absence of User Confirmation:** The extension automatically executes the constructed PHP command without additional user prompts or safeguards.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must be able to modify one or more key Laravel project files (for instance via supply chain compromise, insider attack, or other vulnerabilities leading to write access).
- The developer must open the compromised Laravel project in VSCode with the Laravel Extra Intellisense extension enabled, causing the autocompletion process to trigger the auto-bootstrapping of the Laravel application.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In the `Helpers.runLaravel()` function, the code first checks for the presence of critical files such as `vendor/autoload.php` and `bootstrap/app.php` using functions like `fs.existsSync(Helpers.projectPath("vendor/autoload.php"))`.
2. The function then builds a PHP command string that includes:
   - Including and executing the Laravel autoloader via `require_once`.
   - Bootstrapping the Laravel application by requiring `bootstrap/app.php`.
   - Registering a custom service provider and then appending a dynamic PHP snippet intended to generate autocomplete output.
3. Since the entire Laravel bootstrap process is executed without sandboxing or integrity checks, any injected malicious PHP in these files (for example, inserted into a service provider’s `boot` method) is executed.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup:** Prepare a test Laravel project in an isolated environment. Modify one of its files (e.g., add a new service provider or alter `bootstrap/app.php`) by injecting a benign payload such as:
   ```php
   file_put_contents('/tmp/extension_hacked.txt', 'Hacked by test payload');
   ```
2. **Execution:** Open the modified Laravel project in VSCode with the Laravel Extra Intellisense extension active, which triggers the `Helpers.runLaravel()` method.
3. **Verification:**
   - Check for the presence of the file `/tmp/extension_hacked.txt` and confirm it contains the expected payload text.
   - Verify from logs or system monitoring that the malicious payload was executed as part of the bootstrapping process.

*Note:* Both vulnerabilities are critical due to the potential for full system compromise and are realistic attack vectors if an attacker controls the workspace configuration or is able to modify project files. The absence of robust sanitization, isolation, and integrity checks makes these attack vectors especially dangerous in real-world scenarios.
