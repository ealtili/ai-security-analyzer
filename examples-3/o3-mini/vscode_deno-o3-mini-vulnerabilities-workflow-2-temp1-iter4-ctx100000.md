## 1. Insecure Deno Path Configuration Vulnerability

**Vulnerability Name:**
Insecure Deno Path Configuration Vulnerability

**Description:**
The extension reads the path to the Deno CLI executable from workspace configuration (via the `"deno.path"` setting) and then uses that value with little or no validation. In detail, when a workspace configuration is loaded:

1. The extension calls a helper (e.g. `getDenoCommandPath()` in `client/src/util.ts`) which retrieves the user-specified `"deno.path"` value.
2. If the supplied value is absolute, it is returned immediately; if it is relative, the extension resolves it against the current workspace folder.
3. No further checks are performed to verify that the resolved path points to the genuine Deno executable.
4. Later, in functions such as `startLanguageServer()` (in `client/src/commands.ts`), the returned value is used directly to spawn a child process (e.g. to start the language server).

An attacker who can influence the workspace configuration (for example by compromising a repository’s `.vscode/settings.json` or a `deno.json` file) can supply a path that instead points to a malicious executable. When the extension runs, the unvalidated path is executed, triggering the malicious payload.

**Impact:**
- The malicious executable may run arbitrary code on the victim’s machine.
- This can lead to full system compromise, including data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or arbitrary command execution.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- For relative paths, the extension resolves the executable against the workspace folder.
- A basic file existence check (using asynchronous methods like `fs.stat` or a custom `fileExists` function) is performed.
- A try/catch block logs errors if the file is not found.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- No verification exists to ensure that the provided path really points to the genuine Deno binary.
- There is no integrity check, digital signature verification, or whitelist enforcement.
- The extension does not prompt the user when an atypical or absolute executable path is provided.

**Preconditions:**
- An attacker must be able to control or modify the workspace configuration (for example, via a malicious commit in a repository or by exploiting auto-loaded settings).
- The victim must open the affected workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension enabled.
- File system permissions must allow execution of the file specified in `"deno.path"`.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `client/src/util.ts`, the function (e.g., `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`) retrieves the `"deno.path"` setting using:
    ```ts
    const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string>("path");
    ```
   If the value is an absolute path, it is returned immediately without further checks.
2. In functions like `getDenoCommandPath()`, the returned value is passed along without sanitization.
3. In `client/src/commands.ts` (for example, in `startLanguageServer()`), the command is used to construct a process–spawn call:
    ```ts
    const command = await getDenoCommandPath();
    const serverOptions = {
      run: { command, args: ["lsp"], options: { env } },
      debug: { command, args: ["lsp"], options: { env } }
    };
    ```
4. No code is present to validate the authenticity or integrity of the executable at the provided path.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup:**
   - Create a workspace containing a `.vscode/settings.json` file that includes:
     ```json
     {
       "deno.path": "/tmp/malicious_executable"
     }
     ```
   - On a test system, create a dummy (benign for testing) executable at `/tmp/malicious_executable` that, for example, writes a file (e.g., `/tmp/hacked.txt`) when executed.
2. **Execution:**
   - Open the workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension enabled.
   - Trigger an action that starts the language server (for example, by running the “Deno: Enable” command).
3. **Verification:**
   - Check for evidence of execution on the system (e.g., verify that the file `/tmp/hacked.txt` is created with the expected text).
   - Confirm that the unvalidated `"deno.path"` value led to the execution of the malicious dummy executable.

## 2. Malicious Workspace Configuration Injection for Deno CLI Processes

**Vulnerability Name:**
Malicious Workspace Configuration Injection for Deno CLI Processes

**Description:**
The extension loads several critical settings—such as `"deno.path"`, `"deno.config"`, and `"deno.codeLens.testArgs"`—directly from workspace configuration files (for example, a project’s `.vscode/settings.json`). The process is as follows:

1. When a workspace is opened, the extension immediately reads these configuration values using VS Code’s settings API.
2. The values (which may include an overridden Deno executable path, extra CLI flags, or alternate configuration file locations) are then directly passed to functions that spawn new processes (e.g., for starting the language server or running tests).
3. No rigorous validation, sanitization, or user confirmation is performed to ensure that these settings come from a trusted source or are formatted safely.

An attacker controlling the workspace configuration (for instance, by compromising the repository or tricking the victim into opening an untrusted workspace) may inject malicious values. These values could cause the extension to spawn processes with attacker‑controlled parameters or even point to a malicious executable.

**Impact:**
- An attacker could force the execution of arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user running Visual Studio Code.
- This could result in full system compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and potential escalation of privileges.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The extension performs basic existence checks (for example, using `fs.stat` for `"deno.path"`) and attempts to resolve relative paths against the workspace.
- These checks, however, only confirm that a file exists and do not validate whether the configuration values are trustworthy or safe.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- There is no rigorous input validation or whitelist enforcement for the configuration values.
- The extension does not prompt the user to accept or review the injected values (especially for keys like `"deno.path"` or `"deno.codeLens.testArgs"`).
- No sanitization is performed on additional CLI arguments that could be injected via the workspace configuration.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must have a means to supply or modify the workspace configuration file (for example, via a compromised repository or through an auto-loaded settings file).
- The victim must open the affected workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension active.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In `client/src/util.ts`, the extension retrieves configuration settings (such as `"deno.path"`) using:
    ```ts
    const value = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string>("key");
    ```
2. In `client/src/commands.ts`, multiple commands (including starting the language server, test execution, and task creation) use these retrieved settings without any further validation.
3. The direct injection of unsanitized configuration values into process-creation functions means that any attacker-controlled input will directly influence the execution environment of spawned Deno processes.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup:**
   - Create a test workspace with a `.vscode/settings.json` file that includes malicious entries, for example:
     ```json
     {
       "deno.path": "/tmp/malicious_executable",
       "deno.codeLens.testArgs": ["--malicious-flag", "payload"]
     }
     ```
   - Place a dummy executable at `/tmp/malicious_executable` that generates an observable effect when executed.
2. **Execution:**
   - Open the workspace in Visual Studio Code.
   - Trigger a Deno-based command (for instance, by starting the language server or running the “Deno: Test” command).
3. **Verification:**
   - Confirm that the dummy executable is launched by checking for expected side effects (such as the creation of a file or specific log messages).
   - Verify that extra CLI arguments (e.g., `"--malicious-flag"`) are passed to the spawned process.
   - These observations confirm that unsanitized workspace configuration values can lead to the execution of attacker-controlled code.

## 3. Malicious Import Map and Command-Line Injection Vulnerability

**Vulnerability Name:**
Malicious Import Map and Command-Line Injection Vulnerability

**Description:**
The extension retrieves the `"deno.importMap"` configuration value from workspace settings and uses it directly when constructing command-line arguments for the Deno CLI (for example, in the test command). The steps are as follows:

1. During the execution of a Deno-related command (such as “Deno: Test”), the extension retrieves the import map setting:
    ```ts
    const importMap: string | undefined | null = config.get("importMap");
    ```
2. If the value is defined and non‑empty (after a basic trim), the extension appends it as an argument:
    ```ts
    if (importMap?.trim()) {
      testArgs.push("--import-map", importMap.trim());
    }
    ```
3. Because there is no validation beyond trimming, an attacker can supply a malicious import map string that either:
   - Remaps well‑known module specifiers to attacker‑controlled URLs (leading to remote module resolution of malicious code), or
   - Injects extra command‑line arguments (enabling command injection).

**Impact:**
- If exploited, the Deno CLI may fetch and execute code from an attacker‑controlled URL.
- Additionally, extra injected arguments could alter the behavior of the Deno process, resulting in command injection.
- Both vectors can lead to remote code execution and ultimately full system compromise.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- Only a basic string trim is performed on the `"deno.importMap"` value.
- The processed value is passed directly as a command-line argument using the `"--import-map"` flag.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- No runtime validation or sanitization is applied to ensure that the value is a safe file path or URL.
- There is no whitelist of acceptable formats or domains.
- The extension does not prompt the user or enforce constraints to prevent extra injected flags within the import map string.

**Preconditions:**
- An attacker must be able to supply or modify the workspace configuration or the associated import map file (such as via a malicious `deno.json` or direct tampering with the import map file).
- The victim must open the compromised workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension enabled.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. In the test command implementation (located in `client/src/commands.ts`), the extension retrieves the `"deno.importMap"` configuration:
    ```ts
    const importMap: string | undefined | null = config.get("importMap");
    ```
2. Without further sanitization (other than a simple trim), the value is appended along with the `"--import-map"` flag:
    ```ts
    if (importMap?.trim()) {
      testArgs.push("--import-map", importMap.trim());
    }
    ```
3. Because the string is not parsed or validated, an attacker can:
   - Supply a string that remaps module URLs to an attacker’s server.
   - Append additional CLI options (for example, separating legitimate file paths from malicious flags).
4. This unsanitized argument list is then passed directly to the Deno CLI when spawning a new process, leaving the door open to both an erroneous module resolution and command injection.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup:**
   - Prepare a workspace with a configuration file (e.g., `.vscode/settings.json` or `deno.json`) that sets:
     ```json
     {
       "deno.importMap": "./legit_import_map.json --malicious-flag"
     }
     ```
   - Create the file `legit_import_map.json` and modify it so that a common module specifier (for example, `"https://deno.land/std/"`) is remapped to an attacker-controlled URL (e.g., `"https://attacker.com/malicious.js"`).
2. **Execution:**
   - Open the workspace in Visual Studio Code.
   - Trigger a Deno command that uses the import map (for example, “Deno: Test” or “Deno: Cache”).
3. **Verification:**
   - Monitor the spawned Deno process’s arguments (or observe through network logs) to verify that:
     - The extra injected flag (`"--malicious-flag"`) appears in the command line.
     - The Deno CLI attempts to load modules as remapped by the malicious import map.
   - These observations confirm that unsanitized import map values can lead to remote module resolution attacks and command injection.
