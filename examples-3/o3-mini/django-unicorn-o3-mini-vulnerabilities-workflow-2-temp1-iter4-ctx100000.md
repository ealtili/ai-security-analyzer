## 1. Unsafe “Safe” Marking Leading to Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description
Developers of Django‑Unicorn components can explicitly mark component properties as “safe” (using the Meta configuration or the “|safe” filter) to bypass Django’s autoescaping. In doing so, the normal output‐encoding—meant to protect against cross‑site scripting (XSS)—is skipped. An attacker can exploit this if they can supply malicious input to a property that was marked safe. For example, by submitting a payload such as `<script>alert('XSS');</script>` (or similar variants like `"><script>alert('xss')</script>`) via an AJAX–driven reactive update, the malicious content is rendered verbatim into the final DOM. Once the component re‑renders, the browser executes the unsanitized payload.

**Step‑by‑Step Trigger:**
1. **Component Configuration:**
   A developer creates a Unicorn component and marks a public property (e.g. “hello”, “comment”, or “message”) as safe via the component’s Meta.safe tuple or by applying the “|safe” filter in the template.
2. **User Input Binding:**
   The marked property is bound to a user‑supplied input—typically via a reactive input field that updates the component state.
3. **Payload Submission:**
   An attacker submits an AJAX payload containing malicious HTML/JavaScript (e.g. `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`) to update the safe‐marked property.
4. **Bypassed Sanitization:**
   Because the property is flagged as safe, the framework bypasses normal output‐escaping (such as the call to `sanitize_html`), and the unsanitized payload is directly merged into the component’s rendered output.
5. **Payload Execution:**
   The browser processes the DOM update and executes the injected JavaScript, resulting in an XSS attack.

### Impact
- **Session Hijacking & Credential Theft:**
  The injected script may steal cookies or other session data.
- **Client‑Side Manipulation:**
  Malicious JavaScript can alter the DOM, redirect users, or modify application behavior.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**
  Execution of attacker–supplied code in the browser context.

### Vulnerability Rank
**High**

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- **Default Escaping:**
  All component property data is autoescaped during normal Django template rendering.
- **Sanitization Helper:**
  The JSON initialization process uses a helper (e.g. `sanitize_html`) for basic character escaping.
- **Opt‑in for Unsafe Output:**
  Only properties explicitly marked as safe (via Meta.safe or the “|safe” filter) bypass these measures.

### Missing Mitigations
- **Context‑Sensitive Encoding:**
  No additional output encoding is applied for properties marked safe beyond the basic translations.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
  Out‑of‑the‑box enforcement of CSP headers (which could mitigate inline script execution) is missing.
- **Developer Alerts / Audit Logging:**
  There is no warning mechanism when a property is designated as safe, despite its potential to hold untrusted input.

### Preconditions
- A component property is configured to bypass autoescaping (marked as safe).
- The property is bound to input that accepts or reflects attacker‐supplied data.
- The reactive AJAX endpoint (e.g. `/message/`) is publicly accessible.

### Source Code Analysis
- **Template Tag Logic:**
  In `django_unicorn/templatetags/unicorn.py`, when constructing the context for rendering, any property marked safe avoids the standard autoescaping path.
- **Property Update Functions:**
  Functions such as `set_property_from_data` update properties directly with incoming request data without performing additional HTML‑escaping.
- **JSON Serialization:**
  The custom JSON serializer (often built on orjson) skips the extra sanitization for safe‑marked fields, leading to direct insertion into the DOM.
- **Test Evidence:**
  Tests like `test_safe_html_entities_not_encoded` (in `tests/views/test_process_component_request.py`) demonstrate that safe‐marked properties output embedded HTML verbatim.

### Security Test Case
1. **Setup the Component:**
   - Create a Unicorn component (e.g. “HelloWorldComponent”) that defines a property (e.g. `hello`) and marks it as safe in the Meta configuration.
   - Bind an input element in the component’s template to the `hello` property.
2. **Inject Malicious Payload:**
   - From an external client (or using an AJAX simulator), submit the payload `<script>alert('XSS');</script>` via the input bound to `hello`.
3. **Trigger the Update:**
   - Initiate an action (such as a “syncInput” or callMethod) to cause the component to re‑render.
4. **Verification:**
   - Open the browser’s developer tools and inspect the updated DOM to confirm that the unsanitized payload is present.
   - Observe that the injected script executes (for example, an alert dialog appears), confirming the vulnerability.

## 2. Insecure Deserialization via Pickle in Component Caching

### Description
Django‑Unicorn caches the complete component state—including hierarchies and supplementary context—by serializing it using Python’s pickle module. If an attacker can write to or manipulate the cache backend (for instance, via a mis‑configured or publicly accessible Redis instance), they can inject a malicious pickle payload. Later, when the application restores the component state using `restore_from_cache`, it blindly deserializes the payload via `pickle.loads(...)`, which may execute arbitrary code.

**Step‑by‑Step Trigger:**
1. **Identify a Mis‑configured Cache:**
   The attacker finds that the cache backend (such as Redis) is accessible and writable.
2. **Inject Malicious Payload:**
   The attacker writes a crafted, malicious pickle payload into the cache, for example under a key pattern like `unicorn:component:<component_id>`.
3. **Trigger Cache Restoration:**
   When the affected component is updated or re‑rendered, the framework invokes `restore_from_cache()`, which retrieves and deserializes the cached payload.
4. **Malicious Code Execution:**
   The malicious payload is processed by `pickle.loads(...)` without integrity checks, executing the attacker’s code on the host.

### Impact
- **Remote Code Execution:**
  Arbitrary code execution on the server can compromise the entire host process.
- **Full System Compromise:**
  An attacker gaining execution privileges may access sensitive data, escalate privileges, or further manipulate the system.

### Vulnerability Rank
**Critical**

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- **Trusted Cache Backend:**
  The framework relies on Django’s caching backend, which is generally expected to be secured and available only within trusted environments.
- **Limited Exposure:**
  The caching mechanism is not directly exposed to end users.

### Missing Mitigations
- **Safe Serialization Alternative:**
  There is no fallback to a safe serialization mechanism (such as JSON) for sensitive component state.
- **Integrity and Signing Checks:**
  No explicit integrity verification (e.g. signing cached data) is performed before deserialization.

### Preconditions
- The attacker must have access to modify or inject cache entries (typically due to mis‑configuration).
- A component state cached via pickle is later restored without validating the payload.

### Source Code Analysis
- **Caching Process:**
  In `django_unicorn/cacher.py`, the component state is serialized using `pickle.dumps(component)` for caching.
- **Deserialization Point:**
  The function `restore_from_cache()` retrieves the cached payload and directly calls `pickle.loads(...)` without any integrity verification.
- **Lack of Additional Checks:**
  This design means that externally manipulated cache entries are deserialized in a vulnerable manner.

### Security Test Case
1. **Simulate a Mis‑configured Cache:**
   - Configure the application to use a cache backend (or simulate one) that is externally writable.
2. **Inject a Malicious Payload:**
   - Under the appropriate cache key (e.g. `unicorn:component:<component_id>`), insert a crafted pickle payload designed to execute identifiable side‑effects (such as writing to a file or logging a specific marker).
3. **Trigger Cache Restoration:**
   - Initiate a component update that forces the application to call `restore_from_cache()`.
4. **Observation:**
   - Verify that the malicious payload executes by checking for the known side‑effect, confirming remote code execution.

## 3. Component Hijacking via Checksum Bypass

### Description
Django‑Unicorn protects its component state during AJAX updates by computing an HMAC‑based checksum over the payload using Django’s SECRET_KEY. This checksum is meant to ensure that the payload has not been tampered with. However, if the SECRET_KEY is weak, guessable, or otherwise compromised, an attacker can compute a valid checksum for a modified payload. By doing so, the attacker can bypass this integrity check to hijack the component state.

**Step‑by‑Step Trigger:**
1. **Compromise the SECRET_KEY:**
   The attacker obtains, guesses, or identifies a weak Django SECRET_KEY.
2. **Craft a Malicious Payload:**
   The attacker creates a modified AJAX request payload designed to alter sensitive state or invoke unauthorized methods.
3. **Compute a Valid Checksum:**
   Using the known SECRET_KEY, the attacker computes an HMAC‑SHA256 checksum that matches the malicious payload.
4. **Submit the Payload:**
   The attacker sends the crafted payload (with the valid checksum) to the publicly accessible AJAX endpoint.
5. **Bypass Verification & Hijack State:**
   Since the checksum verifies correctly, the framework processes the payload, allowing the attacker to alter the component state arbitrarily.

### Impact
- **Unauthorized State Manipulation:**
  The attacker can update the component’s internal state or invoke methods remotely.
- **Potential Remote Actions:**
  Sensitive methods that affect application logic or data may be triggered, bypassing intended safeguards.

### Vulnerability Rank
**High**

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- **HMAC‑SHA256 Checksum:**
  The framework generates the checksum using HMAC‑SHA256 based on the Django SECRET_KEY.
- **AJAX Request Verification:**
  Incoming payloads are only processed if the provided checksum matches the computed value.

### Missing Mitigations
- **Additional Context‑Based Validation:**
  There is no secondary check (such as per‑user or per‑session validation) to further verify the legitimacy of the payload.
- **Defense‑in‑Depth Mechanisms:**
  Reliance solely on the SECRET_KEY–based checksum means that if the key is weak or leaked, no further protections are in place.

### Preconditions
- The attacker must have access to (or be able to guess) the Django SECRET_KEY.
- The AJAX endpoint for component updates must be publicly accessible.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate the payload sent to the endpoint.

### Source Code Analysis
- **Checksum Generation:**
  In `django_unicorn/utils.py`, the `generate_checksum()` function uses HMAC‑SHA256 with the Django SECRET_KEY to compute the integrity checksum.
- **Verification Process:**
  During request processing (in files like `django_unicorn/views/objects.py`), the incoming payload’s checksum is compared against one computed on the fly. No additional layers of validation are applied.
- **Bypass Scenario:**
  If an attacker recalculates a valid checksum for a maliciously altered payload, the integrity check is bypassed, allowing the unauthorized state change.

### Security Test Case
1. **Environment Setup:**
   - In a test environment, configure the Django SECRET_KEY to a known (preferably weak) value.
2. **Payload Crafting:**
   - Forge an AJAX payload that invokes a sensitive action (e.g. a “callMethod” action modifying critical state).
   - Use the known SECRET_KEY to compute the correct checksum for the malicious payload.
3. **Submit the Crafted Request:**
   - Send the AJAX request with the modified payload and valid checksum to the component update endpoint.
4. **Verification:**
   - Verify that the component state has been altered as per the attacker's design (e.g. by observing changed UI state or backend data), confirming the hijacking vulnerability.
