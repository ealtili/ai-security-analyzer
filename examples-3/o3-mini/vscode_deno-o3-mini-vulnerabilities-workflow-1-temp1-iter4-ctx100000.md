## Vulnerability: Arbitrary Command Execution via Malicious **`deno.path`** Configuration

**Description:**
The extension determines the executable path for launching the Deno language server by reading the workspace configuration (for example, from a `.vscode/settings.json` file) to obtain the value of `"deno.path"`. The process unfolds as follows:

1. **Configuration Retrieval:**
   - The extension calls a utility function (e.g., `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` in `client/src/util.ts`) that retrieves the `"deno.path"` setting via the VS Code API:
     ```javascript
     const command = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string>("path");
     ```
   - No sanitization or validation is performed on the value.

2. **Path Resolution:**
   - Inside `getDenoCommandPath()`, if the provided path is not absolute, the extension iterates over available workspace folders and resolves the path using:
     ```javascript
     const commandPath = path.resolve(workspaceFolder.uri.fsPath, command);
     ```
   - A basic file existence check (using `fs.stat`) is performed, but the check does not confirm the file’s trustworthiness or origin.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - The resolved executable path is passed to the function `startLanguageServer()` in `client/src/commands.ts`, which uses it to spawn a new process (for example, with the arguments `["lsp"]`) via a process-spawning API (such as `child_process.spawn` inside a LanguageClient configuration).

An attacker who controls a repository can commit a `.vscode/settings.json` file that includes a manipulated configuration such as:
```json
{
  "deno.enable": true,
  "deno.path": "./malicious_executable"
}
```
In addition, the attacker must provide the corresponding malicious file (or shim) at the specified location. When a user opens such a repository, the extension will resolve the path and execute the malicious payload without further checks.

**Impact:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the victim’s machine. The malicious executable is launched with the privileges of the VS Code process, which can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further lateral movement.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- A simple check is performed to verify that a file exists at the given path (using an asynchronous `fs.stat` call).

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Input Validation and Sanitization:** No measures are in place to ensure that the `"deno.path"` value points to a known and trusted executable.
- **Path Restrictions:** There is no enforcement to require an absolute path or to restrict execution to a whitelist of approved binary locations.
- **User Confirmation:** No warning or confirmation step is provided when a critical executable is overridden by workspace settings.

**Preconditions:**
- The victim opens a repository or workspace containing a manipulated configuration file (e.g., `.vscode/settings.json`) where `"deno.path"` is set to an attacker‑controlled value.
- A malicious executable file exists (or is planted) at the specified location.
- The Deno extension is activated, and the workspace settings are loaded without explicit user validation.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- **Retrieving the Setting:**
  - In `client/src/util.ts`, the function retrieves the value without any verification:
    ```javascript
    const command = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string>("path");
    ```
- **Path Resolution and Existence Check:**
  - In `getDenoCommandPath()`, non‑absolute paths are resolved by iterating through workspace folders:
    ```javascript
    if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
      for (const workspace of workspaceFolders) {
        const commandPath = path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command);
        if (await fileExists(commandPath)) {
          return commandPath;
        }
      }
      return undefined;
    }
    ```
- **Process Execution:**
  - In `client/src/commands.ts`, the resolved command is used to spawn the language server:
    ```javascript
    const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
      run: { command, args: ["lsp"], options: { env } },
      debug: { command, args: ["lsp"], options: { env } },
    };
    ```
  - The lack of further checks allows an attacker‑provided executable to be executed with the victim’s privileges.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup a Malicious Repository:**
   - Create a repository containing a `.vscode/settings.json` file with the following content:
     ```json
     {
       "deno.enable": true,
       "deno.path": "./malicious_executable"
     }
     ```
   - In the repository root, include an executable file named `malicious_executable` that performs a detectable action (for example, writing a file such as `pwned.txt` or logging a message).

2. **Execution:**
   - Open the repository in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension installed.
   - Allow the workspace settings to be applied, which triggers the language server startup.

3. **Observation:**
   - Monitor the system for evidence that `malicious_executable` is executed (e.g., check for the creation of `pwned.txt` or observe distinctive log messages).
   - Verification of the malicious executable being spawned confirms that the vulnerability is exploitable.

4. **Cleanup:**
   - Remove the malicious configuration and executable once testing is complete.

## Vulnerability: Environment Variable Injection via Malicious **`envFile`** Setting

**Description:**
The extension also supports loading environment variables from a file specified by the `"envFile"` setting in workspace configuration. The triggering process is as follows:

1. **Configuration Retrieval:**
   - The extension retrieves the `"envFile"` value using a call similar to:
     ```typescript
     const denoEnvFile = config.get<string>("envFile");
     ```
     This is done within functions such as `startLanguageServer()` or `test()` in `client/src/commands.ts`.

2. **Path Construction:**
   - The file path is constructed by concatenating the workspace folder’s path with the provided `envFile` value:
     ```typescript
     const denoEnvPath = path.join(workspaceFolder.uri.fsPath, denoEnvFile);
     ```
   - No validation is performed to ensure that the resulting path is restricted to a trusted directory. This omission allows directory traversal (e.g., using `../`).

3. **Environment Variable Injection:**
   - The file at the constructed path is read and parsed using the `dotenv` library.
   - The parsed environment variables are then merged into the environment of the spawned Deno process.

An attacker can exploit this by including a configuration file in a repository with a malicious entry such as:
```json
{
  "envFile": "../malicious.env"
}
```
When the repository is opened, the extension will load and parse `malicious.env` from a location outside the intended workspace, thereby injecting attacker‑controlled environment variables into the process.

**Impact:**
Injection of malicious environment variables can alter the behavior of the Deno language server or any spawned Deno process. The injected variables might modify configuration parameters or load unexpected libraries, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or even facilitating further code execution.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The file path is constructed using `path.join()`, which combines the workspace folder path with the `envFile` value.
- The file is then read and parsed normally; no additional checks are in place.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Input Sanitization:** There is no filtering to prevent directory traversal or path manipulation in the `"envFile"` value.
- **Path Restrictions:** No enforcement exists to restrict the file lookup to a designated safe directory or whitelist of allowed files.
- **Content Validation:** The contents of the environment file are not validated for malicious input prior to inclusion in the process environment.

**Preconditions:**
- The victim opens a repository (or workspace) that supplies a manipulated `.vscode/settings.json` file where `"envFile"` is set to a value allowing directory traversal (e.g., `"../malicious.env"`).
- The target file (`malicious.env`) exists in the specified location and contains environment variable definitions that can maliciously influence the spawned process.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- **Configuration Retrieval:**
  - The extension retrieves the `"envFile"` setting as shown in:
    ```typescript
    const denoEnvFile = config.get<string>("envFile");
    ```
- **Path Construction:**
  - The complete file path is built with:
    ```typescript
    const denoEnvPath = path.join(workspaceFolder.uri.fsPath, denoEnvFile);
    ```
  - There is no subsequent validation to confirm that `denoEnvPath` does not resolve outside an approved directory.

- **Parsing and Injection:**
  - The file at `denoEnvPath` is read and parsed using `dotenv.parse`, and its values are merged into the environment options provided to the process that starts the Deno language server.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup a Malicious Repository:**
   - Create a repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` file containing:
     ```json
     {
       "envFile": "../malicious.env"
     }
     ```
   - Place a file named `malicious.env` in the parent directory of the workspace (or simulate such a placement) containing test environment variables (e.g., `MALICIOUS_FLAG=1`).

2. **Execution:**
   - Open the repository in Visual Studio Code so that the extension loads and processes the `"envFile"` setting.
   - Observe the initialization of the Deno language server or related processes.

3. **Observation:**
   - Check that the environment variables from `malicious.env` are merged into the process environment. This can be verified by logging the environment, observing a change in behavior, or checking for the presence of a known variable (e.g., `MALICIOUS_FLAG` is active).
   - Confirm that the injected environment variables originate from a file outside the intended workspace directory.

4. **Cleanup:**
   - Remove or correct the malicious configuration to revert to standard, trusted operation.
