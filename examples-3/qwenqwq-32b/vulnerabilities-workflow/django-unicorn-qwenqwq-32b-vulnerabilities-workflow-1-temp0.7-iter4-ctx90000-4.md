### Updated Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability: Insecure Deserialization Using Pickle in Caching (Critical)
**Description**:
The Django Unicorn framework uses `pickle` for caching components in `django_unicorn/cacher.py`. This allows storing and retrieving serialized objects in the Django cache. However, since `pickle` deserialization can execute arbitrary code if tampered with, this creates a **Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability**. An attacker who can manipulate cached data could inject malicious `pickle` data, leading to code execution when the component is restored.

---

**Impact**:
An attacker could gain full control over the server by exploiting this vulnerability.

---

**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

---

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
- None, as this vulnerability is still present.

---

**Missing Mitigations**:
- Replace `pickle` with secure serialization (e.g., `orjson`) in caching.
- Validate method names and properties to prevent unauthorized method invocations.
- Upgrade to Django Unicorn v0.62.0+ which removes `pickle` usage.

---

**Preconditions**:
- The attacker can inject or control cached data (e.g., through cache key manipulation or access to the cache storage).

---

**Source Code Analysis**:
In `cacher.py`, `pickle` is used for serializing/deserializing cached components:
```python
def cache_full_tree(component):
    # Uses pickle.dumps() to serialize the component
    cache.set(component.component_cache_key, pickle.dumps(component), timeout=...)
```

When restoring the component:
```python
def restore_from_cache(component_cache_key):
    # Uses pickle.loads() to deserialize cached data
    return pickle.loads(cache.get(component_cache_key))
```

This allows an attacker to craft a `pickle` payload stored in the cache, which executes when `restore_from_cache` runs.

---

**Security Test Case**:
1. **Preparation**: Ensure the app uses Django Unicorn with unpatched `cacher.py` relying on `pickle`.
2. **Exploit**: Inject a malicious `pickle` payload into the Django cache (e.g., via `cache.set()` with a crafted key).
3. **Trigger**: Access an endpoint that triggers `restore_from_cache`, causing deserialization of the malicious payload.
4. **Verification**: Observe unauthorized code execution (e.g., reverse shell, file write).

---

**Conclusion**:
Immediate mitigation is required to eliminate the critical RCE risk from insecure deserialization.
