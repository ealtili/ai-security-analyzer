### Vulnerability List

#### 1. **Unsanitized AI-Generated Code Execution**
**Description**:
The backend processes user-submitted images and generates code using AI models like GPT-4 or Claude. The generated code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is returned directly to the frontend without any sanitization or validation. An attacker can craft an image designed to trick the AI into generating malicious code (e.g., XSS payloads, cross-site scripting, or phishing scripts). The frontend executes this code verbatim, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser.

**Impact**:
Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or malicious redirects.
**Rank**: Critical
**Current Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Sanitize the AI-generated code to remove executable scripts (e.g., `<script>` tags).
- Implement strict Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to block inline scripts.
- Validate and restrict the output code to safe frameworks (e.g., disallow `eval`, `innerHTML`, etc.).
**Preconditions**: None.
**Source Code Analysis**:
- In `routes/generate_code.py`, the AI's response (`completion`) is returned directly without sanitization:
  ```python
  await send_message("setCode", updated_html, index)
  ```
- Mock responses in `mock_llm.py` include executable JavaScript (e.g., `MORTGAGE_CALCULATOR_VIDEO_PROMPT_MOCK` contains jQuery code).
**Security Test Case**:
1. Submit an image designed to trigger AI-generated code with `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
2. Observe the frontend executing the script.

#### 6. **Missing Content Security Policy (CSP)**
**Description**:
The frontend does not enforce a CSP header to restrict script sources, allowing inline scripts from the AI-generated code to execute.

**Impact**:
XSS attacks via malicious scripts in generated code.
**Rank**: High
**Current Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Add a strict CSP header to the backend responses:
  ```python
  response.headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = "script-src 'none'"
  ```
**Preconditions**: None.
**Source Code Analysis**:
- The backend (`main.py`) does not set any CSP headers.
**Security Test Case**:
1. Inject a `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` via crafted image.
2. Verify the script executes due to missing CSP.

### Summary of Critical Vulnerabilities
1. **Unsanitized AI-Generated Code Execution** (Critical): Immediate mitigation required via code sanitization and CSP.
2. **Missing Content Security Policy** (High): Implement strict CSP headers to block inline scripts.

These vulnerabilities collectively enable attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted images due to a lack of input sanitization and missing security controls.
