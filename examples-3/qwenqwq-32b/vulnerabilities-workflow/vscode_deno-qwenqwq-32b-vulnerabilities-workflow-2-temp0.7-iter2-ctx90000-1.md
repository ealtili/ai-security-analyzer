### Vulnerability: Arbitrary Code Execution via Manipulated Deno Executable Path

#### Description
The Visual Studio Code extension for Deno allows the configuration of the Deno executable path via `deno.path` in settings. If an attacker can manipulate this path to point to a malicious executable, the extension will execute this binary when performing operations like language server initialization, testing, debugging, or task execution. This vulnerability arises because the extension does not validate or verify the authenticity of the specified Deno executable path.

#### Step-by-Step Trigger
1. **Malicious Path Configuration**:
   - An attacker modifies the `deno.path` setting in VS Code settings to point to a malicious Deno binary (e.g., `C:\malicious\deno.exe` on Windows or `/opt/malicious/deno` on Linux).
   - This can be done through user manipulation (trickery), compromised workspace settings, or compromised system PATH variables.

2. **Extension Initialization**:
   - When the Deno extension starts or a command requiring the Deno executable runs (e.g., language server, testing, debugging), it calls `getDenoCommandPath()` in `client/src/commands.ts`.
   - The function retrieves the path from `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("deno").get("path")` and uses it directly without validation.

3. **Execution of Malicious Binary**:
   - The malicious path is used to spawn processes via Node.js `child_process` (e.g., in `startLanguageServer()` calling `new LanguageClient(...)` with the malicious command).
   - Critical operations like `deno.lsp` (language server), debugging, testing, or task execution execute the attacker-controlled binary, leading to arbitrary code execution.

#### Impact
Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the VS Code process. This can lead to full system compromise, data theft, or malware installation.

#### Vulnerability Rank
**Critical**
Exploitation requires only configuration manipulation, which is feasible through social engineering or insecure workspace settings.

#### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- None. The extension does not validate the executable path, trust the binary, or check for known good hashes/signatures.

#### Missing Mitigations
- **Path Validation**:
  - Check if the path points to a legitimate Deno binary (e.g., verifying the binary’s hash against known good versions).
- **Environment Isolation**:
  - Use a sandbox or restricted environment when executing the Deno binary.
- **Default Path Security**:
  - Warn users if the path is user-modified and not the default system-installed Deno.
- **Executable Signature Checks**:
  - Validate the Deno executable’s cryptographic signature to ensure authenticity.

#### Preconditions
- The attacker has write access to the VS Code settings (user/workspace) or system environment variables.
- The malicious path is correctly formatted and executable.

#### Source Code Analysis
1. **Path Retrieval**:
   - In `client/src/commands.ts`, `getDenoCommandPath()` retrieves the path from settings without validation:
     ```typescript
     const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
     // ...
     return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
     ```

2. **Process Execution**:
   - The malicious path is directly used in `startLanguageServer()` to spawn the Deno language server:
     ```typescript
     const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
       run: {
         command,
         args: ["lsp"],
         options: { env },
       },
     };
     new LanguageClient(..., serverOptions, ...);
     ```

3. **Debug Configuration**:
   - The malicious path is used in debug commands via `getDenoCommandName()` in `debug_config_provider.ts`:
     ```typescript
     runtimeExecutable: await getDenoCommandName(),
     ```

4. **Task Execution**:
   - Tasks use the path through `tasks.ts`:
     ```typescript
     const denoCommand = await getDenoCommandName();
     new ProcessExecution(denoCommand, ["task", ...args]);
     ```

#### Security Test Case
1. **Setup**:
   - Create a malicious executable (e.g., `bad_deno.sh` on Linux or `bad_deno.exe` on Windows) that writes a unique string to a file (e.g., `/tmp/exploit_success`).
   - Configure VS Code settings to point `deno.path` to this executable’s path.

2. **Trigger**:
   - Open a Deno project in VS Code.
   - Execute a Deno-related command (e.g., `Deno: Cache Active Document`, debugging, or running a task).

3. **Verification**:
   - Check if the malicious executable ran by verifying the existence of `/tmp/exploit_success` (or equivalent on Windows).
   - The extension should execute the malicious binary, proving arbitrary code execution.
