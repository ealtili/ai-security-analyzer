### 2. **Lack of Rate Limiting for API Requests**
**Description**: The backend does not enforce rate limits on API endpoints, enabling attackers to send excessive requests to exhaust resources or API quotas.
**Trigger Steps**:
1. An attacker sends a high volume of requests to endpoints like `/generate-code`.
2. The backend processes all requests without throttling, consuming API credits or slowing down the service.
**Impact**: Exhausts paid API quotas (e.g., OpenAI), leading to financial loss or service disruption. Could also be leveraged for DoS indirectly.
**Vulnerability Rank**: High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**: Implement rate limiting using tools like `slowapi` or middleware.
**Preconditions**: None.
**Source Code Analysis**:
- No rate-limiting middleware is added to FastAPI routes in `backend/main.py`.
**Security Test Case**:
1. Deploy the backend.
2. Use `curl` or a stress-testing tool (e.g., `bombardier`) to send 100+ requests to `/generate-code` in quick succession.
3. Observe successful completion of all requests and API quota exhaustion.

### 10. **No Authentication for Sensitive Endpoints**
**Description**: Endpoints like `/evals` and `/pairwise-evals` lack authentication, allowing unauthorized access to evaluation data.
**Trigger Steps**:
1. An attacker accesses `/evals` without credentials.
2. Retrieves internal evaluation results or test data.
**Impact**: Data leakage of evaluation datasets or internal metrics.
**Vulnerability Rank**: High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**: Implement authentication and authorization checks.
**Preconditions**: None.
**Source Code Analysis**:
- No authentication middleware is applied to `/evals` routes in `backend/routes/evals.py`.
**Security Test Case**:
1. Deploy the backend.
2. Send GET requests to `/evals` and observe unprotected access to evaluation data.
