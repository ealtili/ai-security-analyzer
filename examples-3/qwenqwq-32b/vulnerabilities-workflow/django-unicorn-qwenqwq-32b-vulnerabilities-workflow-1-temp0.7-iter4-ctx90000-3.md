# Updated Vulnerabilities in Django Unicorn Project

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Insecure Deserialization of User Data**
- **Description**: The project uses `orjson` for serialization, but improper handling of user-supplied data in components could still lead to unsafe deserialization of complex objects.
- **Impact**: Potential remote code execution (RCE) if malicious data is processed.
- **Steps to Trigger**:
  1. Exploit a component that accepts serialized data without strict validation.
  2. Inject malicious payloads into JSON fields to trigger unsafe execution.
- **Vulnerability Rank**: Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None explicitly enforced.
- **Missing Mitigations**: Proper validation and sanitization of all user-provided data before deserialization.
- **Preconditions**: Components processing unvalidated JSON inputs.
- **Source Code Analysis**:
  - `serializer.py` uses `orjson`, which by itself is secure, but improper handling of untrusted inputs (e.g., allowing arbitrary data types) could bypass built-in safeguards.
  - Example: If a component’s `data` field accepts user input without validating its structure or type, an attacker could inject malicious payloads (e.g., `datetime` or `object_hook` exploits).
- **Security Test Case**:
  ```markdown
  1. Craft a malicious JSON payload with controlled deserialization payloads (e.g., `{"__class__": "datetime.datetime", "year": "os.system('id')", ...}`).
  2. Submit the payload to a component expecting serialized data (e.g., via a POST request to `/unicorn/component/update`).
  3. Monitor for unintended execution (e.g., command execution or data corruption).
  ```

## High-Impact Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Missing CSRF Token in Templates**
- **Description**: Components may lack `{% csrf_token %}` in their templates, enabling cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact**: Attackers can trick users into submitting unauthorized requests.
- **Steps to Trigger**:
  1. Identify a component template without the CSRF token.
  2. Craft a malicious form submission targeting this component.
- **Vulnerability Rank**: High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None explicitly enforced.
- **Missing Mitigations**: Ensuring all component templates include `{% csrf_token %}`.
- **Preconditions**: Templates like `hello-world.html` lack CSRF protection.
- **Source Code Analysis**:
  - Tests in `test_unicorn_template_renders` validate component structure but do not check for CSRF tokens.
- **Security Test Case**:
  ```markdown
  1. Create a form within a component template (e.g., `my-component.html`) without including `{% csrf_token %}`.
  2. Use a forged request (e.g., via JavaScript) to submit the form to the component’s update endpoint.
  3. Observe successful unauthorized data modification.
  ```

### 2. **Path Traversal via Component Loading**
- **Description**: Improper handling of component names allows path traversal when loading modules.
- **Impact**: Attackers could access unintended modules or files.
- **Steps to Trigger**:
  1. Manipulate component names to include paths (e.g., `../../sensitive/component`).
  2. Trigger loading of the maliciously named component.
- **Vulnerability Rank**: High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None explicitly enforced.
- **Missing Mitigations**: Sanitizing component names to block path characters (e.g., `/`, `..`).
- **Preconditions**: Component names derived from user input are unvalidated.
- **Source Code Analysis**:
  - `get_locations` in `test_get_locations.py` may allow traversal if component names include path characters.
- **Security Test Case**:
  ```markdown
  1. Attempt to load a component named `../../../../settings.py` via a crafted URL parameter.
  2. Verify if the system attempts to load the sensitive file path.
  ```

### 3. **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**
- **Description**: Components expose internal model IDs without proper authorization checks.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data via exposed IDs.
- **Steps to Trigger**:
  1. Access a component with an ID pointing to unauthorized data (e.g., another user’s record).
  2. Retrieve or modify the data.
- **Vulnerability Rank**: High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None explicitly enforced.
- **Missing Mitigations**: Implementing access controls to validate user permissions for data access.
- **Preconditions**: Components like `FakeModelComponent` expose `model.id` without checks.
- **Source Code Analysis**:
  - Components such as `FakeModelComponent` directly expose `model.id` in templates.
- **Security Test Case**:
  ```markdown
  1. Obtain another user’s model ID via enumeration or exposure.
  2. Access the component URL with the obtained ID (e.g., `/unicorn/component/{attacker_id}`).
  3. Verify unauthorized data retrieval or modification.
  ```

## Mitigations Summary
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**:
  - **Insecure Deserialization**: Validate and sanitize all user-provided data before deserialization.
- **High-Impact Vulnerabilities**:
  - **Missing CSRF Token**: Add `{% csrf_token %}` to all component templates.
  - **Path Traversal**: Sanitize component names to disallow path characters.
  - **IDOR**: Implement role-based access controls for component data.
