### Vulnerability 1: Arbitrary Code Execution via User-Provided Model File Inclusion (Critical)

**Description**:
The extension includes all PHP files in the configured model directories (e.g., `app`, `app/Models`) when loading Eloquent model metadata. This allows attackers to inject malicious PHP code into model files, which is executed when the extension runs.

**Steps to Trigger**:
1. **Malicious Model File Creation**:
   The attacker creates a malicious model file (e.g., `App/Models/Exploit.php`) containing arbitrary PHP code (e.g., `<?php system('id') ?>`).
2. **Model Directory Access**:
   The attacker ensures the malicious file resides in a directory listed in the extension's `modelsPaths` configuration.
3. **Trigger Execution**:
   When the extension runs `loadModels()`, it iterates over model directories and executes `include_once` on each PHP file, including the malicious file. The PHP code in the file executes, allowing arbitrary commands.

**Impact**:
Full remote code execution (RCE) on the user's machine as the VS Code process runs with user privileges. Attackers can execute commands, access files, or install malware.

**Current Mitigations**:
None. The extension unconditionally includes all PHP files in model directories without validation.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- The extension should parse model files to extract metadata (e.g., class names, methods) instead of executing them.
- Validate and restrict which files are included (e.g., only files with `Model` suffix).
- Use a sandboxed environment to evaluate PHP files.

**Preconditions**:
- The malicious model file is placed in a directory listed in `modelsPaths`.
- The user has the extension enabled.

**Source Code Analysis**:
In `EloquentProvider.ts`:
```typescript
Helpers.runLaravel(
  "foreach (['" + modelsPaths + ... + "'] as $modelPath) {" +
  "   if (is_dir(base_path($modelPath))) {" +
  "      foreach (scandir(...) as $sourceFile) {" +
  "         if (is_file(...)) include_once base_path(...); // executes malicious file
  "      }" +
  "   }" +
);
```

**Security Test Case**:
1. **Malicious Model Setup**:
   Create a malicious model file `App/Models/Exploit.php` with `<?php file_put_contents('/tmp/rce_exploit', 'PWNED'); ?>`.
2. **Configuration**:
   Ensure `modelsPaths` includes the model directory (e.g., default `["app", "app/Models"]`).
3. **Trigger Execution**:
   Open the malicious project in VS Code with the extension enabled. Observe that `/tmp/rce_exploit` is created, confirming RCE.

### Vulnerability 2: Remote Code Execution via Laravel Application Execution (Critical)

**Description**:
The extension boots the user's Laravel application when gathering metadata (e.g., routes, configurations, views). This executes all service providers, middleware, and route definitions, allowing attackers to embed malicious code in these components that runs when the extension initializes.

**Steps to Trigger**:
1. **Malicious Project Setup**:
   The attacker creates a Laravel project with a malicious service provider (e.g., `app/Providers/ExploitServiceProvider.php`) that contains arbitrary PHP code (e.g., `system('id')`).
2. **Service Provider Registration**:
   The attacker registers the provider in `config/app.php`.
3. **Extension Trigger**:
   When the extension initializes (e.g., on opening the project), it runs `runLaravel()`, which bootstraps the Laravel application and executes the malicious provider code.

**Impact**:
Full RCE on the user's machine. Attackers can execute arbitrary commands during Laravel's boot process.

**Current Mitigations**:
None. The extension executes the user's Laravel application without restrictions. A warning is mentioned in the README, but no technical safeguards exist.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- The extension should avoid executing the user's Laravel application. Instead, it should parse metadata without bootstrapping the app.
- Provide an isolated environment (e.g., a Docker container) to run Laravel commands.

**Preconditions**:
- The malicious Laravel project is opened in VS Code with the extension enabled.
- The project contains malicious service providers, routes, or middleware.

**Source Code Analysis**:
In `Helpers.ts`:
```typescript
static runLaravel(code: string, ... ) {
  return new Promise(...);
  // The code requires the user's vendor/autoload.php and bootstrap/app.php,
  // bootstrapping the full Laravel app and executing all startup code.
}
```

**Security Test Case**:
1. **Malicious Service Provider**:
   Create `app/Providers/ExploitServiceProvider.php` with a `boot` method:
   ```php
   public function boot() {
       file_put_contents('/tmp/rce_exploit', 'PWNED');
   }
   ```
2. **Register Provider**:
   Add the provider to `config/app.php` under `providers`.
3. **Trigger Execution**:
   Open the project in VS Code with the extension enabled. Check for `/tmp/rce_exploit`, confirming RCE.

### Vulnerability 3: Path Traversal via basePathForCode Configuration (High)

**Description**:
The `basePathForCode` configuration is used in PHP `require_once` statements to load project files. If an attacker sets this to a malicious path (e.g., `../../malicious_dir`), they can load arbitrary files outside the project directory.

**Steps to Trigger**:
1. **Malicious Configuration**:
   The attacker sets `basePathForCode` to a malicious path (e.g., `../malicious_dir`).
2. **File Inclusion**:
   The extension uses this path in `require_once` calls (e.g., for loading `vendor/autoload.php`), allowing inclusion of external files.

**Impact**:
Execution of arbitrary PHP files from unauthorized directories, leading to RCE if malicious files exist there.

**Current Mitigations**:
None. The configuration is used directly without validation.

**Missing Mitigations**:
- Validate `basePathForCode` to ensure it points to a valid project subdirectory.
- Restrict paths to known-safe directories (e.g., `./vendor/autoload.php`).

**Preconditions**:
- The attacker can configure `basePathForCode` (e.g., via VS Code settings).
- A malicious PHP file exists in the target path.

**Source Code Analysis**:
In `Helpers.ts`:
```typescript
static projectPath(path: string, forCode: boolean = false): string {
  if (forCode) {
    return basePathForCode + path; // Uses basePathForCode directly without validation
  }
}
```

**Security Test Case**:
1. **Malicious Configuration**:
   Set `LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode` to `../malicious_dir`.
2. **Malicious File**:
   Place `malicious_dir/vendor/autoload.php` with `<?php system('echo PWNED > /tmp/exploit') ?>`.
3. **Trigger Execution**:
   The extension loads the malicious file via `require_once`, creating `/tmp/exploit`.
