Here’s the updated list of vulnerabilities that meet the specified criteria (attack vector: malicious code generation via crafted input, excluding DoS/vulnerabilities with low/medium severity):

---

### Vulnerability: **Malicious Code Generation via Unsanitized AI Output**
**Description**:
The backend allows unvalidated code generation from AI models. Attackers can craft malicious inputs (e.g., manipulated screenshots/mocks) to trick the AI into generating harmful code (e.g., XSS scripts, shell commands, or malicious JavaScript). The generated code is directly returned to the frontend without any syntax or semantic validation.

**Impact**:
- **Critical**: Attackers can generate executable code that runs in the user’s browser (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`), leading to data theft, session hijacking, or UI redress attacks.
- Attackers might also inject code that exfiltrates data via hidden API calls or executes arbitrary shell commands if the server-side logic is compromised.

**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

**Preconditions**:
- Attacker provides a malicious input (e.g., a screenshot with hidden payload text).
- The AI model is tricked into generating harmful code (e.g., script tags).

**Source Code Analysis**:
- In `routes/generate_code.py`, the AI’s output is directly returned without validation:
  ```python
  # The AI's output (completion) is directly returned without validation:
  completions = [result["code"] for result in completion_results]
  ```
- The prompt assembly in `prompts/__init__.py` includes raw user-provided images/data URLs, which could be manipulated:
  ```python
  def assemble_prompt(image_data_url, stack, result_image_data_url=None):
      user_content = [
          {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": image_data_url, "detail": "high"}},
          {"type": "text", "text": user_prompt},
      ]
  ```

**Security Test Case**:
1. Send a crafted screenshot containing text like `generate <script>alert('XSS')</script>` to the `/generate-code` endpoint.
2. The AI may generate code with the script tag.
3. The frontend renders the code via `innerHTML`, executing the script in the browser and triggering an alert.

### Vulnerability: **Insecure Image Generation Leading to XSS**
**Description**:
The `generate_images` function in `image_generation/core.py` replaces placeholder images but doesn’t validate or sanitize external image URLs. Attackers could trick the AI to include malicious `<img>` tags with data URLs (e.g., `data:image/svg+xml...`) that execute scripts.

**Impact**:
- **High**: Malicious image sources could trigger XSS or SVG-based attacks, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user’s browser.

**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Preconditions**:
- Attacker provides an input that makes the AI generate code with an `<img>` tag pointing to a malicious data URL (e.g., `data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2Zy...`).

**Source Code Analysis**:
- The `generate_images` function ignores non-placehold.co images, leaving them unvalidated:
  ```python
  def generate_images(code, ...):
      # Only process images from placehold.co, others remain unchanged.
      if not img["src"].startswith("https://placehold.co"):
          continue
  ```

**Security Test Case**:
1. Craft an input causing the AI to generate:
   ```html
   <img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB...">
   ```
2. The image is rendered in the browser, executing embedded payloads.

### Final List Rationale:
- **API Key Exposure** (High severity) was excluded because it does not directly relate to the attack vector of *crafted input leading to malicious code generation*.
- **Rate Limiting** (Medium severity) was excluded due to being a DoS vulnerability.
- **User-Provided Prompts** (Medium severity) was excluded due to its medium severity ranking.

The remaining vulnerabilities directly enable attackers to generate malicious code via crafted inputs, aligning with the specified attack vector.
