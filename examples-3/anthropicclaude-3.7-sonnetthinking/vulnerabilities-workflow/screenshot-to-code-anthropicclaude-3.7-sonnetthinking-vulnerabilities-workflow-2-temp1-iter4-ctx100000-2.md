# Vulnerabilities in screenshot-to-code

Based on the evaluation criteria, I need to exclude the provided Local File Inclusion vulnerability since it is rated as Medium severity. The instructions specifically require only including vulnerabilities of high or critical severity.

While this is a legitimate security issue (allowing arbitrary file paths as query parameters without proper validation), its impact is limited to reading HTML files only, which justifies the Medium severity rating given.
