Based on the information provided, I need to evaluate whether the "Unauthorized Method Access via AJAX" vulnerability meets all criteria for inclusion in the list.

While the test files you've reviewed confirm that Django-Unicorn allows calling public methods via AJAX requests (which could potentially be exploited), the information provided doesn't include:

1. Detailed source code analysis showing exactly how the vulnerability can be triggered
2. Specific security test case with step-by-step instructions demonstrating the exploit
3. Clear evidence of high or critical severity impact (rather than theoretical concerns)
4. Concrete examples of how an attacker could exploit this in a real-world scenario

Without these specific details required by the criteria, I cannot include this vulnerability in the final list. The requirement states that vulnerabilities must be "completely described" with source code analysis and security test cases, which are missing from the current description.
