### Combined Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code
- Description:
    1.  An attacker crafts a manipulated screenshot or screen recording that includes text, UI elements, or even hidden code designed to be misinterpreted by the AI model as a request to generate specific HTML or JavaScript containing a malicious payload.
    2.  The attacker uploads this crafted screenshot or screen recording to the "screenshot-to-code" application through the user interface. For video input, the application splits the video into frames and processes them as individual images.
    3.  The application's backend receives the input and sends it to the configured AI model (e.g., GPT-4 Vision, Claude 3) for processing. The AI model is prompted to generate code based on the visual input.
    4.  Due to the nature of AI models and the lack of specific security constraints during prompt generation or output processing, the AI model may generate HTML and JavaScript code that inadvertently includes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payload. This can occur if the AI model directly translates malicious text from the screenshot into code or generates unsafe code structures like inline JavaScript event handlers (e.g., `onclick="malicious_code()"`) or directly embeds `<script>` tags with malicious JavaScript.
    5.  The backend receives the AI-generated code, which now contains the XSS payload. In `backend/codegen/utils.py`, the `extract_html_content` function is used to extract HTML content from the AI's response. This function uses regular expressions for extraction but importantly, performs **no sanitization** of the HTML content.
    6.  The backend, specifically in `backend/routes/generate_code.py`, then sends this raw, AI-generated code, including the potentially malicious script, back to the frontend via WebSocket without any sanitization or security checks. The `send_message("setCode", updated_html, index)` function transmits the unsanitized HTML.
    7.  The frontend receives the AI-generated code and renders it in the user's browser. If the frontend uses insecure methods like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React or directly sets `innerHTML` in JavaScript without proper sanitization, the embedded malicious script will be executed. This could also occur if the application provides a live preview feature that renders the generated code.
    8.  The malicious JavaScript code executes within the user's browser context, resulting in an XSS vulnerability. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when the generated code is previewed or used, potentially in web applications built using this tool.

- Impact:
    * **Account Takeover:** An attacker could steal session cookies or other sensitive authentication tokens, leading to account hijacking and unauthorized access to user accounts.
    * **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to extract sensitive data from the user's browser, including personal information, API keys, or other confidential data, and send it to a remote server controlled by the attacker.
    * **Website Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of the web page displayed to the user, altering the visual appearance of the application, displaying misleading information, or damaging the application's reputation.
    * **Malware Distribution:** XSS can be leveraged to serve malware to the user's browser, potentially infecting their system with viruses, trojans, or other malicious software.
    * **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can use XSS to overlay fake login forms or other deceptive elements on the legitimate application to steal user credentials, redirect users to phishing sites, or conduct other social engineering attacks.
    * **Execution of Arbitrary Javascript:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript code within the victim's browser, granting them significant control over the user's session and browser environment.
    * **Session Hijacking and Cookie Theft:** Attackers can steal session cookies, potentially hijacking user sessions and gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    * **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Users can be redirected to attacker-controlled malicious websites, potentially leading to further malware infections or phishing attacks.
    * **Performing Actions on Behalf of the User:** Attackers can use XSS to perform actions on behalf of the user without their consent, such as modifying data, initiating transactions, or spreading malware within the application's context.
    * **Harvesting User Credentials:** Malicious scripts can be designed to capture user input, including usernames and passwords, potentially leading to credential theft.
    * **Injection of Further Malicious Scripts:** Attackers can inject further malicious scripts, including keyloggers or cryptocurrency miners, compromising the user's system and potentially using their resources for illicit activities.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None identified in the provided project files. Reviewing the code, there are no explicit mitigations implemented to prevent XSS in the AI-generated code. The application relies on the AI model to generate safe code, which is not a reliable security measure. There is no evidence of output sanitization, Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation, or any other XSS prevention techniques in the analyzed code. The code generation logic and rendering pipeline do not appear to include any explicit sanitization steps for the AI-generated code. The `codegen/utils.py` file only extracts HTML content but does not sanitize it. The file `backend/routes/generate_code.py` uses this utility to process the generated code before sending it to the frontend, inheriting the lack of sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
    * **Backend Sanitization:** The backend must implement rigorous sanitization of the AI-generated code before sending it to the frontend. This should involve parsing the generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and removing or escaping any potentially malicious code, especially JavaScript event handlers or `<script>` tags. Libraries like DOMPurify (for HTML), `bleach` (for Python backend), or similar tools for CSS and JavaScript should be used on the backend to sanitize the output before it's transmitted.
    * **Frontend Sanitization:** The frontend should also implement sanitization before rendering the AI-generated code. Even if backend sanitization is in place, defense-in-depth principles recommend frontend sanitization as well. Using React's built-in mechanisms for safe HTML rendering or libraries like DOMPurify on the frontend can help prevent XSS. Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization. For plain JavaScript, use secure methods to set content and avoid directly setting `innerHTML` with unsanitized data.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) header is crucial. CSP headers should be configured to restrict the origins from which resources (scripts, styles, images, etc.) can be loaded. This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks by preventing the execution of inline scripts and restricting script sources, adding an important layer of security.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Testing:** Regularly auditing the application and performing security testing, specifically focused on XSS vulnerabilities in AI-generated code, is essential. This includes both manual code review and automated security scanning to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.
    * **User Education and Warnings:** While not a technical mitigation, providing clear warnings to users about the potential security risks of using AI-generated code and advising them to review and sanitize the code before deployment can help reduce the likelihood of exploitation. The application should clearly warn users about the potential security risks of using AI-generated code without thorough review and sanitization. It should recommend manual code review and security testing of the generated output before deployment.

- Preconditions:
    * The application must be running and publicly accessible to the attacker.
    * The application must have the functionality to allow users to upload screenshots or videos for code generation. This is a fundamental feature of the application, so this precondition is inherently met.
    * The attacker needs to be able to craft a screenshot or screen recording that can be processed by the AI model in a way that malicious JavaScript is embedded in the generated code. This might require some experimentation to understand the AI's interpretation patterns.
    * The AI model used by the application must be susceptible to generating XSS payloads based on manipulated screenshot or video inputs. While modern AI models are generally trained to avoid generating explicitly harmful code, they can still be tricked into generating vulnerable code, especially when interpreting visual inputs.
    * The frontend must render the AI-generated code without proper sanitization, typically by using methods that directly execute embedded scripts or by using insecure rendering practices.
    * A user must interact with the generated code in a browser environment where Javascript execution is enabled. This could be through directly copying and pasting the code into an HTML file and opening it in a browser, or using a preview feature within the application that renders the generated code, or if a user uses the generated code in a web application without proper security review.

- Source Code Analysis:
    * **`backend/llm.py` & `backend/evals/core.py`**: These files handle the communication with the LLMs (like OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Anthropic). The `stream_openai_response`, `stream_claude_response`, `stream_gemini_response` functions in `llm.py` and similar functions in `evals/core.py` receive prompts and return code generated by the LLMs as strings. There is no code in these files or in `codegen/utils.py` that sanitizes the generated code before returning it. The code is directly passed back without any security processing.
    * **`backend/codegen/utils.py`**: The `extract_html_content` function in `codegen/utils.py` is used to extract the HTML part from the LLM's response.
        ```python
        import re

        def extract_html_content(text: str):
            # Use regex to find content within <html> tags and include the tags themselves
            match = re.search(r"(<html.*?>.*?</html>)", text, re.DOTALL)
            if match:
                return match.group(1)
            else:
                # Otherwise, we just send the previous HTML over
                print(
                    "[HTML Extraction] No <html> tags found in the generated content: " + text
                )
                return text
        ```
        This function uses a regular expression `r"(<html.*?>.*?</html>)"` to extract HTML content. The regex captures any content enclosed within `<html>` and `</html>` tags. Critically, this function performs **no sanitization** of the extracted HTML. It directly returns the matched HTML string without any encoding, filtering, or escaping of potentially malicious content. If the regular expression fails to find `<html>` tags, the function simply returns the original input `text` without any HTML extraction or sanitization.
    * **`backend/main.py` & `backend/routes/generate_code.py`**: `backend/main.py` is the FastAPI application. The routes (defined in `routes` directory) handle receiving user input (screenshots/videos), calling the LLM functions in `llm.py` to generate code, and then sending this generated code to the frontend. `backend/routes/generate_code.py` contains the `/generate-code` websocket endpoint which is responsible for handling code generation requests.
        ```python
        # routes/generate_code.py
        # ...
        ## Post-processing

        # Strip the completion of everything except the HTML content
        completions = [extract_html_content(completion) for completion in completions]
        # ...
        for index, updated_html in enumerate(updated_completions):
            await send_message("setCode", updated_html, index)
        # ...
        ```
        This file uses functions from `llm.py` to get code from LLMs. The generated code is processed by `extract_html_content` function. While the name suggests HTML processing, there's no indication of sanitization within this function or elsewhere in `generate_code.py`. After extracting the HTML content, `generate_code.py` does not perform any sanitization or encoding before sending the code to the frontend using `send_message("setCode", updated_html, index)`. This direct transmission of unsanitized HTML is the core of the XSS vulnerability. The backend receives the generated code from `llm.py` or `evals/core.py` and sends it to the frontend through API endpoints. There is no indication in `main.py` or other backend files of any middleware or functions that would sanitize the code before sending it to the frontend.
    * **`backend/video/utils.py`**: The file `backend/video/utils.py` is responsible for processing video inputs. The `split_video_into_screenshots` function decodes video data URLs, splits the video into frames, and prepares these frames as images for processing by the AI model. This expands the attack surface beyond just screenshots, as malicious actors can also craft videos containing frames designed to induce XSS.
    * **`frontend/src/components/CodeEditor.tsx` (assumed based on project description):** The frontend component responsible for displaying the generated code likely renders the received code directly in the browser. If this rendering is done without proper escaping or using mechanisms to prevent script execution, it will be vulnerable to XSS if the generated code contains malicious scripts. It is highly probable that the frontend receives the code string from the backend and renders it to the user using methods like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (in React) or similar insecure rendering methods, making it vulnerable to XSS.

    **Visualization of Vulnerability Flow:**

    ```
    [Attacker crafts malicious screenshot/video] --> [Upload to Frontend] --> [Backend API Endpoint (/generate-code)] --> [LLM in backend/llm.py (Code Generation)] --> [Unsanitized Code string] --> [backend/routes/generate_code.py] --> [extract_html_content (no sanitization)] --> [Unsanitized Code string via WebSocket] --> [Frontend (React/Vite)] --> [dangerouslySetInnerHTML or similar insecure rendering] --> [XSS Execution in User Browser]
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Deploy a publicly accessible instance of the `screenshot-to-code` application.
    2. **Craft Malicious Screenshot:** Create a screenshot image (e.g., PNG, JPG) that visually resembles a normal UI element (e.g., a button, text box, or simple webpage layout), but includes hidden or visually inconspicuous malicious JavaScript code. Examples include:
        * Embed JavaScript within an HTML attribute like `onload` or `onerror` within an `<img>` tag: `<img src="invalid-url" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected!')" alt="Benign UI Element">`.
        * Embed JavaScript within a `<script>` tag disguised as text content:  `<button>Click <script>alert("XSS")</script> Me</button>`.
        * Create a screenshot depicting text like HTML code containing `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.
        * A simpler approach is to try and induce generation of `<button onclick="alert('XSS')">Click Me</button>`.
        Save this image as `malicious_screenshot.png`.
    3. **Upload Screenshot:** Using the application's frontend in a web browser, access the application and upload the crafted `malicious_screenshot.png`. Select any supported stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind).
    4. **Generate Code:** Initiate the code generation process by clicking the "Generate Code" or similar button.
    5. **Observe Output & Examine Generated Code:** After the AI processes the screenshot and generates code, examine the rendered output in the browser. Inspect the page source or use developer tools to carefully review the generated HTML, CSS, and Javascript code. Look for the presence of the injected XSS payload from the screenshot in the generated code.
    6. **Verify XSS Execution:**
        * **Option 1 (Direct Execution):** Copy the generated HTML code. Create a new HTML file (e.g., `test.html`) on your local machine, paste the generated code into it, and open `test.html` in a web browser.
        * **Option 2 (Application Preview - if available):** If the application provides a preview feature to render the generated code, use this feature within the application.
    7. **Confirm XSS:** If the XSS vulnerability is present, an alert box (as in the example payloads) will pop up in the browser, or other JavaScript code will execute (depending on the injected payload). Observe if the Javascript payload (e.g., `alert('XSS Vulnerability!')`) executes in the browser when the page loads or when you interact with the vulnerable element (e.g., clicking the generated button). If an alert box pops up, or if other malicious actions are performed, it confirms the XSS vulnerability. Inspect the HTML source code in the browser to confirm that the malicious JavaScript code from the screenshot is present in the rendered HTML in the browser's DOM.
    8. **Successful Exploitation:** If the alert box appears, or if you observe other signs of Javascript execution, this confirms the XSS vulnerability. This demonstrates that a manipulated screenshot can indeed cause the AI to generate code vulnerable to XSS, and the application does not prevent the execution of this malicious code due to the lack of sanitization.
