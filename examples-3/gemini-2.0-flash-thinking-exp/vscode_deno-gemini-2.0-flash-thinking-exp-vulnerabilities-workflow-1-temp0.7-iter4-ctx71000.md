### Combined Vulnerability List

#### 1. VSCode Extension Settings Injection leading to Command Injection in Deno Test Task

- **Vulnerability Name:** VSCode Extension Settings Injection leading to Command Injection in Deno Test Task
- **Description:**
    1. Attacker creates a malicious repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    2. In `.vscode/settings.json`, attacker injects malicious commands into `deno.codeLens.testArgs` or `deno.testing.args`.
    3. Victim clones and opens the malicious repository in VSCode with the vscode-deno extension.
    4. Victim runs a Deno test using code lens or test explorer.
    5. VSCode applies settings from `.vscode/settings.json`, including malicious arguments.
    6. The `deno test` command is executed with injected arguments, leading to command injection.
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). Attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The extension directly uses the settings values without sanitization.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Sanitize and validate `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args` settings to prevent command injection.
    - Consider whitelisting allowed arguments or disallowing arguments that can introduce new commands (e.g., arguments starting with `-`, `--`, `;`, `&`, etc.).
- **Preconditions:**
    1. VSCode with vscode-deno extension installed and enabled.
    2. Victim opens a malicious repository containing crafted `.vscode/settings.json`.
    3. Victim runs a Deno test using code lens or test explorer in the malicious repository.
- **Source code analysis:**
    - File: `client\src\commands.ts`, function `test()`
    - The `testArgs` are retrieved from `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs")` without sanitization.
    - These `testArgs` are directly included in the `args` array for `ProcessExecution`, leading to potential command injection.
- **Security test case:**
    1. Create a directory `vscode_deno_test_vuln`.
    2. Create `.vscode/settings.json` with:
       ```json
       {
           "deno.codeLens.testArgs": ["; echo PWNED ;"]
       }
       ```
    3. Create `test.ts` with:
       ```typescript
       import { assertEquals } from "https://deno.land/std@0.218.2/assert/mod.ts";
       Deno.test("test example", () => { assertEquals(1, 1); });
       ```
    4. Open `vscode_deno_test_vuln` in VSCode with vscode-deno extension enabled.
    5. Open `test.ts`, click "â–¶ Run Test" code lens.
    6. Check "Tasks - Deno" output panel. If "PWNED" is printed, command injection is successful.

#### 2. Command Injection via Malicious `.env` File

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Malicious `.env` File
- **Description:**
    1. A threat actor crafts a malicious repository.
    2. Within this repository, the attacker creates a `.env` file containing specially crafted content designed to exploit potential vulnerabilities.
    3. A victim, with the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension installed, opens this malicious repository in VSCode.
    4. The extension, upon activation or when certain commands are executed, reads the `deno.envFile` setting from the VSCode configuration. If configured to point to a `.env` file within the workspace (or defaults to a workspace-relative path), the extension attempts to load environment variables from this file.
    5. The extension uses `fs.readFileSync` to read the content of the `.env` file and then utilizes `dotenv.parse()` to parse this content into environment variables.
    6. If the malicious `.env` file is crafted to exploit a vulnerability in `dotenv.parse()` function, or if the Deno CLI or its dependencies are vulnerable to environment variable injection, it could lead to code injection or command execution.
    7. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code within the context of the VSCode extension or the Deno CLI, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the victim's machine.

- **Impact:** Code Injection, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). If exploited, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine when they open a malicious repository in VSCode.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The current code directly reads and parses the `.env` file content using `dotenv.parse` without any input validation or sanitization.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization of the `.env` file content before it is parsed by `dotenv.parse()`. This could involve checks for malicious patterns, excessively long strings, or unexpected characters.
    - Consider using a more secure or sandboxed environment for parsing `.env` files to limit the impact of potential code injection vulnerabilities.
    - Implement least privilege principles by restricting the operations that can be performed using environment variables loaded from `.env` files.
    - Conduct a thorough security audit of the `dotenv.parse()` library and Deno CLI to identify any known or potential code injection vulnerabilities when handling untrusted input and environment variables. Regularly update the `dotenv` library and Deno CLI to patch any discovered vulnerabilities.
- **Preconditions:**
    1. The victim must have the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension installed in VSCode.
    2. The victim must open a malicious repository provided by the attacker in VSCode.
    3. The `deno.envFile` setting must be configured to point to a `.env` file within the malicious repository, or rely on a default behavior that causes the extension to parse a `.env` file in the workspace root.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The vulnerability is located in the `client\src\commands.ts` file within the `startLanguageServer` function.
    - Code Snippet:
    ```typescript
    const denoEnvFile = config.get<string>("envFile");
    if (denoEnvFile) {
      if (workspaceFolder) {
        const denoEnvPath = path.join(workspaceFolder.uri.fsPath, denoEnvFile);
        try {
          const content = fs.readFileSync(denoEnvPath, { encoding: "utf8" });
          const parsed = dotenv.parse(content); // Potential Code Injection Vulnerability
          Object.assign(env, parsed);
        } catch (error) {
          vscode.window.showErrorMessage(
            `Could not read env file "${denoEnvPath}": ${error}`,
          );
        }
      }
    }
    const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
      run: {
        command,
        args: ["lsp"],
        options: { env }, // Malicious env is passed to child process here
      },
      debug: {
        command,
        args: ["lsp"],
        options: { env }, // Malicious env is passed to child process here
      },
    };
    ```
    - The line `const parsed = dotenv.parse(content);` is the point where code injection could be triggered through vulnerabilities in `dotenv.parse()`. Additionally, the `env` object is passed to `child_process.spawn` which might be vulnerable to environment variable injection in Deno CLI.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a new directory as a malicious repository.
        - Inside, create a file named `.env`.
    2. **Craft Malicious .env Content:**
        - In `.env`, insert content to exploit potential code injection in `dotenv.parse()` or environment variable injection in Deno CLI. Example for testing environment variable injection (Linux/macOS):
        ```env
        MALICIOUS_VAR='() { ignored; }; touch /tmp/pwned'
        ```
    3. **Open Malicious Repository in VSCode:**
        - Open the directory as a workspace in VSCode.
    4. **Configure `deno.envFile` (if necessary):**
        - Ensure `deno.envFile` is set to `.env` in workspace settings.
    5. **Trigger Extension Activity:**
        - Open a `.ts` or `.js` file to activate the Deno language server.
    6. **Observe and Verify:**
        - Check if `/tmp/pwned` is created after extension initialization, indicating command injection via `.env` file.

#### 3. Command Injection via `deno.path` setting

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via `deno.path` setting
- **Description:**
    1. The VSCode Deno extension allows users to configure the path to the Deno executable using the `deno.path` setting.
    2. A malicious user can craft a repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets `deno.path` to a malicious executable path containing command injection sequences.
    3. When a victim opens this repository in VSCode and the Deno extension is enabled, the extension will attempt to execute the Deno CLI using the provided malicious path.
    4. If the malicious path contains command injection sequences, these sequences will be executed by the system when the extension tries to start the Deno Language Server or run any Deno commands.
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the victim's machine. An attacker can gain complete control over the victim's system.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The extension attempts to resolve `deno` executable from the environment path if `deno.path` is not set.
    - The extension checks if the provided path exists and is a file using `fs.stat`. This check is insufficient to prevent command injection.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization and validation for the `deno.path` setting to prevent command injection. Ensure the path does not contain shell metacharacters or command separators.
    - Use `child_process.spawn` with `shell: false` when executing the Deno CLI.
- **Preconditions:**
    1. Victim has VSCode installed with the Deno extension.
    2. Victim opens a malicious repository in VSCode.
    3. Deno extension is enabled for the workspace.
    4. Attacker can create a repository with a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`client\src\util.ts` - `getDenoCommandPath()`:** Retrieves Deno command path, ultimately from `deno.path` setting.
    2. **`client\src\util.ts` - `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`:** Retrieves `deno.path` setting from VSCode configuration without sanitization.
    3. **`client\src\commands.ts` - `startLanguageServer()`:** Uses `getDenoCommandPath()` to get the command and executes it via `LanguageClient`.
    - **Visualization:**
    ```
    User Input (deno.path in .vscode/settings.json) --> getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() --> getDenoCommandPath() --> startLanguageServer() --> LanguageClient (executes command) --> Command Injection
    ```
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a directory `malicious-repo`.
    2. Inside, create `.vscode/settings.json` with malicious `deno.path` (Windows example):
        ```json
        {
          "deno.path": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c calc.exe && C:\\Windows\\System32\\deno.exe"
        }
        ```
    3. Open `malicious-repo` in VSCode.
    4. Enable Deno extension.
    5. Observe calculator execution when Deno extension starts language server, indicating command injection.

#### 4. Command Injection via Deno Task Definitions

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Deno Task Definitions
- **Description:**
    1. The VSCode Deno extension allows defining tasks in `tasks.json` or `deno.json` configuration files.
    2. A malicious user can create a repository with a crafted `tasks.json` or `deno.json` file that contains malicious commands in the `command` or `args` properties of a task definition.
    3. When a victim opens this repository in VSCode and interacts with tasks, the extension will execute the defined tasks.
    4. If the `command` or `args` in the task definition contain command injection sequences, these sequences will be executed by the system when the task is run.
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the victim's machine. An attacker can gain control over the victim's system.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None specific in the Deno extension. Relies on VSCode's task execution framework, which does not sanitize task definitions from workspace files.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization and validation for task `command` and `args` properties in `tasks.json` and `deno.json` files.
    - Use `child_process.spawn` with `shell: false` when executing tasks.
- **Preconditions:**
    1. Victim has VSCode installed with the Deno extension.
    2. Victim opens a malicious repository in VSCode.
    3. Victim interacts with task features (task sidebar, code lens task execution).
    4. Attacker can create a repository with malicious `tasks.json` or `deno.json` file.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`client\src\tasks.ts` - `buildDenoTask()`:** Constructs `vscode.Task` object using `ProcessExecution` with potentially unsanitized `process` and `args`.
    2. **`client\src\tasks.ts` - `DenoTaskProvider.resolveTask()` and `provideTasks()`:** Parse task definitions from `tasks.json` and `deno.json`.
    - **Visualization:**
    ```
    Malicious Task Definition (tasks.json/deno.json) --> DenoTaskProvider (parses tasks) --> buildDenoTask() --> ProcessExecution (executes command and args) --> Command Injection
    ```
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a directory `malicious-task-repo`.
    2. Inside, create `.vscode/tasks.json` with malicious task definition (Windows example):
        ```json
        {
          "version": "2.0.0",
          "tasks": [
            {
              "type": "deno",
              "command": "run",
              "args": [
                "-A",
                "-c",
                "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c calc.exe"
              ],
              "label": "Malicious Task"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
    3. Open `malicious-task-repo` in VSCode.
    4. Open Task sidebar, find "Malicious Task", and run it.
    5. Observe calculator execution, indicating command injection via task definition.
