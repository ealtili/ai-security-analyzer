### Vulnerability List

- #### Command Injection via `phpCommand` configuration

    *   **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via `phpCommand` configuration
    *   **Description:**
        1.  The "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension allows users to configure the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting, which defines the command used to execute PHP code. This setting is intended for customization, allowing users to specify commands for different environments like Docker or Laravel Sail.
        2.  The extension uses `child_process.exec` to execute commands, inserting dynamically generated PHP code into the configured `phpCommand` template at the `{code}` placeholder.
        3.  Crucially, the extension does not perform sufficient sanitization or validation of the user-provided `phpCommand` setting itself.
        4.  A malicious actor can craft a Laravel repository containing a `.vscode/settings.json` file that overrides the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting with a malicious command. This command can include arbitrary shell instructions alongside the intended PHP execution.
        5.  When a victim opens this malicious repository in VSCode with the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension installed and activated, and triggers any extension feature that executes PHP code (e.g., autocompletion, code analysis), the extension will use the attacker-controlled `phpCommand`.
        6.  As a result, the injected shell commands within the malicious `phpCommand` setting will be executed on the victim's machine, leading to command injection and potential Remote Code Execution.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to severe consequences, including:
            *   **Full System Compromise:** Attackers can gain complete control over the victim's system.
            *   **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data and source code can be stolen.
            *   **Malware Installation:** The system can be infected with malware, ransomware, or other malicious software.
            *   **Lateral Movement:** Compromised systems can be used to attack other systems on the network.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** critical

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        *   None. The extension directly retrieves and uses the `phpCommand` setting from the VSCode configuration without any sanitization or validation of the `commandTemplate` itself. While the extension performs some escaping of double quotes and shell-sensitive characters within the `{code}` placeholder (the PHP code generated by the extension), this is insufficient to prevent command injection when the entire command structure is user-configurable and unsanitized.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   **Input Sanitization and Validation for `phpCommand`:** The extension must implement robust sanitization and validation of the `phpCommand` setting. This should include:
            *   **Strict Allowlist/Denylist:** Restricting allowed characters or command structures within the `phpCommand` setting.
            *   **Command Parsing:** Validating that the command begins with a safe executable (e.g., `php`) and does not contain shell metacharacters or command separators.
            *   **Escaping Shell Metacharacters:** Properly escaping shell metacharacters in the `phpCommand` setting before executing it with `child_process.exec`.
        *   **Secure Command Execution Methods:**
            *   **Avoid `child_process.exec`:**  `child_process.exec` directly executes a string as a shell command, making it inherently vulnerable.  Consider using safer alternatives like `child_process.spawn`.
            *   **Parameterization with `spawn`:** When using `child_process.spawn`, construct the command and arguments as separate parameters to prevent shell interpretation of metacharacters within arguments.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege and Sandboxing:**
            *   **Sandboxed Execution:** If feasible, execute PHP commands within a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of successful command injection.
            *   **Minimize Privileges:** Run the command execution with the minimum necessary privileges.
        *   **User Awareness and Warnings:**
            *   **Security Warning in Settings:** Display a clear warning message within the extension's settings UI when users modify the `phpCommand` setting, explicitly highlighting the security risks associated with executing untrusted commands.
            *   **Documentation and Best Practices:** Provide clear documentation advising users on the security implications of modifying `phpCommand`, recommending secure configurations, and warning against including shell commands or pipes.
            *   **Workspace Trust:** Leverage VSCode's Workspace Trust feature to warn users when opening workspaces from untrusted sources that may contain malicious settings.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        *   **Victim Installs Extension:** The victim must have the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension installed in VSCode.
        *   **Victim Opens Malicious Repository:** The victim must open a malicious Laravel repository in VSCode.
        *   **Malicious Workspace Settings:** The malicious repository must contain a `.vscode/settings.json` file that overrides the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting with a malicious command.
        *   **Extension Activation and Feature Trigger:** The extension must be activated within the workspace (typically by opening a PHP or Blade file), and a feature that triggers PHP code execution must be initiated (e.g., autocompletion, code analysis, etc.).

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        *   **File:** `src/helpers.ts`
        *   **Function:** `runPhp(code: string, description: string|null = null)`
        *   ```typescript
            static async runPhp(code: string, description: string|null = null) : Promise<string> {
                code = code.replace(/\"/g, "\\\""); // Line 270: Escapes double quotes in the PHP code.
                if (['linux', 'openbsd', 'sunos', 'darwin'].some(unixPlatforms => os.platform().includes(unixPlatforms))) {
                    code = code.replace(/\$/g, "\\$");
                    code = code.replace(/\\\\'/g, '\\\\\\\\\'');
                    code = code.replace(/\\\\"/g, '\\\\\\\\\"');
                }
                let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\""; // Line 276: Retrieves phpCommand from configuration or uses default.
                let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code); // Line 277: Replaces {code} placeholder.
                let out = new Promise<string>(function (resolve, error) {
                    if (description != null) {
                        Helpers.outputChannel?.info("Laravel Extra Intellisense command started: " + description);
                    }

                    cp.exec(command, // Line 284: Executes the constructed command using child_process.exec. VULNERABLE LINE
                        { cwd: vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders && vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders.length > 0 ? vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0].uri.fsPath : undefined },
                        function (err, stdout, stderr) {
                            // ... command execution handling ...
                        }
                    );
                });
                return out;
            }
            ```
        *   **Explanation:**
            *   **Line 276:** `let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";`
                - Retrieves the `phpCommand` setting from VSCode configuration. This setting is user-configurable and directly used as a command template. If no setting is configured, it defaults to `"php -r \"{code}\""`.
            *   **Line 277:** `let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);`
                - Constructs the final command string by replacing the `{code}` placeholder in the `commandTemplate` with the `$code` argument, which contains PHP code generated by the extension.
            *   **Line 284:** `cp.exec(command, ...)`
                - Executes the command string using `child_process.exec`. This function executes the entire `command` string as a shell command.
            *   **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the direct use of the user-configurable `phpCommand` without any validation or sanitization. By manipulating the `phpCommand` setting, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands that will be executed when the extension calls `cp.exec`. The escaping performed on the `$code` variable is insufficient as it does not sanitize the `commandTemplate` itself.

        *   **Visualization:**

            ```mermaid
            graph LR
                A[VSCode Configuration] --> B{Get phpCommand Setting};
                B --> C[Construct Command Template];
                C --> D{Replace {code} Placeholder};
                D --> E[Execute Command with cp.exec];
                E --> F[System Command Execution];
            ```

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  **Setup:**
            *   Create a new directory named `laravel-vuln-test`.
            *   Inside `laravel-vuln-test`, create a basic Laravel project (you can use `laravel new test-app`).  Alternatively, any directory will suffice as long as VSCode can open it as a workspace.
            *   Open the `laravel-vuln-test` folder in VSCode.
            *   Install the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension in VSCode.
        2.  **Malicious Configuration:**
            *   Inside the `laravel-vuln-test` directory, create a folder named `.vscode`.
            *   Inside the `.vscode` folder, create a file named `settings.json`.
            *   Add the following JSON configuration to `settings.json` to set a malicious `phpCommand`. This example injects a command to create a file `/tmp/vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-pwned` on Linux/macOS, or `%TEMP%\vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-pwned.txt` on Windows:

                **Linux/macOS `.vscode/settings.json`:**
                ```json
                {
                    "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}; touch /tmp/vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-pwned\""
                }
                ```

                **Windows `.vscode/settings.json`:**
                ```json
                {
                    "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}; echo pwned > %TEMP%\\vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-pwned.txt\""
                }
                ```
        3.  **Trigger Autocompletion (or any extension feature):**
            *   Open any PHP file in your Laravel project (e.g., `routes/web.php`). If you don't have a Laravel project, create a new PHP file in the workspace root.
            *   Type `Route::get('test', function () { ` and place the cursor after the opening curly brace `{`.  Alternatively, simply open a Blade file.
            *   Type `config(` or any other Laravel function that triggers autocompletion suggestions. This action will trigger the extension to execute a PHP command.
        4.  **Verify Command Injection:**
            *   **Linux/macOS:** Check if the file `/tmp/vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-pwned` has been created using the terminal command `ls /tmp/vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-pwned`.
            *   **Windows:** Check if the file `%TEMP%\vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-pwned.txt` has been created. You can check the directory specified by the `%TEMP%` environment variable (usually `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Temp`).
        5.  **Expected Result:**
            *   The file `/tmp/vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-pwned` (or `%TEMP%\vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-pwned.txt` on Windows) should be created. This indicates that the `touch` (or `echo`) command injected via the `phpCommand` setting was successfully executed, confirming the command injection vulnerability.


- #### Code Injection via `basePathForCode`

    *   **Vulnerability Name:** Code Injection via `basePathForCode`
    *   **Description:**
        1.  The "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension allows users to configure the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode` setting. This setting is intended to allow users to specify the base path for their Laravel project when it's not automatically detected, for example, in complex project setups or when using custom project structures.
        2.  The extension uses this `basePathForCode` setting to construct file paths to crucial Laravel bootstrap files, specifically `vendor/autoload.php` and `bootstrap/app.php`.
        3.  These files are then included using `require_once` within the extension's code execution context.
        4.  A malicious actor can craft a Laravel repository and include a `.vscode/settings.json` file that overrides the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode` setting to point to a directory within the malicious repository controlled by the attacker.
        5.  The attacker can then place malicious versions of `vendor/autoload.php` or `bootstrap/app.php` in the directory specified by the malicious `basePathForCode`.
        6.  When the victim opens this malicious repository in VSCode and the extension attempts to bootstrap Laravel by including these files using `require_once` with paths derived from the attacker-controlled `basePathForCode`, the malicious PHP code within the attacker's files will be executed within the extension's context.
        7.  This allows for arbitrary PHP code injection into the extension's execution environment.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) / Code Injection:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code within the extension's context. This can lead to:
            *   **VSCode Environment Compromise:**  Attackers can potentially gain control over the VSCode environment and access sensitive information within VSCode.
            *   **Further Exploitation:**  Code execution within the extension context could be leveraged to further exploit the VSCode environment, the victim's system, or other extensions.
            *   **Data Theft:**  Attackers might be able to access and exfiltrate sensitive data from the workspace or the victim's machine.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** high

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        *   None. The extension directly uses the `basePathForCode` setting to construct file paths and uses `require_once` without any validation of the path or the content of the included files.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization for `basePathForCode`:** The extension should rigorously validate and sanitize the `basePathForCode` setting to prevent path traversal and ensure that it points to a valid and expected project directory. This should include:
            *   **Path Traversal Prevention:**  Sanitize the `basePathForCode` to prevent directory traversal attempts (e.g., using `..` to escape the intended project directory).
            *   **Path Validation:** Verify that the `basePathForCode` points to a valid directory within the workspace and ideally restrict it to be within the workspace root.
        *   **Restricting `require_once` Paths:**
            *   **Workspace-Relative Paths:** Ensure that `require_once` only loads files from trusted locations within the workspace, ideally relative to the workspace root and after proper validation of the paths.
            *   **Avoid User-Controlled Paths for Critical Includes:** Re-evaluate if user configuration of `basePathForCode` is strictly necessary for core extension functionality. If possible, find safer alternatives to handle project paths or limit user control over paths to critical bootstrap files.
        *   **Code Integrity Checks (Optional but Recommended):**
            *   **File Content Verification:**  Consider implementing checks to verify the integrity or expected content of `vendor/autoload.php` and `bootstrap/app.php` before including them, although this might be complex and could introduce compatibility issues.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        *   **Victim Installs Extension:** The victim must have the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension installed in VSCode.
        *   **Victim Opens Malicious Repository:** The victim must open a malicious Laravel repository in VSCode.
        *   **Malicious Workspace Settings:** The malicious repository must contain a `.vscode/settings.json` file that overrides the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode` setting to point to a malicious path.
        *   **Malicious Bootstrap Files:** The attacker must place malicious `vendor/autoload.php` or `bootstrap/app.php` files in the directory specified by the malicious `basePathForCode`.
        *   **Extension Activation:** The extension must be activated within the workspace (typically by opening a PHP or Blade file).

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        *   **File:** `src/helpers.ts`
        *   **Function:** `projectPath(file: string, forCode: boolean = false)`
            *   ```typescript
                static projectPath(file: string, forCode: boolean = false) : string {
                    if (forCode) {
                        let basePathForCode = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('basePathForCode');
                        if (basePathForCode) {
                            return path.join(basePathForCode, file); // Path is constructed using user-provided basePathForCode
                        }
                    }
                    return path.join(Helpers.workspacePath(), file);
                }
                ```
            *   **Explanation:**
                *   Retrieves the `basePathForCode` setting from VSCode configuration if `forCode` is true.
                *   If `basePathForCode` is set, it constructs the project path by joining `basePathForCode` with the provided `file` argument (e.g., "vendor/autoload.php", "bootstrap/app.php").
                *   If `basePathForCode` is not set or `forCode` is false, it uses the default workspace path.
                *   **Vulnerability:** When `forCode` is true, the function directly uses the user-controlled `basePathForCode` to construct file paths without validation.

        *   **Function:** `runLaravel()`
            *   ```typescript
                static async runLaravel(command: string) : Promise<string> {
                    return Helpers.runPhp("<?php\n" +
                        "error_reporting(E_ALL);\n" +
                        "ini_set('display_errors', '1');\n" +
                        "set_time_limit(30);\n" +
                        "if (!file_exists('" + Helpers.projectPath("vendor/autoload.php", true) + "')) {\n" + // Path derived from basePathForCode
                        "    echo 'File not found: vendor/autoload.php';" +
                        "    return;" +
                        "}\n" +
                        "require_once '" + Helpers.projectPath("vendor/autoload.php", true) + "';\n" + // Vulnerable require_once

                        "try {\n" +
                        "    $kernel = $app->make(Illuminate\\Contracts\\Console\\Kernel::class);\n" +
                        "    $status = $kernel->handle(\n" +
                        "        \$input = new Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\StringInput('" + command + "')\n" +
                        "    );\n" +
                        "    $kernel->terminate(\$input, $status);\n" +
                        "    echo \\App::VERSION();" +
                        "} catch (\\Exception \$e) {\n" +
                        "    echo 'Laravel error: ' . \$e->getMessage();\n" +

                    "?>", "Laravel " + command);
                }
                ```
            *   **Explanation:**
                *   Constructs PHP code that attempts to bootstrap a Laravel application.
                *   Uses `Helpers.projectPath("vendor/autoload.php", true)` and `Helpers.projectPath("bootstrap/app.php", true)` to generate paths for `vendor/autoload.php` and `bootstrap/app.php`, respectively, with `forCode` set to `true`, making them dependent on `basePathForCode`.
                *   **Vulnerability:** The `require_once` statements on lines 28 and 29 directly include files using paths derived from the user-controlled `basePathForCode`. If `basePathForCode` is manipulated to point to a malicious directory containing crafted `vendor/autoload.php` or `bootstrap/app.php` files, arbitrary PHP code will be executed during these `require_once` calls.

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  **Setup:**
            *   Create a new directory named `laravel-vuln-test-basepath`.
            *   Open the `laravel-vuln-test-basepath` folder in VSCode.
            *   Install the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension in VSCode.
        2.  **Malicious Configuration and Files:**
            *   Inside `laravel-vuln-test-basepath`, create a directory named `malicious_path`.
            *   Inside `malicious_path`, create a file named `vendor` and then inside `vendor` create `autoload.php` with the following malicious PHP code:
                ```php
                <?php
                touch('/tmp/vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-basepath-pwned');
                ```
                (For Windows, use `file_put_contents('%TEMP%\\vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-basepath-pwned.txt', 'pwned');` instead of `touch`).
            *   Create a `.vscode` directory in `laravel-vuln-test-basepath`.
            *   Inside `.vscode`, create a `settings.json` file with the following configuration to set the malicious `basePathForCode`:
                ```json
                {
                    "LaravelExtraIntellisense.basePathForCode": "./malicious_path"
                }
                ```
        3.  **Trigger Extension Activation:**
            *   Open any PHP file or Blade file in the `laravel-vuln-test-basepath` workspace. This will activate the extension.
        4.  **Verify Code Injection:**
            *   **Linux/macOS:** Check if the file `/tmp/vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-basepath-pwned` has been created using the terminal command `ls /tmp/vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-basepath-pwned`.
            *   **Windows:** Check if the file `%TEMP%\vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-basepath-pwned.txt` has been created.
        5.  **Expected Result:**
            *   The file `/tmp/vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-basepath-pwned` (or `%TEMP%\vscode-laravel-extra-intellisense-basepath-pwned.txt` on Windows) should be created. This indicates that the malicious code in `malicious_path/vendor/autoload.php` was executed due to the manipulated `basePathForCode` setting, confirming the code injection vulnerability.
