### Combined Vulnerability Report

This report combines identified vulnerabilities from provided lists into a single, de-duplicated list, detailing each vulnerability's specifics.

#### 1. Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `deno.path` setting

* Description:
    1. The VSCode Deno extension allows users to specify the path to the Deno executable using the `deno.path` setting. This setting can be configured at the user level, workspace level, or workspace folder level.
    2. The extension uses `child_process.spawn` (indirectly via `vscode-languageclient`) to execute the Deno CLI with arguments provided by the extension.
    3. If a malicious user can influence the `deno.path` setting to point to a malicious executable, or an executable path containing command injection, they can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) when the extension attempts to start the Deno Language Server or execute Deno commands.
    4. An attacker can achieve this by crafting a malicious repository that includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file with a manipulated `deno.path` setting.  Within this `settings.json`, the threat actor sets the `deno.path` configuration to a malicious executable path. For example: `"deno.path": "/path/to/malicious.sh"` or on Windows `"deno.path": "C:\\path\\to\\malicious.bat"`. This malicious "deno" executable could be a script or binary designed to execute arbitrary commands.
    5. When a victim opens this malicious repository in VSCode and the Deno extension is activated, the extension will attempt to use the malicious path, leading to command injection.
    6. For example, a malicious repository could include `.vscode/settings.json` with the following content:
        ```json
        {
            "deno.path": "node_modules/.bin/malicious-script"
        }
        ```
        or
        ```json
        {
            "deno.path": "/path/to/deno; touch /tmp/pwned"
        }
        ```
    7. When the extension starts the language server, it will execute the command specified in `deno.path`, potentially running arbitrary code on the victim's machine. Instead of executing the legitimate Deno CLI, the extension executes the malicious script or binary provided by the attacker.
    8. The malicious executable then executes arbitrary commands on the victim's machine under the context of the VSCode process.

* Impact:
    * Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This could lead to complete compromise of the victim's system, data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

* Vulnerability Rank: critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None. The extension directly uses the path provided in the settings to execute the Deno CLI. The extension relies on the user-provided path without proper validation.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * Input validation and sanitization for the `deno.path` setting. The extension should validate that the provided path is a valid path to an executable and does not contain any malicious commands or shell injection sequences. The extension should verify that the provided path points to a valid Deno executable and does not contain malicious commands or path traversal sequences.
    * Restricting the `deno.path` setting to be configurable only at the user level, or providing a warning if it is configured at the workspace level. This would reduce the risk of malicious repositories automatically triggering the vulnerability.
    * Using `child_process.spawn` with `shell: false` to avoid shell interpretation of the command path.
    * Consider restricting the allowed characters in the `deno.path` setting to only alphanumeric characters, path separators, and specific allowed symbols.
    * Implement checks to ensure the executable is actually a Deno binary and not a script or other malicious file.

* Preconditions:
    * The victim must have the VSCode Deno extension installed and enabled.
    * The victim must open a malicious repository in VSCode that contains a `.vscode/settings.json` file with a manipulated `deno.path` setting. Or the user has globally set a malicious `deno.path` in their VSCode settings.
    * The Deno extension must be activated in the opened workspace.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `client\src\util.ts`**:
        ```typescript
        export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
          const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
          // ...
          return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
        }

        function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
          const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)
            .get<string>("path");
          return exePath;
        }
        ```
        This code retrieves the `deno.path` setting directly from VSCode configuration using `workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string>("path")` without any validation. The `getDenoCommandPath` function then returns this user-provided path without any validation or sanitization. It is also possible for the path to be blank, in which case it returns undefined.

    2. **File: `client\src\commands.ts`**:
        ```typescript
        export function startLanguageServer(
          context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
          extensionContext: DenoExtensionContext,
        ): Callback {
          return async () => {
            // ...
            const command = await getDenoCommandPath(); // Path is retrieved here
            if (command == null) {
              // ...
              return;
            }

            const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
              run: {
                command, // Malicious command from settings is used here
                args: ["lsp"],
                options: { env },
              },
              debug: {
                command, // Malicious command from settings is used here
                args: ["lsp"],
                options: { env },
              },
            };
            const client = new LanguageClient(
              LANGUAGE_CLIENT_ID,
              LANGUAGE_CLIENT_NAME,
              serverOptions,
              {
                // ...
              },
            );
            await client.start();
            // ...
          };
        }
        ```
        The `startLanguageServer` function uses the `command` obtained from `getDenoCommandPath()` directly in `ServerOptions.run.command` and `ServerOptions.debug.command` for the LanguageClient. The `LanguageClient` uses `child_process.spawn` internally to execute this command.  Because `child_process.spawn` is used without `shell: false` and without sanitizing the `command`, it can be vulnerable to command injection if the `command` is user-controlled and not properly validated. The `command` variable, which is the user-controlled `deno.path`, is directly used as the executable command in `child_process.spawn` (implicitly used by `LanguageClient`). This allows for command injection if the user provides a malicious path.

    *Visualization:*

    ```
    User Setting "deno.path" --> getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() --> getDenoCommandPath() --> startLanguageServer() --> LanguageClient (child_process.spawn) --> Command Execution
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new directory named `malicious-repo`.
    2. Inside `malicious-repo`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
        ```json
        {
            "deno.path": "/bin/bash -c 'touch /tmp/vscode-deno-pwned'"
        }
        ```
        *(Note: For Windows, use `deno.path": "cmd.exe /c type nul >> %TEMP%\\vscode-deno-pwned.txt"` or similar)*
        Alternatively, on Linux/macOS create a file named `malicious.sh` with the following content and make it executable using `chmod +x malicious.sh`:
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Vulnerable to Command Injection!" > output.txt
        echo "Malicious script executed with arguments: $*" >> output.txt
        whoami >> output.txt
        ```
        And in `.vscode/settings.json`:
        ```json
        {
          "deno.path": "./malicious.sh"
        }
        ```
        On Windows, create a file named `malicious.bat` with the following content:
        ```bat
        @echo off
        echo Vulnerable to Command Injection! > output.txt
        echo Malicious script executed with arguments: %* >> output.txt
        whoami >> output.txt
        ```
        And in `.vscode/settings.json`:
        ```json
        {
          "deno.path": ".\\malicious.bat"
        }
        ```
    4. Open VSCode and open the `malicious-repo` directory as a workspace.
    5. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace (if prompted, enable it, or ensure `"deno.enable": true` is set in workspace settings).
    6. Observe if a file named `vscode-deno-pwned` is created in the `/tmp/` directory (or `%TEMP%` on Windows) after VSCode initializes the Deno extension and attempts to start the language server. Or check the `vscode_deno_test_repo` directory for a file named `output.txt`.
    7. If the file is created, it confirms that the command injection vulnerability is present, and arbitrary commands can be executed via the `deno.path` setting. If the vulnerability is present, `output.txt` will be created and contain the output from the malicious script, including "Vulnerable to Command Injection!", the arguments passed to the script, and the output of the `whoami` command. This confirms that the malicious script specified in `deno.path` was executed by the extension.


#### 2. Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Test Arguments Settings (`deno.codeLens.testArgs`, `deno.testing.args`)

* Description:
    1. A threat actor crafts a malicious repository containing a `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    2. Within this `settings.json`, the threat actor sets the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` or `deno.testing.args` configuration to include malicious command arguments. For example: `"deno.codeLens.testArgs": ["--allow-read", "--allow-write", "--", "; touch injected.txt"]`.
    3. The victim opens this malicious repository in VSCode with the Deno extension installed and enabled.
    4. The victim executes a Deno test, either via code lens "Run Test" action or through the VSCode testing explorer.
    5. The Deno extension constructs the `deno test` command, incorporating the attacker-controlled arguments from `deno.codeLens.testArgs` or `deno.testing.args` settings without sufficient sanitization.
    6. When the `deno test` command is executed, the injected malicious arguments are passed to the Deno CLI, leading to command injection. In the example above, `; touch injected.txt` will be appended and executed as a separate command after the `deno test` command.

* Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can inject arbitrary commands that are executed when Deno tests are run, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or system compromise.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The extension directly passes the arguments to the Deno CLI without validation.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * Input validation and sanitization for the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args` settings. The extension should validate that the arguments are safe and do not contain command injection sequences.
    * Consider using a safer method to pass arguments to the Deno CLI, such as programmatically constructing the arguments instead of directly concatenating strings.
    * Warn users about the security risks of modifying these settings, especially when opening untrusted workspaces.

* Preconditions:
    * The victim has the VSCode Deno extension installed and enabled.
    * The victim opens a malicious repository containing a crafted `.vscode/settings.json` or the user has globally set malicious test arguments in their VSCode settings.
    * The victim executes Deno tests using the code lens or test explorer feature.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `client/src/commands.ts`
    2. Function: `test()`
    3. This function retrieves `deno.codeLens.testArgs` from VSCode configuration:
    ```typescript
    const config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS, uri);
    const testArgs: string[] = [
      ...(config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs") ?? []),
    ];
    ```
    4. These `testArgs` are directly incorporated into the command line arguments for `deno test`:
    ```typescript
    const args = ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", nameRegex, filePath];
    const definition: tasks.DenoTaskDefinition = {
      type: tasks.TASK_TYPE,
      command: "test",
      args, // testArgs are included here
      env,
    };
    // ... task execution ...
    ```
    5. The `args` array, including user-controlled `testArgs`, is passed to `ProcessExecution` which will execute the command. No sanitization or validation is performed on `testArgs` before execution.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new directory named `vscode_deno_test_repo_testargs`.
    2. Inside `vscode_deno_test_repo_testargs`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
        ```json
        {
          "deno.codeLens.testArgs": ["; touch injected_testargs.txt"]
        }
        ```
    4. Inside `vscode_deno_test_repo_testargs`, create a file named `test.ts` with a simple Deno test:
        ```typescript
        import { assertEquals } from "https://deno.land/std/assert/mod.ts";

        Deno.test("simple test", () => {
          assertEquals(1, 1);
        });
        ```
    5. Open the `vscode_deno_test_repo_testargs` directory in VSCode.
    6. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled.
    7. Open the `test.ts` file. You should see the "▶ Run Test" code lens above the `Deno.test` declaration.
    8. Click on the "▶ Run Test" code lens to execute the test.
    9. After the test execution completes, check the `vscode_deno_test_repo_testargs` directory for a file named `injected_testargs.txt`.
    10. If the vulnerability is present, `injected_testargs.txt` will be created, indicating that the command injection in `deno.codeLens.testArgs` was successful and arbitrary commands were executed during test execution.


#### 3. Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Tasks Definitions (`tasks.json`, `deno.json(c)`)

* Description:
    1. A threat actor crafts a malicious repository containing a `.vscode/tasks.json` or `deno.json(c)` file.
    2. Within these configuration files, the threat actor defines a task with malicious commands in the `command` and/or `args` properties of a `DenoTaskDefinition`. For example, in `tasks.json`:
        ```json
        {
          "version": "2.0.0",
          "tasks": [
            {
              "type": "deno",
              "command": "run",
              "args": ["`; touch injected_task.txt`"]
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
    3. The victim opens this malicious repository in VSCode with the Deno extension installed and enabled.
    4. The Deno extension parses the `tasks.json` or `deno.json(c)` file and registers the defined tasks in the VSCode task system.
    5. The victim manually executes the malicious task from the VSCode Tasks: Run Task... menu or the Deno Tasks sidebar.
    6. The Deno extension executes the defined task, directly using the attacker-provided `command` and `args` without proper sanitization.
    7. The injected commands within `command` or `args` are executed by the shell during task execution, leading to command injection. In the example above, `; touch injected_task.txt` will be executed as a separate command.

* Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can define malicious tasks that execute arbitrary commands when run by the victim, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or system compromise.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The extension relies on task definitions from workspace files without validation or sandboxing.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * Input validation and sanitization for task definitions in `tasks.json` and `deno.json(c)`. The extension should validate `command` and `args` properties to prevent command injection.
    * Consider providing a warning to users when tasks from workspace files are detected, especially in untrusted workspaces, highlighting the potential security risks of executing arbitrary tasks.
    * Explore sandboxing or safer execution mechanisms for tasks to limit the impact of command injection vulnerabilities.

* Preconditions:
    * The victim has the VSCode Deno extension installed and enabled.
    * The victim opens a malicious repository containing a crafted `.vscode/tasks.json` or `deno.json(c)` file with malicious task definitions.
    * The victim manually executes the malicious task from the VSCode task menu or sidebar.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `client/src/tasks.ts` and `client/src/tasks_sidebar.ts`
    2. Functions: `buildDenoTask()` in `tasks.ts`,  `DenoTaskProvider.provideTasks()` and `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider` in `tasks_sidebar.ts`.
    3. The `DenoTaskProvider` reads task definitions and creates `vscode.Task` objects using `buildDenoTask()`.
    4. `buildDenoTask()` directly uses the `command` and `args` from `DenoTaskDefinition` to create a `ProcessExecution`:
    ```typescript
    export function buildDenoTask(
      // ...
      definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
      // ...
    ): vscode.Task {
      const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
        process, // deno command path
        args,    // user-provided args from task definition
        definition,
      );

      return new vscode.Task( ... , exec, ... );
    }
    ```
    5. The `ProcessExecution` will execute the `process` with the provided `args`. If a malicious `tasks.json` or `deno.json(c)` is provided, the `args` will contain attacker-controlled commands, leading to command injection.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new directory named `vscode_deno_test_repo_tasks`.
    2. Inside `vscode_deno_test_repo_tasks`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `tasks.json` with the following content:
        ```json
        {
          "version": "2.0.0",
          "tasks": [
            {
              "type": "deno",
              "command": "run",
              "args": ["; touch injected_task.txt"],
              "label": "Malicious Task"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
    4. Open the `vscode_deno_test_repo_tasks` directory in VSCode.
    5. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled.
    6. Open the VSCode command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and type "Tasks: Run Task". Select "Tasks: Run Task".
    7. From the task list, select "deno: Malicious Task".
    8. After the task execution completes, check the `vscode_deno_test_repo_tasks` directory for a file named `injected_task.txt`.
    9. If the vulnerability is present, `injected_task.txt` will be created, indicating that the command injection in the task definition was successful and arbitrary commands were executed when the task was run.
