#### Vulnerability: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious `deno.path` Configuration

- **Description:**
    - An attacker can trick a user into configuring the `deno.path` setting in the VS Code Deno extension.
    - This setting is intended to allow users to specify the path to their Deno CLI executable.
    - However, the extension directly uses this path to execute Deno CLI commands without proper validation.
    - An attacker can leverage this by convincing a user to set `deno.path` to point to a malicious executable instead of the legitimate Deno CLI.
    - Once `deno.path` is maliciously configured, any action by the VS Code Deno extension that involves running a Deno command (e.g., starting the Language Server, caching dependencies, running tests, formatting code) will result in the execution of the malicious executable. This can also be achieved by delivering a malicious project with `.vscode/settings.json` that overrides the `deno.path` setting.

- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
    - The malicious code will be executed with the same privileges as the VS Code process, which is typically user-level privileges.
    - This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
        - Data theft and exfiltration.
        - Installation of malware or ransomware.
        - System compromise and unauthorized access.

- **Vulnerability rank:** Critical

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None. The extension's code does not include any input validation or sanitization of the `deno.path` setting.
    - The `README.md` provides a note about the `deno.path` setting and the necessity of having Deno CLI installed, but this is not a technical mitigation and relies on user awareness.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `deno.path` setting. The extension should verify that the provided path points to a legitimate Deno executable and potentially reside in a trusted location.  This could include checking the executable's name, signature, or location.
    - Implement a warning message to be displayed when the user modifies the `deno.path` setting, especially if it points to a location within the workspace or a temporary directory, emphasizing the security risks associated with pointing it to untrusted executables.
    - Enhance documentation and potentially the extension settings UI to clearly warn users about the security implications of modifying the `deno.path` setting and advise them to only point it to trusted Deno CLI executables.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the VS Code Deno extension installed and activated.
    - The user must be tricked into changing the `deno.path` setting in VS Code to point to a malicious executable. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing attacks, by opening a malicious repository containing a crafted `.vscode/settings.json`, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in VS Code settings synchronization mechanisms.

- **Source code analysis:**
    - `client\src\util.ts`: The `getDenoCommandPath()` function is responsible for determining the path to the Deno executable.
        - It first checks the workspace configuration for the `deno.path` setting using `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`.
        - If `deno.path` is set, it uses this value directly. There is no validation or sanitization of this path.
        - If `deno.path` is a relative path, it attempts to resolve it relative to the workspace folders.
        - If `deno.path` is not set or resolution fails, it falls back to `getDefaultDenoCommand()`, which searches for "deno" in the system's PATH environment variable and default installation directories.
    - `client\src\commands.ts`: The `startLanguageServer()` function utilizes `getDenoCommandPath()` to obtain the Deno executable path.
        - The returned path is directly used to spawn the Deno Language Server process using `child_process.spawn` (indirectly via `vscode-languageclient`).
        - No checks are performed to validate the legitimacy or safety of the obtained executable path before execution.
    - `client\src\extension.ts`: Configuration changes to `deno.path` trigger a restart of the Deno Language Server via the `deno.client.restart` command, which in turn calls `startLanguageServer()`, leading to the execution of the executable specified in the potentially malicious `deno.path` setting.
    - `client\src\tasks.ts`: The `buildDenoTask()` function also uses `getDenoCommandPath()` (indirectly via `getDenoCommandName()`) and then uses this potentially malicious path in `ProcessExecution`.

        graph LR
            subgraph VS Code Deno Extension
                A[User Settings (deno.path) / .vscode/settings.json] --> B(VS Code Configuration);
                B --> C{Extension uses Deno CLI};
                C --> D[getDenoCommandPath() in util.ts];
                D --> E[Returns malicious path];
                E --> F[startLanguageServer() in commands.ts OR buildDenoTask() in tasks.ts];
                F --> G[Process Execution with malicious path];
                G --> H[Malicious Code Execution on User Machine];
            end
        ```

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Prepare Malicious Executable:**
        - Create a malicious script file (e.g., `malicious-deno.sh` for Linux/macOS or `malicious-deno.bat` for Windows) that performs an easily verifiable action, such as creating a file and writing content or capturing user information.
        - Ensure the script is executable (`chmod +x malicious-deno.sh`).
    2. **VS Code Configuration (Option 1: User Settings):**
        - Open VS Code and navigate to Settings (Ctrl+, or Cmd+,).
        - Search for "deno.path" and locate the "Deno › Path" setting.
        - Set the "Deno › Path" setting to the absolute path of the malicious script.
    3. **VS Code Configuration (Option 2: Workspace Settings):**
        - Create a new directory `malicious-workspace`.
        - Inside `malicious-workspace`, create `.vscode` directory.
        - Inside `.vscode`, create `settings.json` with content:
          ```json
          {
              "deno.path": "/path/to/malicious-deno.sh" // or "C:\\path\\to\\malicious-deno.bat"
          }
          ```
        - Open `malicious-workspace` in VS Code.
    4. **Trigger Extension Functionality:**
        - Open a TypeScript or JavaScript file in VS Code to activate the Deno extension's Language Server, or execute a Deno command from the command palette (e.g., "Deno: Cache", "Deno: Format Document").
    5. **Verification:**
        - Check for the indicator of malicious execution (e.g., the creation of a file with specific content, or other actions performed by the malicious script).
        - For example, if the malicious script creates `/tmp/malicious_execution.txt` with content "Malicious Deno Executable Executed!", check if this file exists and has the correct content.

This single vulnerability report combines the information from all provided lists, as they describe the same core issue of arbitrary code execution via malicious `deno.path` configuration.
