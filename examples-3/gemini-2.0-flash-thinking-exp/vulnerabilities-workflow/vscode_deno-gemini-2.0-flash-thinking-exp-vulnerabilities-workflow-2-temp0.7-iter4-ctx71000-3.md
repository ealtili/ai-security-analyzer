- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Deno Executable Path Configuration

- Description:
    1. An attacker uses social engineering or other techniques to trick a user into manually modifying the `deno.path` setting within the VS Code Deno extension's configuration.
    2. The attacker provides the user with a path that points to a malicious executable file, instead of the legitimate Deno CLI executable. This malicious executable can be located anywhere on the user's file system or even a network share accessible to the user.
    3. The user, believing they are setting the path to the Deno CLI, configures the `deno.path` setting with the malicious path.
    4. Subsequently, when the VS Code Deno extension needs to execute Deno CLI commands for various features like language server functionalities (type checking, linting, formatting, testing, caching, etc.), it retrieves the configured `deno.path`.
    5. Instead of invoking the genuine Deno CLI, the extension unknowingly executes the malicious executable specified in `deno.path`.
    6. The malicious executable now runs with the privileges of the user who is running VS Code, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.

- Impact:
    Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the user's system, steal sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The code does not implement any explicit mitigations against this vulnerability. The extension reads the `deno.path` setting directly from VS Code configuration and uses it to execute Deno commands without validation.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation for the `deno.path` setting: The extension should validate the provided path to ensure it is likely to be a legitimate Deno executable. This could include checks such as:
        - Verifying that the file exists at the specified path.
        - Checking the file extension to ensure it is an executable format for the operating system (e.g., `.exe` on Windows, executable permissions on Linux/macOS).
        - Potentially checking the file's digital signature or hash against known Deno CLI signatures (though this might be complex to maintain).
        - Validating the path against a list of allowed or disallowed directories to prevent execution from obviously suspicious locations (e.g., temporary directories).
    - User warnings: When the `deno.path` setting is changed by the user, especially if it deviates from the default behavior of using the environment path, the extension should display a prominent warning message. This warning should highlight the security risks associated with using custom executable paths and advise users to only set this path if they are absolutely sure it points to a trusted Deno CLI executable.
    - Recommendation against using `deno.path`: The extension's documentation and UI could be updated to strongly recommend relying on the Deno CLI being available in the system's PATH environment variable. Setting `deno.path` should be presented as an advanced option for specific use cases and discouraged for general users to minimize the risk of misconfiguration.

- Preconditions:
    1. The VS Code Deno extension must be installed and enabled.
    2. The attacker must be able to convince a user to change the `deno.path` setting in VS Code to a malicious executable. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to modify the user's VS Code settings.
    3. The user must have write access to a location on their file system where the attacker can place the malicious executable, or the attacker must provide a path to a malicious executable hosted on a network share accessible to the user.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`client\src\util.ts` - `getDenoCommandPath()` function:**
        ```typescript
        export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
          const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
          const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
          if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
            return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
          } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
            // if sent a relative path, iterate over workspace folders to try and resolve.
            for (const workspace of workspaceFolders) {
              const commandPath = path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command);
              if (await fileExists(commandPath)) {
                return commandPath;
              }
            }
            return undefined;
          } else {
            return command;
          }
        }
        ```
        This function is responsible for determining the path to the Deno executable. It first calls `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` to retrieve the `deno.path` setting from VS Code configuration. If `deno.path` is set, the function prioritizes this configured path. If the configured path is relative, it attempts to resolve it within workspace folders. If `deno.path` is not set or is not resolvable, it falls back to `getDefaultDenoCommand()` to search for "deno" in the system's PATH.
        Crucially, there is **no validation** of the `command` variable obtained from `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`. The function directly returns this path (after potential relative path resolution) without any checks to ensure it points to a valid or safe executable.

    2. **`client\src\util.ts` - `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` function:**
        ```typescript
        function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
          const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)
            .get<string>("path");
          // it is possible for the path to be blank. In that case, return undefined
          if (typeof exePath === "string" && exePath.trim().length === 0) {
            return undefined;
          } else {
            return exePath;
          }
        }
        ```
        This function simply retrieves the `deno.path` configuration setting using `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string>("path")`. It performs a basic check for an empty string but **does not perform any validation** on the content of the `exePath` string itself.

    3. **`client\src\commands.ts` - `startLanguageServer()` function:**
        ```typescript
        const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
          run: {
            command, // command from getDenoCommandPath()
            args: ["lsp"],
            options: { env },
          },
          debug: {
            command, // command from getDenoCommandPath()
            // disabled for now, as this gets super chatty during development
            // args: ["lsp", "-L", "debug"],
            args: ["lsp"],
            options: { env },
          },
        };
        const client = new LanguageClient( ... , serverOptions, ... );
        await client.start();
        ```
        In the `startLanguageServer()` function, the `command` variable, which is the potentially malicious path obtained from `getDenoCommandPath()`, is directly used within the `serverOptions` to define how the Language Server process is launched. The `LanguageClient` then uses these `serverOptions` to execute the specified command. Because there is no validation before this point, a malicious executable path configured in `deno.path` will be executed.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    User Configuration (settings.json) -->  VS Code API (getConfiguration) --> getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() --> getDenoCommandPath() --> startLanguageServer() --> LanguageClient (execute command) --> Malicious Executable Runs
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a Malicious Executable:**
        - Create a script file named `malicious-deno` (or `malicious-deno.bat` on Windows) in a directory of your choice (e.g., `/tmp` or `C:\temp`).
        - **Linux/macOS (`malicious-deno`):**
            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "[MALICIOUS DENO EXECUTABLE]: Executed with user ID: $(id -u)"
            # Simulate malicious activity (e.g., create a file)
            echo "Malicious action!" > /tmp/malicious_activity.txt
            exit 1 # Exit with an error code to prevent further extension actions
            ```
            Make it executable: `chmod +x /tmp/malicious-deno`
        - **Windows (`malicious-deno.bat`):**
            ```batch
            @echo off
            echo [MALICIOUS DENO EXECUTABLE]: Executed by user: %USERNAME%
            REM Simulate malicious activity (e.g., create a file)
            echo Malicious action! > C:\temp\malicious_activity.txt
            exit 1  // Exit with an error code
            ```
    2. **Configure `deno.path` in VS Code:**
        - Open VS Code.
        - Go to VS Code Settings (`File` -> `Preferences` -> `Settings` or `Code` -> `Settings` -> `Settings`).
        - Search for "deno.path".
        - In the "Deno â€º Path" setting, enter the absolute path to your malicious executable file (e.g., `/tmp/malicious-deno` or `C:\temp\malicious-deno.bat`).

    3. **Enable Deno for a Workspace:**
        - Open or create a new VS Code workspace (folder).
        - Ensure Deno is enabled for this workspace. If not already enabled, you can run the command "Deno: Enable" from the VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).

    4. **Trigger Deno Extension Functionality:**
        - Open any JavaScript or TypeScript file in your workspace.
        - Trigger a Deno extension feature that invokes the Deno CLI. Examples include:
            - **Formatting:** Right-click in the editor and select "Format Document With..." -> "Deno".
            - **Linting:**  The extension may automatically try to lint the file. You can also try to manually trigger linting if available.
            - **Caching:** Run the command "Deno: Cache" from the Command Palette.
            - **Testing:** If you have Deno test code, attempt to run tests using code lens or the testing explorer.

    5. **Observe Malicious Executable Execution:**
        - After triggering a Deno feature, check for the following:
            - **Output in VS Code Output Panel:** You should see the output from your malicious executable in the "Deno Language Server" output panel (View -> Output, select "Deno Language Server" in the dropdown). Look for the "[MALICIOUS DENO EXECUTABLE]" message.
            - **Malicious Activity:** Verify if the simulated malicious action was performed. For example, check if the `/tmp/malicious_activity.txt` (or `C:\temp\malicious_activity.txt` on Windows) file was created.
        - If you see the output from your malicious executable and the malicious activity is performed, the vulnerability is confirmed. The VS Code Deno extension has executed your malicious executable instead of the real Deno CLI due to the insecure `deno.path` configuration.
