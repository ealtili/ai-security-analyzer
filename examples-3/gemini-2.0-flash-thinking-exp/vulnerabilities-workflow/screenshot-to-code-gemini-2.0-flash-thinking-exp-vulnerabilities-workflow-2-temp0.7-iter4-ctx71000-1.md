### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via AI-Generated Code
- Description:
    1. A malicious user crafts a screenshot or screen recording that includes malicious JavaScript code disguised as legitimate UI elements or text.
    2. The user uploads this malicious screenshot or screen recording to the application.
    3. The backend AI model processes the image/video and generates code based on the visual input, unknowingly incorporating the malicious JavaScript code into the generated HTML, CSS, or JavaScript output.
    4. The backend sends this AI-generated code, which now contains the embedded malicious script, to the frontend.
    5. The frontend, without proper sanitization, renders this AI-generated code in the user's browser.
    6. As the browser parses and executes the HTML, the injected malicious JavaScript code gets executed, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Impact:
    * **Account Takeover:** An attacker could steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to account hijacking.
    * **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to extract data from the user's browser and send it to a remote server controlled by the attacker.
    * **Website Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of the web page displayed to the user, redirecting them to malicious sites or displaying misleading information.
    * **Malware Distribution:** XSS can be used to serve malware to the user's browser.
    * **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can use XSS to overlay fake login forms on the legitimate application to steal user credentials.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None identified in the provided project files. The code generation logic and rendering pipeline do not appear to include any explicit sanitization steps for the AI-generated code.
- Missing Mitigations:
    * **Backend Sanitization:** The backend should sanitize the AI-generated code before sending it to the frontend. This could involve parsing the generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and removing or escaping any potentially malicious code, especially JavaScript event handlers or script tags. Libraries like DOMPurify (for HTML) or similar tools for CSS and JavaScript could be used on the backend.
    * **Frontend Sanitization:** The frontend should also implement sanitization before rendering the AI-generated code. Even if backend sanitization is in place, defense-in-depth principles recommend frontend sanitization as well. Using React's built-in mechanisms for safe HTML rendering or libraries like DOMPurify on the frontend can help prevent XSS. Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a strict CSP header can limit the capabilities of injected scripts, reducing the potential impact of XSS vulnerabilities. CSP can restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and prevent inline JavaScript execution.
- Preconditions:
    * The attacker needs to be able to craft a screenshot or screen recording that can be processed by the AI model in a way that malicious JavaScript is embedded in the generated code.
    * The application must be configured to process user-uploaded screenshots or screen recordings using AI models and render the output in the frontend.
    * The frontend must render the AI-generated code without proper sanitization.
- Source Code Analysis:
    * **`backend/llm.py`**: This file handles the communication with the LLMs (like OpenAI, Claude). The `stream_openai_response`, `stream_claude_response`, and `stream_gemini_response` functions receive prompts and return code generated by the LLMs as strings. There is no code in these functions or in `codegen/utils.py` that sanitizes the generated code before returning it.
    * **`backend/main.py`**: This is the FastAPI application. The routes (defined in `routes` directory) handle receiving user input (screenshots/videos), calling the LLM functions in `llm.py` to generate code, and then sending this generated code to the frontend.
    * **`backend/routes/generate_code.py`**: This file contains the `/generate-code` websocket endpoint which is responsible for handling code generation requests.
        * It uses functions from `llm.py` to get code from LLMs (`stream_openai_response`, `stream_claude_response`, `stream_gemini_response`).
        * The generated code is processed by `extract_html_content` function. While the name suggests HTML processing, there's no indication of sanitization within this function or elsewhere in `generate_code.py`. It's likely that `extract_html_content` only extracts the HTML part from the LLM response without sanitizing it.
        * The code is then sent to the frontend via WebSocket using `send_message` with "chunk" and "setCode" types, without any sanitization.
    * **`frontend` (code not provided in files):** Based on typical React/Vite frontend structures and the project description, it's highly probable that the frontend receives the code string from the backend and renders it to the user. If the frontend uses methods like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (or similar approaches for other frameworks) to render the HTML code directly without sanitization, it will be vulnerable to XSS.

    **Visualization of Vulnerability Flow:**

    ```
    [Attacker crafts malicious screenshot/video] --> [Upload to Frontend] --> [Backend API Endpoint (/generate-code)] --> [LLM in backend/llm.py (Code Generation)] --> [Unsanitized Code string] --> [backend/routes/generate_code.py] --> [extract_html_content (likely no sanitization)] --> [Unsanitized Code string via WebSocket] --> [Frontend (React/Vite)] --> [dangerouslySetInnerHTML or similar insecure rendering] --> [XSS Execution in User Browser]
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Deploy a publicly accessible instance of the `screenshot-to-code` application.
    2. **Craft Malicious Screenshot:** Create a screenshot that visually resembles a normal UI element (e.g., a button or text box), but includes hidden malicious JavaScript code. For example, embed JavaScript within an HTML attribute like `onload` or `onerror` within an `<img>` tag, or within a `<script>` tag disguised as text content. A simple example could be a screenshot containing: `<img src="invalid-url" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability')" alt="Benign UI Element">`.
    3. **Upload Screenshot:** Using the application's frontend, upload the crafted malicious screenshot. Select any supported stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind).
    4. **Observe Output:** After the AI processes the screenshot and generates code, examine the rendered output in the browser.
    5. **Verify XSS:** If the XSS vulnerability is present, an alert box (as in the example payload) will pop up in the browser, or other JavaScript code will execute (depending on the injected payload). Inspect the page source to confirm that the malicious JavaScript code from the screenshot is present in the rendered HTML.

    **Example Malicious Screenshot Content (to be visually embedded in a screenshot):**
    ```html
    <div id="vulnerableElement">
        <p>Click me (harmless UI element)</p>
        <img src="invalid-url" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected!')" style="display:none;">
    </div>
    ```
    When the AI processes the screenshot, it might generate code that includes the `onerror` attribute. If rendered unsanitized, clicking or interacting with the generated element (or even just page load depending on the payload) will trigger the JavaScript alert, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.

    **Expected Result:** Upon rendering the AI-generated code in the frontend, the injected JavaScript code (`alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected!')`) should execute in the user's browser, proving the XSS vulnerability. If you inspect the HTML source code in the browser, you should find the injected `onerror` attribute or similar malicious script present in the rendered output.
