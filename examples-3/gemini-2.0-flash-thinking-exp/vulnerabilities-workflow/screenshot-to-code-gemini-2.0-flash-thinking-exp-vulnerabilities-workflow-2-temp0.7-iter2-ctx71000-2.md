### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code

- Description:
    - An attacker crafts a screenshot containing malicious JavaScript code embedded within UI elements (e.g., text input fields, image alt text, or even seemingly benign text content).
    - The user uploads this screenshot to the application.
    - The backend processes the screenshot using an AI model to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
    - The AI model, without proper sanitization mechanisms, includes the malicious JavaScript code from the screenshot directly into the generated code.
    - A user, unaware of the malicious code, copies and integrates the AI-generated code into their website or application.
    - When a victim visits the user's website/application and executes the incorporated code, the malicious JavaScript from the attacker's screenshot is executed in the victim's browser, leading to XSS.

- Impact:
    - Execution of malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser.
    - Cookie theft and session hijacking.
    - Redirection to malicious websites.
    - Defacement of the user's website.
    - Data exfiltration.
    - Potential for further attacks on the victim's system.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None observed in the provided project files. The code focuses on functionality (screenshot to code conversion) and evaluation, without explicit security considerations for sanitizing AI-generated output.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Output Sanitization:** Implement robust sanitization of the code generated by the AI models on the backend before presenting it to the user. This should include:
        - HTML sanitization to remove or neutralize potentially malicious HTML tags and attributes (e.g., `<script>`, `onload`, `onerror`, `iframe`, `form`).
        - JavaScript sanitization to parse and analyze JavaScript code, removing or escaping potentially dangerous constructs.
        - CSS sanitization to prevent CSS injection attacks.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers in the web application to restrict the sources from which resources (like JavaScript) can be loaded, and to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks by limiting what malicious scripts can do.
    - **User Education:**  Warn users about the potential risks of directly using AI-generated code without review and sanitization. Provide guidelines on how to review and sanitize the code before deployment.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to create a screenshot with embedded malicious JavaScript. This could be achieved by crafting a UI design or manipulating an existing webpage to include the malicious script visually within the screenshot.
    - A user must upload this crafted screenshot to the screenshot-to-code application and then use the generated code without proper review.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: `backend\llm.py`**: This file handles the interaction with LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini). It sends prompts including the screenshot (as base64 encoded image data URL) to the chosen LLM and streams back the generated code.
        - Code snippet from `llm.py`:
        ```python
        async def stream_openai_response(
            messages: List[ChatCompletionMessageParam],
            api_key: str,
            base_url: str | None,
            callback: Callable[[str], Awaitable[None]],
            model: Llm,
        ) -> Completion:
            # ... interaction with OpenAI API and streaming response ...
        ```
        ```python
        async def stream_claude_response(
            messages: List[ChatCompletionMessageParam],
            api_key: str,
            callback: Callable[[str], Awaitable[None]],
            model: Llm,
        ) -> Completion:
            # ... interaction with Anthropic Claude API and streaming response ...
        ```
        ```python
        async def stream_gemini_response(
            messages: List[ChatCompletionMessageParam],
            api_key: str,
            callback: Callable[[str], Awaitable[None]],
            model: Llm,
        ) -> Completion:
            # ... interaction with Gemini API and streaming response ...
        ```
        - **Analysis:** The code focuses on calling the LLM APIs and streaming the response. There is no code in this file responsible for sanitizing the output from the LLMs. The raw response is passed back.  The newly added files (`evals.py`, `generate_code.py`, `home.py`, `screenshot.py`, `video\utils.py`, `ws\constants.py`) do not introduce any changes to this file or related sanitization logic.

    - **File: `backend\codegen\utils.py`**: This file contains the `extract_html_content` function, which aims to extract HTML code from a larger text response.
        - Code snippet from `codegen\utils.py`:
        ```python
        import re

        def extract_html_content(text: str):
            # Use regex to find content within <html> tags and include the tags themselves
            match = re.search(r"(<html.*?>.*?</html>)", text, re.DOTALL)
            if match:
                return match.group(1)
            else:
                # Otherwise, we just send the previous HTML over
                print(
                    "[HTML Extraction] No <html> tags found in the generated content: " + text
                )
                return text
        ```
        - **Analysis:** This function uses a regular expression to extract content within `<html>` tags. It does not perform any sanitization. If the LLM generates malicious code within these tags, it will be extracted and returned without modification. The newly added files do not modify this function or introduce any sanitization to the extracted HTML content.

    - **File: `backend\main.py` and `backend\routes\generate_code.py`**: These files set up the FastAPI application and define the API routes, including the code generation endpoint. They orchestrate the process but do not include sanitization logic.  Review of `backend\routes\generate_code.py` confirms that while it handles the code generation flow and error handling, it does not include any output sanitization before sending the generated code to the frontend.

    - **File: `backend\prompts\*`**: These files define the prompts sent to the LLMs. While the prompts instruct the AI to generate *clean* code, they do not explicitly instruct the AI to *sanitize* user input or prevent the inclusion of potentially malicious code if it appears in the input screenshot. The prompt focuses on visual accuracy and functionality, not security.

    - **File: `backend\mock_llm.py`**: This file provides mock responses for testing purposes. The mock responses themselves appear to be safe, but this file does not contribute to or mitigate the vulnerability in a real-world scenario.

    - **Visualization:**
        ```
        [Screenshot Upload] --> [Backend API Endpoint] --> [llm.py (LLM Call)] --> [AI Model (Generates Code)] --> [llm.py (Response Stream)] --> [codegen\utils.py (HTML Extraction)] --> [Backend API Response] --> [Frontend] --> [User Copies Code] --> [User's Website/Application] --> [Victim Browser (XSS Execution)]
        ```
        - **Flow analysis:** The data flow clearly shows that the AI-generated code, potentially containing malicious scripts from the screenshot, is passed through the backend and presented to the user without any sanitization step.  The newly added files and routes do not alter this data flow in a way that would introduce sanitization.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a malicious screenshot:**
        - Create a simple HTML page.
        - Embed a text input field in this page.
        - Set the `value` attribute of the input field to a malicious JavaScript payload, for example: `<input type="text" value="<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!')</script>">`.
        - Take a screenshot of this HTML page. Let's call it `malicious_screenshot.png`.
    2. **Upload the malicious screenshot:**
        - Access the hosted version of the screenshot-to-code application (http://localhost:5173 if running locally).
        - Upload `malicious_screenshot.png` to the application.
        - Select any stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind).
        - Click the "Generate Code" button.
    3. **Examine the generated code:**
        - Once the code is generated, carefully inspect the output HTML code.
        - Look for the input field. It is highly likely that the generated code will contain the malicious JavaScript payload directly within the `value` attribute, exactly as it was in the screenshot.
        - Example of vulnerable generated code snippet:
        ```html
        <input type="text" value="<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!')</script>" class="...">
        ```
    4. **Integrate the generated code into a test page:**
        - Copy the entire generated HTML code.
        - Create a new HTML file (e.g., `test_xss.html`) on your local machine.
        - Paste the generated code into the `<body>` of `test_xss.html`.
        - Open `test_xss.html` in a web browser.
    5. **Verify XSS execution:**
        - Upon opening `test_xss.html`, an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability!" should pop up.
        - This confirms that the malicious JavaScript code from the screenshot was successfully generated by the AI and is executed when the generated code is used, demonstrating a successful XSS exploit.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can successfully inject XSS vulnerabilities into the code generated by the screenshot-to-code application by crafting a malicious screenshot. The lack of output sanitization in the backend allows the malicious script to be carried through to the final generated code, posing a security risk to users who incorporate this code into their projects. The newly added files do not include any changes that would invalidate this test case or mitigate the vulnerability.
