- Vulnerability Name: Potential Image Processing Vulnerability via Malicious Image Upload
- Description:
    1. An attacker uploads a crafted image to the application through the image upload functionality.
    2. The backend, specifically the `process_image` function in `backend/image_processing/utils.py`, receives the image data as a data URL.
    3. The `process_image` function decodes the base64 data and opens the image using the PIL (Pillow) library.
    4. If the uploaded image is maliciously crafted to exploit a vulnerability in the PIL library, the `Image.open()` operation or subsequent processing steps within `process_image` (like resizing or re-compression) may trigger the vulnerability.
    5. Exploiting a PIL vulnerability could lead to various impacts, including but not limited to: denial of service (application crash), information disclosure (e.g., server file paths in error logs), or potentially remote code execution on the server, depending on the specific vulnerability in PIL.
- Impact: Depending on the nature of the exploited PIL vulnerability, the impact ranges from high to critical. A successful exploit could lead to:
    - High: Local denial of service (application crashes, preventing further use by legitimate users), or information disclosure (e.g., exposure of server configuration or internal file paths in error messages).
    - Critical: In a worst-case scenario, remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the backend system.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The provided code does not include explicit input validation or sanitization of image data URLs before processing them with the PIL library. The image processing within `process_image` focuses on resizing and re-encoding for Claude API compatibility, not on security validation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Validation: Implement robust validation of uploaded images before they are processed by PIL. This could include checks on file headers, image metadata, and potentially using safer image processing techniques.
    - Dependency Scanning: Regularly scan project dependencies, including PIL, for known security vulnerabilities and update to patched versions promptly.
    - Error Handling: Enhance error handling in `process_image` to gracefully manage potentially malicious or malformed images. Ensure that errors during image processing do not lead to application crashes or expose sensitive information in error messages.
    - Sandboxing: Consider sandboxing the image processing operations to limit the potential impact of a successful exploit. For example, running image processing in a separate, isolated process with restricted permissions.
- Preconditions:
    - The application must have a feature that allows users to upload images, and these images must be processed by the backend using the `process_image` function from `backend/image_processing/utils.py`.
    - A exploitable vulnerability must exist in the version of the PIL (Pillow) library used by the application. This vulnerability should be triggerable by processing a maliciously crafted image data URL.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `backend/image_processing/utils.py`
    2. Function: `process_image(image_data_url: str)`
    3. Vulnerable Line: `img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes))`
        - This line is where the PIL library opens the image file from bytes. If the `image_bytes` originates from a crafted data URL controlled by an attacker and exploits a vulnerability in PIL's `Image.open` function, it can lead to a security breach.
        - The function processes the image to ensure it meets Claude API requirements, including resizing and re-encoding, which may further interact with and potentially trigger vulnerabilities within the PIL library.
    ```python
    # backend/image_processing/utils.py
    def process_image(image_data_url: str) -> tuple[str, str]:
        # ...
        image_bytes = base64.b64decode(base64_data) # Decoding base64 from data URL
        img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes)) # Potential vulnerability point: PIL opens image
        # ... image processing logic ...
        return ("image/jpeg", base64.b64encode(output.getvalue()).decode("utf-8"))
    ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Preparation: Identify a known vulnerability in the PIL library that can be triggered by a crafted image file (e.g., a specific format vulnerability). If a public exploit exists, obtain or create a crafted image that triggers this vulnerability. If no known exploit is readily available, research potential image format vulnerabilities in PIL and attempt to create a malformed image that might trigger errors or unexpected behavior. Use a PIL version known to be vulnerable for testing if possible, mirroring the project's dependencies.
    2. Setup: Deploy a test instance of the `screenshot-to-code` application in a controlled environment where you can monitor server behavior and logs.
    3. Attack:
        - As an external attacker, access the application's user interface through a web browser.
        - Locate the image upload feature. This is typically the starting point for the screenshot-to-code conversion process.
        - Prepare a request to upload the crafted malicious image. This will likely involve encoding the image as a data URL and sending it as part of the request to the backend endpoint that handles image uploads and processing (e.g., `/generate_code` or similar, depending on the application routes which are not fully provided but can be inferred).
        - Send the crafted image upload request to the application.
    4. Observation and Verification:
        - Monitor the application's backend server for any signs of exploit. This includes:
            - Server-side errors or crashes: Check server logs for Python traceback errors, segmentation faults, or other indications of abnormal termination.
            - Resource consumption: Monitor CPU and memory usage for spikes that could indicate a denial-of-service condition due to inefficient image processing or an exploit.
            - Information Disclosure: Examine server logs and response messages for any leaked information, such as file paths, configuration details, or internal application data that might be exposed due to an error or vulnerability.
            - Remote Code Execution (if attempting to verify RCE): If the targeted PIL vulnerability is known to allow RCE, attempt to trigger it and verify code execution by trying to execute a simple command on the server (e.g., `whoami` or `ls /tmp`) and observing the output. This is a more advanced test and should be done in a safe, isolated testing environment.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Video Processing Vulnerability via Malicious Video Upload
- Description:
    1. An attacker uploads a crafted video to the application through the video upload functionality.
    2. The backend, specifically the `split_video_into_screenshots` function in `backend/video/utils.py`, receives the video data URL.
    3. The `split_video_into_screenshots` function decodes the base64 data, saves it to a temporary file, and uses `moviepy` to open and process the video. It then extracts frames as PIL images using `PIL.Image.fromarray`.
    4. If the uploaded video is maliciously crafted to exploit a vulnerability in the `moviepy` library during video opening or processing, or in the PIL library during frame conversion from array to image, it could trigger the vulnerability.
    5. Exploiting a `moviepy` or PIL vulnerability could lead to various impacts, similar to image processing vulnerabilities: denial of service, information disclosure, or potentially remote code execution.
- Impact: Depending on the nature of the exploited `moviepy` or PIL vulnerability, the impact ranges from high to critical. A successful exploit could lead to:
    - High: Local denial of service (application crashes, preventing further use by legitimate users), or information disclosure (e.g., exposure of server configuration or internal file paths in error messages).
    - Critical: In a worst-case scenario, remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the backend system.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The provided code does not include explicit input validation or sanitization of video data URLs before processing them with the `moviepy` and PIL libraries. The video processing focuses on splitting video into frames for Claude API compatibility, not on security validation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Validation: Implement robust validation of uploaded videos before they are processed by `moviepy` and PIL. This should include checks on video file headers, formats, and potentially using safer video processing techniques.
    - Dependency Scanning: Regularly scan project dependencies, including `moviepy` and PIL, for known security vulnerabilities and update to patched versions promptly.
    - Error Handling: Enhance error handling in `split_video_into_screenshots` to gracefully manage potentially malicious or malformed videos.
    - Sandboxing: Consider sandboxing the video processing operations to limit the potential impact of a successful exploit. For example, running video processing in a separate, isolated process with restricted permissions.
- Preconditions:
    - The application must have a feature that allows users to upload videos, and these videos must be processed by the backend using the `split_video_into_screenshots` function from `backend/video/utils.py`.
    - A exploitable vulnerability must exist in the version of the `moviepy` or PIL library used by the application. This vulnerability should be triggerable by processing a maliciously crafted video data URL.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `backend/video/utils.py`
    2. Function: `split_video_into_screenshots(video_data_url: str)`
    3. Vulnerable Lines: `clip = VideoFileClip(temp_video_file.name)` and `frame_image = Image.fromarray(frame)`
        - `VideoFileClip` from `moviepy` opens the video file from a temporary file. If the video data originates from a crafted data URL controlled by an attacker and exploits a vulnerability in `moviepy`'s `VideoFileClip` function, it can lead to a security breach.
        - Subsequently, `Image.fromarray(frame)` from PIL converts video frames (numpy arrays) into PIL Image objects. While `Image.fromarray` itself might be less prone to direct exploits compared to `Image.open`, vulnerabilities could still arise if `moviepy` manipulates video frames in a way that triggers a vulnerability during the array-to-image conversion within PIL.
    ```python
    # backend/video/utils.py
    def split_video_into_screenshots(video_data_url: str) -> list[Image.Image]:
        # ...
        video_bytes = base64.b64decode(video_encoded_data)
        # ...
        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=suffix, delete=True) as temp_video_file:
            temp_video_file.write(video_bytes)
            temp_video_file.flush()
            clip = VideoFileClip(temp_video_file.name) # Potential vulnerability point: moviepy opens video file
            # ... frame extraction ...
                frame_image = Image.fromarray(frame) # Potential vulnerability point: PIL converts array to image
                images.append(frame_image)
        # ...
        return images
    ```

If a public exploit exists, obtain or create a crafted video that triggers this vulnerability. If no known exploit is readily available, research potential video format vulnerabilities in `moviepy` and image processing vulnerabilities in PIL, and attempt to create a malformed video that might trigger errors or unexpected behavior. Use vulnerable versions of `moviepy` and PIL for testing if possible, mirroring the project's dependencies.
    2. Setup: Deploy a test instance of the `screenshot-to-code` application in a controlled environment where you can monitor server behavior and logs.
    3. Attack:
        - As an external attacker, access the application's user interface through a web browser.
        - Locate the video upload feature. This is typically part of the code generation process when using video input.
        - Prepare a request to upload the crafted malicious video. This will likely involve encoding the video as a data URL and sending it as part of the request to the backend websocket endpoint `/generate-code` with `inputMode` parameter set to `"video"`.
        - Send the crafted video upload request to the application via websocket.
    4. Observation and Verification:
        - Monitor the application's backend server for any signs of exploit. This includes:
            - Server-side errors or crashes: Check server logs for Python traceback errors, segmentation faults, or other indications of abnormal termination.
            - Resource consumption: Monitor CPU and memory usage for spikes that could indicate a denial-of-service condition due to inefficient video processing or an exploit.
