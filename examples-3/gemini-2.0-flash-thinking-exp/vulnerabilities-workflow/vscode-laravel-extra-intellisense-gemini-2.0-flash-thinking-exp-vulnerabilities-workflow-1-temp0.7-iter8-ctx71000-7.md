Please provide the list of vulnerabilities you want me to update. I need the list to be able to filter and format it according to your instructions.

Once you provide the list, I will:

1.  **Analyze each vulnerability** against your inclusion and exclusion criteria.
2.  **Filter out** vulnerabilities that do not meet the requirements.
3.  **Format the remaining vulnerabilities** in markdown, ensuring each entry includes:
    *   Vulnerability Name
    *   Description (step-by-step trigger instructions in the context of a malicious repository)
    *   Impact
    *   Vulnerability Rank (high or critical)
    *   Currently Implemented Mitigations
    *   Missing Mitigations
    *   Preconditions
    *   Source Code Analysis (detailed code walkthrough explaining how a malicious repository triggers it)
    *   Security Test Case (step-by-step test for an external attacker using a malicious repository)

I'm ready to process your list when you provide it.
