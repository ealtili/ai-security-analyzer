Okay, here is the updated list of vulnerabilities in markdown format, after reviewing against the provided instructions. Both vulnerabilities are included as they meet the inclusion criteria and do not fall under the exclusion criteria when considering an external attacker scenario and focusing on vulnerabilities within the application code itself, not just misuse of external libraries or missing documentation.

### - Vulnerability name: Information Disclosure via Accessible Debug Logs
- Description:
    1. The application has a debug logging feature controlled by the `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` environment variable in `backend/config.py`.
    2. When `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` is set to `True`, debug logs are written to files in a directory specified by the `DEBUG_DIR` environment variable, using `DebugFileWriter.py`.
    3. The `utils.py` file includes a `pprint_prompt` function that uses `json.dumps` to print and potentially log the prompts sent to the LLMs. This function is used in `llm.py`.
    4. If the `DEBUG_DIR` is set to a publicly accessible location or if there's a misconfiguration allowing access to these logs, an attacker could retrieve these log files via web browser if `DEBUG_DIR` is within web server's root or by directly accessing the file system if other misconfigurations exist.
    5. These log files may contain sensitive information, including:
        - Prompts sent to LLMs, which could contain screenshots or descriptions of user interfaces that might reveal business logic or sensitive data displayed in the UI.
        - Potentially parts of the generated code, which while less sensitive, could still reveal application logic.
- Impact:
    - High - An attacker could gain access to sensitive information from the application's debug logs. This could include insights into the application's functionality, business logic revealed in UI screenshots, or potentially sensitive data displayed within the user interfaces processed by the application.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The debug logging is controlled by the `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` environment variable, which is likely intended to be disabled in production environments.
    - The `DEBUG_DIR` environment variable allows configuration of the debug log directory.
- Missing mitigations:
    - **Secure default configuration**: Ensure `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` is set to `False` by default and strongly recommended to remain disabled in production.
    - **Access control for debug logs**: Implement strict access controls to the directory specified by `DEBUG_DIR` to prevent unauthorized access, even if debug logging is accidentally enabled in production. The application should ensure that the web server configuration prevents direct access to the debug logs directory from the public internet. For example, ensure that `DEBUG_DIR` is located outside of the web server's document root and that file system permissions restrict access to only the application user.
    - **Sensitive data scrubbing**: Implement measures to scrub or redact sensitive information from debug logs before they are written. This could involve preventing logging of full prompts or responses, or specifically redacting potentially sensitive data within the logged messages.
    - **Security review of logging**: Conduct a security review of all logging practices to ensure no sensitive data is inadvertently logged.
- Preconditions:
    - `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` environment variable is set to `True` in a publicly accessible instance of the application.
    - The directory specified by `DEBUG_DIR` is accessible to external attackers, either due to misconfiguration of the web server (e.g., `DEBUG_DIR` is within web server root) or insecure file system permissions on the server.
- Source code analysis:
    1. `backend/config.py`:
       ```python
       IS_DEBUG_ENABLED = bool(os.environ.get("IS_DEBUG_ENABLED", False))
       DEBUG_DIR = os.environ.get("DEBUG_DIR", "")
       ```
       - `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` and `DEBUG_DIR` are read from environment variables. `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` defaults to `False`.

    2. `backend/debug/DebugFileWriter.py`:
       ```python
       from config import DEBUG_DIR, IS_DEBUG_ENABLED

       class DebugFileWriter:
           def __init__(self):
               if not IS_DEBUG_ENABLED:
                   return
               # ... directory creation logic ...

           def write_to_file(self, filename: str, content: str) -> None:
               # ... file writing logic using DEBUG_DIR ...
       ```
       - `DebugFileWriter` is used to write debug files only when `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` is true and uses `DEBUG_DIR` to determine the output path.

    3. `backend/llm.py`:
       ```python
       from utils import pprint_prompt

       async def stream_claude_response_native(...):
           # ...
           pprint_prompt(messages_to_send)
           # ...

       async def stream_openai_response(...):
           # ...
           # No direct prompt logging in this function
           # ...

       async def stream_gemini_response(...):
           # ...
           # No direct prompt logging in this function
           # ...
       ```
       - `pprint_prompt` is called within `stream_claude_response_native`, potentially logging sensitive prompt data if debug logging is enabled. Note that other LLM response streams might also indirectly log prompts depending on the broader logging strategy of the application.

    4. `backend/utils.py`:
       ```python
       import json

       def pprint_prompt(prompt_messages: List[ChatCompletionMessageParam]):
           print(json.dumps(truncate_data_strings(prompt_messages), indent=4))
       ```
       - `pprint_prompt` function serializes prompt messages using `json.dumps` and prints them to standard output, which can be captured by logging mechanisms if configured.

    5. Visualization:
       ```mermaid
       graph LR
           A[Request to Backend] --> B(llm.py: stream_claude_response_native);
           B --> C(utils.py: pprint_prompt);
           C -- IS_DEBUG_ENABLED=True --> D[DebugFileWriter.py: write_to_file];
           D --> E(Debug Logs in DEBUG_DIR);
           C -- IS_DEBUG_ENABLED=False --> F[No logs];
           E -- Publicly Accessible --> G[Attacker Access to Logs];
           G --> H(Information Disclosure);
       ```

- Security test case:
    1. Deploy the `screenshot-to-code` application in a test environment accessible over the internet or local network.
    2. Set the environment variable `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED=true` and configure `DEBUG_DIR` to a directory within the web server's document root (e.g., `/var/www/html/debug_logs` if the web server root is `/var/www/html`). Alternatively, for a local test, set `DEBUG_DIR` to a known path on your system and ensure the web server can serve files from that directory if simulating public access via web browser.
    3. Send a request to the backend through the application's UI or API to generate code from a screenshot. The screenshot should contain example UI elements and text.
    4. Using a web browser, navigate to the `DEBUG_DIR` location via the application's URL (e.g., `http://your-app-domain/debug_logs/`). If `DEBUG_DIR` is correctly placed under the web server root and accessible, you should be able to list the log files.
    5. Open and download the latest log file.
    6. Examine the content of the downloaded log file.
    7. Verify that the log file contains the prompt messages sent to the LLM, including the base64 encoded image data from the screenshot and any text prompts.
    8. If you can successfully access and view the logs containing the prompt information via the web browser, the vulnerability is confirmed, demonstrating information disclosure to an external attacker.

### - Vulnerability name: Path Traversal in Evaluation Endpoints
- Description:
    1. The `get_evals`, `get_pairwise_evals`, and `get_best_of_n_evals` endpoints in `backend/routes/evals.py` are intended to retrieve evaluation files. They take folder paths as input parameters (`folder`, `folder1`, `folder2`, etc.) via URL query parameters.
    2. These endpoints use `os.listdir` and `os.path.join` to list files within and construct full paths from the provided folder parameters to access evaluation data files, specifically looking for `.html` files.
    3. The application performs a basic check using `os.path.exists()` to verify if the provided folder exists, but it does not sanitize or validate the folder paths to prevent path traversal attacks.
    4. An attacker can craft a malicious URL request to these endpoints by providing folder paths containing path traversal sequences such as `../../../` in the query parameters.
    5. When the backend processes these requests, the `os.listdir` and `os.path.join` operations, combined with the unsanitized path, will resolve to a path outside the intended evaluation directories, potentially allowing access to arbitrary files and directories on the server's file system that the application has read permissions for.
    6. By exploiting this, an attacker could read sensitive files like configuration files, application source code, or other data that the server user running the application has access to.
- Impact:
    - High - An attacker could read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files, source code, or data. The severity is high because it allows for unauthorized access to sensitive server-side information, which can lead to further compromise.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The code checks if the provided folder exists using `os.path.exists()` before attempting to list files. This offers a minimal level of protection against non-existent paths but does not prevent path traversal within existing paths or to parent directories.
- Missing mitigations:
    - **Input validation and sanitization**: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for the `folder`, `folder1`, `folder2`, etc., parameters in the evaluation endpoints. This should include:
        - **Path canonicalization**: Convert the user-provided path to its canonical, absolute form and validate that it starts with the intended base directory for evaluations. This prevents bypassing sanitization by using relative paths or symlinks.
        - **Path traversal sequence removal**:  Actively remove or reject requests containing path traversal sequences like `../` and `./`. Regular expressions or dedicated path sanitization libraries can be used.
        - **Safe path joining**: Utilize secure path joining functions that prevent traversal outside a defined base directory.  Ensure that the application logic restricts access to only the intended evaluation file directories and their subdirectories.
        - **Whitelist approach**: If possible, instead of relying on blacklist or sanitization, use a whitelist approach where only predefined and validated folder names or paths are accepted.
    - **Restrict file system permissions**: Configure file system permissions such that the application user has the minimum necessary permissions. Ideally, the application user should only have read access to the evaluation directories and not to sensitive system files or other application directories. This limits the scope of what an attacker can access even if path traversal is successfully exploited.
- Preconditions:
    - The application is deployed and accessible to external attackers over the internet or local network.
    - An attacker discovers or infers the existence of the `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, or `/best-of-n-evals` endpoints and identifies that they accept folder paths as query parameters.
- Source code analysis:
    1. `backend/routes/evals.py`:
       - `get_evals(folder: str)`:
         ```python
         folder_path = Path(folder)
         if not folder_path.exists():
             raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=f"Folder not found: {folder}")
         files = {
             f: os.path.join(folder, f)
             for f in os.listdir(folder)
             if f.endswith(".html")
         }
         ```
       - `get_pairwise_evals(folder1: str, folder2: str)`:
         ```python
         if not os.path.exists(folder1) or not os.path.exists(folder2):
             return {"error": "One or both folders do not exist"}
         files1 = {
             f: os.path.join(folder1, f) for f in os.listdir(folder1) if f.endswith(".html")
         }
         files2 = {
             f: os.path.join(folder2, f) for f in os.listdir(folder2) if f.endswith(".html")
         }
         ```
       - `get_best_of_n_evals(request: Request)`:
         ```python
         folders = []
         i = 1
         while f"folder{i}" in query_params:
             folders.append(query_params[f"folder{i}"])
             i += 1
         for folder in folders:
             if not os.path.exists(folder):
                 return {"error": f"Folder does not exist: {folder}"}
         files_by_folder = []
         for folder in folders:
             files = {
                 f: os.path.join(folder, f)
                 for f in os.listdir(folder)
                 if f.endswith(".html")
             }
             files_by_folder.append(files)
         ```
       - The code directly uses the `folder`, `folder1`, `folder2` parameters from the request in `os.listdir` and `os.path.join` without any sanitization against path traversal attacks. The `os.path.exists()` check is insufficient as it only verifies the existence of the final, potentially traversed path, not the validity or safety of the path itself.

    2. Visualization:
       ```mermaid
       graph LR
           A[Attacker Request with Traversal Path] --> B(/evals endpoint);
           B -- folder parameter --> C(evals.py: get_evals);
           C -- unsanitized folder path --> D(os.listdir/os.path.join);
           D -- Traversal attempt --> E[File System Access outside intended folder];
           E --> F[Arbitrary File Read];
       ```

- Security test case:
    1. Deploy the `screenshot-to-code` application in a test environment accessible over the internet or local network.
    2. Identify the evaluation endpoints: `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, `/best-of-n-evals`.
    3. For the `/evals` endpoint, craft a GET request to `/evals?folder=../../../etc/passwd`.
    4. Send the crafted request to the application using a web browser or `curl`: `curl "http://your-app-domain/evals?folder=../../../etc/passwd"`.
    5. Examine the HTTP response from the server.
    6. If the application is vulnerable to path traversal, the response body will likely contain the content of the `/etc/passwd` file. Alternatively, you might receive an error message indicating that the application attempted to access `/etc/passwd`, which still confirms the vulnerability even if direct file content is not returned due to response handling. Look for any output that suggests file system access outside of expected evaluation folders.
    7. Repeat steps 3-6 for `/pairwise-evals?folder1=../../../etc/passwd&folder2=./` and `/best-of-n-evals?folder1=../../../etc/passwd&folder2=./` to test these endpoints as well.
    8. For further verification and to assess impact, attempt to access other sensitive files or directories accessible to the application user, such as application configuration files or source code, using similar path traversal techniques.
    9. Successful retrieval of files outside the intended evaluation directories confirms the path traversal vulnerability in the evaluation endpoints.
