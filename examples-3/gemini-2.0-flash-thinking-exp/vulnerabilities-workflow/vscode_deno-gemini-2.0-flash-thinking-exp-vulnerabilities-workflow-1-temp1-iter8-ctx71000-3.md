Based on your instructions, here is the updated list of vulnerabilities. Both provided vulnerabilities meet the inclusion criteria and do not fall under the exclusion criteria.

### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Deno Test Code Lens via `deno.codeLens.testArgs`

* Description:
    1. The VSCode Deno extension allows users to configure test arguments via the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting.
    2. This setting is used to construct the command line arguments when running tests through the "Run Test" code lens.
    3. The extension directly passes these arguments to the `vscode.ProcessExecution` without proper sanitization.
    4. A malicious user can craft a workspace with a `.vscode/settings.json` file that injects arbitrary commands into `deno.codeLens.testArgs`.
    5. When a victim opens this workspace and clicks "Run Test" code lens, the injected commands will be executed by the system.

* Impact:
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

* Vulnerability Rank: critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly uses the user-provided `deno.codeLens.testArgs` without any validation or sanitization.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting. The extension should validate and sanitize any arguments provided in this setting to prevent command injection.
    - Restrict allowed characters or patterns in `deno.codeLens.testArgs`.
    - Warn users about the risks of modifying workspace settings from untrusted sources.

* Preconditions:
    - Victim opens a workspace containing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets a malicious value for `deno.codeLens.testArgs`.
    - Deno extension is enabled in the workspace.
    - Victim clicks "Run Test" code lens on a test function in a JavaScript or TypeScript file within the workspace.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `client/src/commands.ts`
    2. Function: `test`
    3. Line: `const testArgs: string[] = [...(config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs") ?? []),];` - Retrieves `deno.codeLens.testArgs` from workspace configuration.
    4. Line: `const args = ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", nameRegex, filePath];` - Constructs the command arguments by directly including `testArgs`.
    5. Line:
    ```typescript
    const definition: tasks.DenoTaskDefinition = {
        type: tasks.TASK_TYPE,
        command: "test",
        args,
        env,
    };
    ```
       Creates a `DenoTaskDefinition` with unsanitized `args`.
    6. File: `client/src/tasks.ts`
    7. Function: `buildDenoTask`
    8. Line:
    ```typescript
    const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
        process,
        args,
        definition,
    );
    ```
       Creates `vscode.ProcessExecution` with potentially malicious `args`, leading to command injection.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new directory named `vscode_deno_test_rce`.
    2. Inside `vscode_deno_test_rce`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
    ```json
    {
        "deno.enable": true,
        "deno.codeLens.testArgs": [
            "--allow-read",
            "--allow-write",
            "--allow-run",
            "; touch malicious_file_test_args; #"
        ]
    }
    ```
    4. Inside `vscode_deno_test_rce`, create a file named `test.ts` with the following content:
    ```typescript
    Deno.test("testExample", () => {
        console.log("Running test");
    });
    ```
    5. Open the `vscode_deno_test_rce` directory in VSCode. Ensure the Deno extension is activated.
    6. Open `test.ts`. You should see the "▶ Run Test" code lens above `Deno.test`.
    7. Click on "▶ Run Test".
    8. After the test execution completes, check the `vscode_deno_test_rce` directory. A file named `malicious_file_test_args` will be created, indicating successful command injection.

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Deno Upgrade via `deno.unstable` setting

* Description:
    1. The VSCode Deno extension uses the `deno.unstable` setting to determine unstable features to enable during Deno upgrade process.
    2. This setting is used to construct command-line arguments for the `deno upgrade` command.
    3. The extension directly uses the values from `deno.unstable` without sanitization, passing them to `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
    4. A malicious user can create a workspace with a crafted `.vscode/settings.json` file to inject arbitrary commands through `deno.unstable`.
    5. When a victim opens this workspace and triggers the "Deno: Upgrade" command (either manually or via prompt), the injected commands will be executed by the system.

* Impact:
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to full system compromise.

* Vulnerability Rank: critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly uses user-provided `deno.unstable` values in command construction.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for `deno.unstable` setting. The extension should validate and sanitize the values in `deno.unstable` to prevent command injection.
    - Restrict allowed characters or patterns in `deno.unstable`.
    - Warn users about the risks of modifying workspace settings from untrusted sources.

* Preconditions:
    - Victim opens a workspace containing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets a malicious value in `deno.unstable`.
    - Deno extension is enabled.
    - Victim executes the "Deno: Upgrade" command (e.g., via command palette or prompted by the extension).

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `client/src/upgrade.ts`
    2. Function: `denoUpgradePromptAndExecute`
    3. Line: `const unstable = config.get("unstable") as string[] ?? [];` - Retrieves `deno.unstable` from workspace configuration.
    4. Line:
    ```typescript
    for (const unstableFeature of unstable) {
        args.push(`--unstable-${unstableFeature}`);
    }
    ```
       Constructs command arguments by directly using values from `unstable` setting.
    5. File: `client/src/tasks.ts` (via `buildDenoTask` called from `upgrade.ts`)
    6. Function: `buildDenoTask`
    7. Line:
    ```typescript
    const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
        process,
        args,
        definition,
    );
    ```
       Creates `vscode.ProcessExecution` with potentially malicious `args`, leading to command injection.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new directory named `vscode_deno_upgrade_rce`.
    2. Inside `vscode_deno_upgrade_rce`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
    ```json
    {
        "deno.enable": true,
        "deno.unstable": [
            "sloppy-imports",
            "; touch malicious_file_upgrade_unstable; #"
        ]
    }
    ```
    4. Open the `vscode_deno_upgrade_rce` directory in VSCode. Ensure the Deno extension is activated.
    5. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and execute "Deno: Upgrade". You may need to have an older version of Deno CLI installed for the upgrade prompt to appear, or you can manually trigger the command if the prompt doesn't show up.
    6. Confirm the upgrade if prompted.
    7. After the upgrade process completes (or starts), check the `vscode_deno_upgrade_rce` directory. A file named `malicious_file_upgrade_unstable` will be created, indicating successful command injection.
