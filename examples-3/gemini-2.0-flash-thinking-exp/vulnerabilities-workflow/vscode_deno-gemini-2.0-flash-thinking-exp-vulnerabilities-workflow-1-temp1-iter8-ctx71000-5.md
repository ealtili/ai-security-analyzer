### Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in Deno Tasks

- **Description:**
    1. A threat actor creates a malicious repository containing a `tasks.json` file.
    2. The `tasks.json` file defines a Deno task with a crafted `args` field that includes shell commands. For example, an attacker could insert malicious code within the arguments of a task definition, like so: `"; touch injected.txt"`.
    3. The victim opens this malicious repository in VSCode with the Deno extension enabled.
    4. The victim, unaware of the malicious task, might explore the "Tasks" panel provided by VSCode or be tricked into running the malicious task.
    5. When the victim runs the task, the Deno extension executes the command specified in `tasks.json` using `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
    6. Due to insufficient sanitization of the `args` field, the injected shell commands are executed by the system shell.

- **Impact:**
    - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to:
        - Data exfiltration: Stealing sensitive files and information from the victim's system.
        - Malware installation: Installing viruses, ransomware, or other malicious software.
        - System compromise: Gaining full control over the victim's system, potentially joining it to a botnet or using it for further attacks.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The extension directly uses user-provided task definitions from `tasks.json` to construct and execute shell commands via `vscode.ProcessExecution` without any input sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement strict input sanitization for the `args` field in `DenoTaskDefinition` to prevent injection of shell commands. Validate and escape user-provided arguments before passing them to `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
    - **Command Parameterization:** If possible, utilize parameterized commands or APIs that inherently prevent command injection, instead of directly constructing shell commands from user inputs.  However, `vscode.ProcessExecution` inherently relies on shell execution.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** While not a direct mitigation, running the extension and Deno CLI with the least necessary privileges can limit the impact of a successful command injection.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. Victim must have the VSCode Deno extension installed and enabled.
    2. Victim must open a malicious repository containing a crafted `tasks.json` file.
    3. Victim must execute the malicious Deno task defined in `tasks.json`.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File: `client\src\tasks.ts`**
    2. Function `buildDenoTask` and `buildDenoConfigTask` are used to create `vscode.Task` objects.
    3. These functions take `DenoTaskDefinition` as input, which includes `command` and `args` from user-provided task configurations.
    4. **Line 42:** `const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(process, args, definition);` in `buildDenoTask` creates a `ProcessExecution` directly using the `args` from the `definition` without any sanitization.
    5. **Line 71:** `new vscode.ProcessExecution(process, ["task", ...args])` in `buildDenoConfigTask` similarly creates a `ProcessExecution` with potentially unsanitized arguments.

    ```typescript
    // Visualization of vulnerable code path in client\src\tasks.ts

    // Function buildDenoTask
    function buildDenoTask(
      target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
      process: string,
      definition: DenoTaskDefinition, // DenoTaskDefinition contains user-controlled "args"
      name: string,
      args: string[],                 // "args" is passed directly from definition
      problemMatchers: string[],
    ): vscode.Task {
      const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution( // Vulnerable point: ProcessExecution uses unsanitized "args"
        process,
        args,                           // args is directly used here
        definition,
      );

      return new vscode.Task( /* ... */ );
    }
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a new directory named `vscode_deno_test_repo`.
    2. Inside `vscode_deno_test_repo`, create a file named `tasks.json` with the following content:
    ```json
    {
      "version": "2.0.0",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "type": "deno",
          "command": "run",
          "args": [
            "`; touch injected.txt`"
          ],
          "problemMatcher": [
            "$deno"
          ],
          "label": "deno: malicious task"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    3. Open VSCode and open the `vscode_deno_test_repo` folder.
    4. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace (if not enabled globally).
    5. Open the VSCode Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
    6. Type and select "Tasks: Run Task".
    7. From the task list, select "deno: malicious task".
    8. After the task execution completes (it might show errors, this is expected), check the `vscode_deno_test_repo` directory.
    9. Verify if a file named `injected.txt` has been created in the `vscode_deno_test_repo` directory.
    10. If `injected.txt` is present, it confirms the command injection vulnerability.
