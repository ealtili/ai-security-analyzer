### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Deno Executable Path
- Description:
  1. The Visual Studio Code Deno extension allows users to configure the path to the Deno executable using the `deno.path` setting.
  2. A malicious actor can trick a user into changing this setting to point to a manipulated executable file instead of the legitimate Deno CLI. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by compromising the user's settings file.
  3. When the extension attempts to use the Deno CLI for various functionalities (like language server, formatting, linting, testing, etc.), it will execute the malicious executable specified in `deno.path`.
  4. This execution happens without any validation of the executable's legitimacy or location.
  5. As a result, the malicious executable will run with the privileges of the user running Visual Studio Code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
- Impact:
  Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a malicious actor to achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This could lead to:
    - Complete compromise of the user's system and data.
    - Installation of malware, spyware, or ransomware.
    - Data exfiltration.
    - Privilege escalation within the user's system.
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The code directly uses the path provided in the `deno.path` setting without any validation or sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input validation and sanitization for the `deno.path` setting:
    - Verify that the path points to a valid executable file.
    - Implement checks to ensure the path is within expected locations (e.g., check against a list of allowed directories or system paths).
    - Consider using a file hash or digital signature verification to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the Deno executable.
  - User awareness and security education:
    - Clearly document the security risks associated with modifying the `deno.path` setting.
    - Warn users against setting `deno.path` to executables from untrusted sources.
    - Provide best practices for secure configuration of the extension.
- Preconditions:
  1. The user must have the Visual Studio Code Deno extension installed and enabled.
  2. The attacker must trick the user into modifying the `deno.path` setting in their VS Code configuration to point to a malicious executable.
  3. The extension must be triggered to use the Deno CLI after the `deno.path` setting has been maliciously modified. This can happen automatically when opening a Deno project or manually when using Deno extension features.
- Source Code Analysis:

  1. **`client\src\util.ts:getDenoCommandPath()`**:
     ```typescript
     export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
       const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
       const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
       if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
         return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
       } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
         // if sent a relative path, iterate over workspace folders to try and resolve.
         for (const workspace of workspaceFolders) {
           const commandPath = path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command);
           if (await fileExists(commandPath)) {
             return commandPath;
           }
         }
         return undefined;
       } else {
         return command;
       }
     }

     function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
       const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)
         .get<string>("path");
       // it is possible for the path to be blank. In that case, return undefined
       if (typeof exePath === "string" && exePath.trim().length === 0) {
         return undefined;
       } else {
         return exePath;
       }
     }
     ```
     - This code is responsible for retrieving the Deno command path.
     - `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` directly reads the `deno.path` setting from the VS Code configuration without any validation.
     - `getDenoCommandPath()` attempts to resolve relative paths within workspace folders but does not perform any checks on absolute paths or ensure the path points to a legitimate Deno executable.

  2. **`client\src\commands.ts:startLanguageServer()`**:
     ```typescript
     export function startLanguageServer(
       context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
       extensionContext: DenoExtensionContext,
     ): Callback {
       return async () => {
         // ...
         const command = await getDenoCommandPath();
         if (command == null) {
           // ... error handling ...
           return;
         }

         const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
           run: {
             command, // Unvalidated path from deno.path setting
             args: ["lsp"],
             options: { env },
           },
           debug: {
             command, // Unvalidated path from deno.path setting
             // ...
             args: ["lsp"],
             options: { env },
           },
         };
         const client = new LanguageClient(
           // ...
           serverOptions,
           // ...
         );
         // ... client start ...
       };
     }
     ```
     - `startLanguageServer()` calls `getDenoCommandPath()` to get the Deno command.
     - The `command` obtained from `getDenoCommandPath()` is directly used in `serverOptions.run.command` and `serverOptions.debug.command` without any further validation.
     - The `LanguageClient` then uses these `command` values to spawn the Deno language server process.
     - **Visualization:**

     ```
     [VSCode Deno Extension] --> getDenoCommandPath() --> reads deno.path setting (NO VALIDATION)
                           |
                           |--> startLanguageServer() --> uses unvalidated path as command in LanguageClient
                           |
                           |--> LanguageClient --> spawns process with unvalidated command (Arbitrary Code Execution)
     ```

  **Conclusion from Source Code Analysis:**
  - The `deno.path` setting is read directly from the configuration without any validation or sanitization.
  - This unvalidated path is then directly used to execute a process when the extension starts the language server or utilizes other Deno CLI functionalities.
  - This lack of validation creates a critical vulnerability, allowing arbitrary code execution if a malicious executable path is provided in `deno.path`.

- Security Test Case:

  1. **Prerequisites:**
     - Install the VSCode Deno extension.
     - Have a Deno project or any JavaScript/TypeScript project open in VS Code.
     - Create a malicious executable file (e.g., `malicious_deno.bat` on Windows or `malicious_deno.sh` on Linux/macOS) that performs some harmful action (e.g., displays a warning message, creates a file, or attempts network communication).
     - Example `malicious_deno.bat`:
       ```bat
       @echo off
       echo [WARNING] Malicious Deno Executable is running!
       echo This is a security test to demonstrate arbitrary code execution.
       pause
       ```
     - Example `malicious_deno.sh`:
       ```sh
       #!/bin/bash
       echo "[WARNING] Malicious Deno Executable is running!"
       echo "This is a security test to demonstrate arbitrary code execution."
       read -p "Press Enter to continue"
       ```

  2. **Steps to Reproduce:**
     - Open VS Code settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings).
     - Search for "deno.path".
     - In the "Deno â€º Path" setting, enter the absolute path to your malicious executable file (e.g., `C:\path\to\malicious_deno.bat` or `/path/to/malicious_deno.sh`).
     - Ensure that Deno extension is enabled (`deno.enable`: true or by having a `deno.json` file in the workspace root).
     - Restart Visual Studio Code or reload the window (Developer: Reload Window).
     - Observe the execution of the malicious executable. The warning message or harmful action defined in your malicious executable should be triggered, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.

  3. **Expected Result:**
     - The malicious executable specified in `deno.path` is executed when the Deno extension starts or attempts to use the Deno CLI.
     - The user observes the harmful actions defined in the malicious executable, confirming arbitrary code execution.

  4. **Pass/Fail Criteria:**
     - **Pass:** The malicious executable is successfully executed, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.
     - **Fail:** The malicious executable is not executed, or the extension prevents the user from setting a malicious path, or input validation prevents the vulnerability. In this case, the test should PASS because of implemented mitigation (but currently there is no mitigation).

This security test case successfully demonstrates the Arbitrary Code Execution vulnerability.
