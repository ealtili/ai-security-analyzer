### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Command Injection via Deno Task Name in Tasks Sidebar

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Deno Task Name in Tasks Sidebar
- **Description:**
    - A threat actor can create a malicious repository containing a `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` file with a crafted task name.
    - When the victim opens this repository in VSCode with the vscode_deno extension, the extension reads the task definitions from the configuration file and displays them in the Deno Tasks Sidebar.
    - If the task name in `deno.json` is maliciously crafted to include shell commands, and the extension directly uses this task name in a shell command without proper sanitization, it could lead to command injection when the user attempts to run or debug the task from the sidebar.
    - The vulnerability is triggered when the user interacts with the maliciously named task in the sidebar, specifically by attempting to "Debug Task". The "Run Task" command in the sidebar does not appear to be vulnerable in the same way, as it directly executes the task defined in `deno.json` without using the task name in a shell command. However, the "Debug Task" command in `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider.#debugTask` constructs a shell command string using the task name.
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process when the victim attempts to debug the malicious task from the sidebar.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The code directly uses the task name in constructing shell commands for debugging.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Task names from `deno.json` should be sanitized or treated as data, not code, especially when used in shell commands.
    - When constructing shell commands, use parameterized execution methods to avoid injection, or ensure proper escaping of shell metacharacters.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Victim must have the vscode_deno extension installed and enabled.
    - Victim must open a malicious repository containing a `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` file with a crafted task name.
    - Victim must attempt to "Debug Task" from the Deno Tasks Sidebar for the malicious task.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`
    - Function: `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider.#debugTask(task: DenoTask)`
    - Code Snippet:
      ```typescript
      async #debugTask(task: DenoTask) {
        const command = `${await getDenoCommandName()} task ${task.task.name}`;
        commands.executeCommand(
          "extension.js-debug.createDebuggerTerminal",
          command,
          task.getFolder(),
          {
            cwd: path.dirname(task.denoJson.resourceUri!.fsPath),
          },
        );
      }
      ```
      - In this function, `task.task.name` which originates from the `deno.json` configuration file, is directly interpolated into a shell command string: ``${await getDenoCommandName()} task ${task.task.name}``.
      - `commands.executeCommand("extension.js-debug.createDebuggerTerminal", command, ...)` then executes this command string in a terminal.
      - If `task.task.name` contains malicious shell commands, these commands will be executed due to the command string interpolation and execution via `createDebuggerTerminal`.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a malicious repository.
    2. In the root of the repository, create a `deno.json` file with the following content:
       ```jsonc
       {
         "tasks": {
           "malicious-task && calc": "echo 'Malicious Task'"
         }
       }
       ```
       Here, the task name is crafted to be `malicious-task && calc`. The `&& calc` part is a command injection payload that will attempt to execute the `calc` command (calculator on Windows, or equivalent on other systems) after the intended task command.
    3. Open this malicious repository in VSCode with the vscode_deno extension enabled.
    4. Open the Deno Tasks Sidebar (if not already visible, you may need to trigger task discovery, for example by opening a `.ts` file).
    5. Locate the "malicious-task && calc" task in the sidebar.
    6. Right-click on the "malicious-task && calc" task and select "Debug Task".
    7. Observe that the calculator application (`calc.exe` on Windows) is launched, indicating successful command injection.
