### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Deno Executable Path Configuration
- Description:
    - Step 1: An attacker persuades a user to modify the `deno.path` setting in VS Code. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by compromising a user's settings synchronization.
    - Step 2: The user, believing they are improving or customizing their Deno extension setup, sets the `deno.path` setting to point to a malicious executable instead of the legitimate Deno CLI binary.
    - Step 3: The VS Code Deno extension, upon activation or when triggering any Deno-related feature (like formatting, linting, caching, testing, or debugging), attempts to execute the Deno CLI.
    - Step 4: Instead of executing the real Deno CLI, the extension unknowingly executes the malicious executable specified in the `deno.path` setting.
    - Step 5: The malicious executable runs with the privileges of the VS Code process, potentially allowing the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the user's system, such as data theft, malware installation, or system compromise.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
    - Full compromise of the user's local system with the privileges of the user running VS Code.
    - Potential data exfiltration, malware installation, or further malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Documentation Warning: The extension's README.md includes a warning in the "Important" section, advising users to ensure `deno.path` points to the legitimate Deno CLI and providing a link to Deno CLI installation instructions.
        - File: `vscode_deno\README.md`
        - Content Snippet:
          ```markdown
          > ⚠️ **Important:** You need to have a version of Deno CLI installed (v1.13.0 or
          > later). The extension requires the executable and by default will use the
          > environment path. You can explicitly set the path to the executable in Visual
          > Studio Code Settings for `deno.path`.
          >
          > [Check here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/) for instructions on how to
          > install the Deno CLI.
          ```
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Validation: Lack of validation for the `deno.path` setting. The extension should validate that the provided path is a valid executable and potentially warn if it points to a suspicious location (e.g., user-writable directories, temporary folders).
    - Executable Integrity Check: Missing integrity check for the executable specified in `deno.path`. The extension could implement checks to verify the authenticity or signature of the Deno CLI executable, although this might be complex to implement robustly across platforms.
    - Security Warning on Setting Change: Absence of a security warning when a user modifies the `deno.path` setting, especially if the new path is outside of standard program installation directories. A warning could alert users to the security implications of pointing this setting to untrusted executables.
- Preconditions:
    - User Installs VS Code Deno Extension: The user must have the `denoland.vscode-deno` extension installed in Visual Studio Code.
    - User Modifies `deno.path` Setting: The attacker needs to trick the user into manually changing the `deno.path` setting within VS Code's settings to point to a malicious executable.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Vulnerable Code Location: `client\src\util.ts` in the `getDenoCommandPath` function.
    - Step-by-step analysis:
        - 1. Function `getDenoCommandPath` is called to determine the path to the Deno executable.
        - 2. It retrieves the configured path from VS Code settings using `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`. This function reads the `deno.path` setting.
        - 3. If `deno.path` is configured (and is not blank), `getDenoCommandPath` prioritizes this user-defined path.
        - 4. If `deno.path` is not set or is blank, the function falls back to searching for 'deno' in the system's PATH and default installation directories (`getDefaultDenoCommand`).
        - 5. **Vulnerability:** The code directly uses the path from `deno.path` setting without any validation or security checks. If a malicious path is provided, it will be used to execute commands.
        - 6. The resolved command path is then used in `client\src\commands.ts` to spawn the Deno language server process and in `client\src\debug_config_provider.ts` for debugging and tasks execution.
    - Visualization:
      ```
      UserSettings (deno.path) --> getDenoCommandPath() --> ProcessExecution (client/src/commands.ts, client/src/debug_config_provider.ts) --> System Command Execution
      ```
- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Setup - Install VS Code and the Deno extension. Create a malicious script file, for example `malicious_deno.sh` (for Linux/macOS) or `malicious_deno.bat` (for Windows), which contains code to demonstrate arbitrary command execution (e.g., display a message and create a file in a temporary directory).
        - Example `malicious_deno.sh`:
          ```bash
          #!/bin/bash
          echo "Malicious Deno Executable is running!"
          date > /tmp/malicious_execution.txt
          ```
        - Make the script executable (`chmod +x malicious_deno.sh`).
    - Step 2: Configuration - Open VS Code settings and locate the `deno.path` setting. Set the value of `deno.path` to the absolute path of the malicious script (e.g., `/path/to/malicious_deno.sh`).
    - Step 3: Trigger Vulnerability - Open any Deno or TypeScript project in VS Code. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and execute the command "Deno: Cache". This action triggers the extension to invoke the Deno CLI.
    - Step 4: Verification - Check the output. You should see the message "Malicious Deno Executable is running!" in the terminal or output window depending on how the extension handles output. Verify that the file `/tmp/malicious_execution.txt` has been created, confirming that the malicious script was executed instead of the real Deno CLI.
