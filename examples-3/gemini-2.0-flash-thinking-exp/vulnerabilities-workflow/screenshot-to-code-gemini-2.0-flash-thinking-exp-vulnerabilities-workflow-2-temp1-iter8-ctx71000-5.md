### Vulnerability 1: Lack of Output Sanitization leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious screenshot designed to inject JavaScript code into the HTML output generated by the AI. This could include images with `onerror` attributes, or text content that, when processed by the AI and converted into HTML, results in inline JavaScript execution.
    2. The attacker uploads this crafted screenshot to the application via the frontend, using the image-to-code conversion feature.
    3. The backend processes the screenshot using an AI model (like GPT-4 Vision or Claude) to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Due to the nature of AI and the lack of specific instructions to prevent JavaScript injection, the generated code may inadvertently include the malicious JavaScript from the attacker's crafted screenshot.
    4. The backend sends this generated code back to the frontend, via a WebSocket connection in the `/generate-code` endpoint.
    5. The frontend receives the AI-generated code via WebSocket messages and renders it in the user's browser, likely to display the code for preview or editing.
    6. If the frontend does not sanitize the generated HTML code before rendering it, the malicious JavaScript embedded in the AI-generated code will be executed in the browser of any user who views the generated output. This results in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

* Impact:
    * **High**. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of any user who views the AI-generated output. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
        * **Account Takeover:** Stealing session cookies or credentials to impersonate users.
        * **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information from the user's browser, such as personal data, API keys stored in local storage, or other application data.
        * **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or injecting malware into the application.
        * **Defacement:** Altering the appearance or functionality of the web page as viewed by the user.
        * **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms to steal user credentials.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * **None**. Based on the provided source code, there is no evidence of any output sanitization being performed on the AI-generated code, either on the backend or the frontend. The code in `backend/codegen/utils.py` focuses on extracting HTML content but not on sanitizing it. The `main.py`, `llm.py`, `generate_code.py` and other backend files do not include any sanitization logic.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Backend Output Sanitization:** Implement robust HTML sanitization on the backend, before sending the generated code to the frontend. This should remove or neutralize any potentially malicious JavaScript or HTML elements (e.g., using a library like Bleach in Python for backend).
    * **Frontend Output Sanitization:** Implement a secondary layer of HTML sanitization on the frontend, before rendering the generated code in the browser. This acts as a defense-in-depth measure in case backend sanitization is bypassed or fails.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources and to restrict inline JavaScript execution. This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by preventing the execution of attacker-injected scripts.
    * **Input Validation (Limited Effectiveness):** While challenging to implement effectively for image inputs intended for AI processing, some basic input validation could be considered. However, relying solely on input validation to prevent XSS is generally not recommended.

* Preconditions:
    * An attacker needs to be able to upload a screenshot to the application.
    * The application must process this screenshot using AI and generate code based on it.
    * The generated code must be displayed to other users in the frontend without proper sanitization.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`backend/llm.py`**: (Previously analyzed and remains the same) This file handles communication with AI models. The AI response, which can contain malicious code, is directly returned without sanitization.

    2. **`backend/codegen/utils.py`**: (Previously analyzed and remains the same) The `extract_html_content` function extracts HTML but performs no sanitization.

    3. **`backend/main.py`**: (Previously analyzed and remains the same)  Includes CORS middleware but no sanitization middleware.

    4. **`backend/routes/generate_code.py`**: This file handles the WebSocket endpoint `/generate-code` for streaming code generation.
        ```python
        @router.websocket("/generate-code")
        async def stream_code(websocket: WebSocket):
            await websocket.accept()
            # ... parameter extraction and AI call ...
            completions = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True) # Calling AI models in parallel
            # ... error handling ...

            # Post-processing - Extract HTML content (no sanitization here)
            completions = [extract_html_content(completion) for completion in completions]

            # ... image generation ...

            for index, updated_html in enumerate(updated_completions):
                await send_message("setCode", updated_html, index) # Sending code to frontend via WebSocket
                await send_message("status", "Code generation complete.", index)
            # ... websocket close ...
        ```
        - The `stream_code` function is responsible for handling code generation requests via WebSocket.
        - After receiving the AI-generated `completions`, it calls `extract_html_content`. As previously analyzed, `extract_html_content` only extracts HTML using regex without any sanitization.
        - The `updated_html` (which is the output of `extract_html_content` and potentially contains malicious code) is directly sent to the frontend using `send_message("setCode", updated_html, index)`. There is no sanitization step before sending the code to the frontend.
        - The frontend, upon receiving the "setCode" message, is expected to render this HTML. If the frontend does not sanitize this HTML before rendering, XSS will occur.

    5. **`backend/routes/evals.py`**: This file is used for evaluating different code generation outputs. It retrieves HTML files from specified folders and sends them to the frontend as part of the evaluation data.
        ```python
        @router.get("/evals", response_model=list[Eval])
        async def get_evals(folder: str):
            # ... folder and file processing ...
            for base_name in base_names:
                # ... input image loading ...

                if output_file:
                    # ... input_data ...
                    with open(output_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                        output_html = f.read() # Reading HTML from file
                    evals.append(Eval(input=input_data, outputs=[output_html])) # Sending raw HTML in response
            return evals
        ```
        - The `get_evals` function reads HTML content directly from files (`output_html = f.read()`) and includes it in the API response under `outputs`.
        - This API response is likely consumed by the frontend to display the generated code for evaluation.
        - If these HTML files (located in the `folder` path, which seems to be configurable/accessible) are not properly created or sanitized before being placed there, they could contain malicious scripts. If the frontend renders the `output_html` without sanitization, it could also lead to XSS.
        - While the primary XSS vulnerability is in the AI-generated code flow, this `evals.py` route could present a secondary XSS risk if the HTML files used for evaluations are attacker-controlled or maliciously crafted and are displayed without sanitization in the frontend.

    6. **Overall Code Flow (Updated Visualization):**

    ```
    Frontend (User Input: Screenshot) --> Backend (WebSocket Endpoint /generate-code in generate_code.py)
                                        --> backend/llm.py (Call AI Model)
                                        <-- backend/llm.py (AI Generated Code - potentially malicious)
                                        --> backend/codegen/utils.py (Extract HTML - no sanitization)
                                        <-- backend/codegen/utils.py (Extracted HTML - still potentially malicious)
                                        --> WebSocket Send "setCode" with Potentially Malicious HTML --> Frontend
    Frontend (Receives "setCode" and Renders Potentially Malicious HTML) --> XSS Vulnerability (if malicious JavaScript exists in HTML)

    --- Potential Secondary XSS Vector ---
    Backend (API Endpoint /evals in evals.py) --> Reads HTML files from disk (potentially malicious if files are compromised)
                                             --> Backend Response (Potentially Malicious HTML in "outputs") --> Frontend
    Frontend (Receives /evals response and Renders Potentially Malicious HTML) --> XSS Vulnerability (if malicious JavaScript exists in HTML from eval files)
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Access the application**: Open the web application in a browser (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` if running locally).
    2. **Prepare a malicious screenshot**: Create a PNG image file (e.g., `xss_image.png`).  Create an image that visually looks like a button, but include the text `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` within the visual representation of the button.
    3. **Upload the malicious screenshot**: In the application's frontend, use the image upload functionality to upload `xss_image.png`.
    4. **Select Stack and Model**: Choose any supported stack (e.g., "HTML + Tailwind") and any AI model available in the application.
    5. **Generate Code**: Initiate the code generation process.
    6. **Observe the Output**: After the AI generates the code and the frontend renders the output, observe if an alert box appears in your browser. If an alert box with "XSS" appears, it confirms the XSS vulnerability.
    7. **Examine the Generated Code (Optional but recommended):** Inspect the HTML code generated by the AI in the frontend (e.g., using browser developer tools) after the alert. Look for the injected JavaScript payload (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`) in the rendered HTML to confirm that it originated from the AI-generated output and was rendered without sanitization.
