### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious screenshot containing UI elements that, when interpreted by the AI model, lead to the generation of JavaScript code with an XSS vulnerability. For example, the screenshot might visually represent an input field or text area that could be misinterpreted by the AI as a location to insert arbitrary JavaScript code.
    2. The user uploads this malicious screenshot to the application.
    3. The backend processes the screenshot using an AI model (e.g., Claude, GPT-4) to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The `backend/routes/generate_code.py` file handles the code generation process using a websocket connection. It receives user parameters and input via websocket, creates a prompt based on the input, and sends this prompt to the selected AI model using functions from `llm.py`.
    4. Due to the crafted nature of the screenshot and the AI model's interpretation, the generated JavaScript code unknowingly contains a malicious payload, such as `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` or code to redirect to a malicious website or steal user credentials.
    5. The backend, specifically the code in `backend/routes/generate_code.py` and `llm.py`, returns this generated code to the frontend without any sanitization or security checks. The `stream_code` function in `generate_code.py` streams chunks of code back to the client via websocket as it receives them from the AI model, and finally sends the complete generated code in a `setCode` message, without any intermediate sanitization.
    6. A user, unaware of the malicious code, downloads or copies and implements the generated code into their web application.
    7. When another user visits the web application with the implemented AI-generated code, the malicious JavaScript payload executes in their browser, leading to Cross-Site Scripting.

- Impact:
    * **High**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the user's application. This can lead to:
        * **Data theft**: Stealing session cookies, access tokens, personal information, and other sensitive data.
        * **Account takeover**: Performing actions on behalf of the user, potentially including changing passwords, making transactions, or accessing sensitive functionalities.
        * **Redirection to malicious sites**: Redirecting users to phishing websites or sites hosting malware.
        * **Defacement**: Altering the content and appearance of the web application.
        * **Further attacks**: Using the XSS vulnerability as a stepping stone for more complex attacks against the user or other users of the application.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None: Based on the provided code files, there are no explicit mitigations implemented to sanitize or validate the generated code from the AI models in the backend. The code generation process in `llm.py` focuses on interacting with the AI APIs and streaming the responses without any security considerations for the generated code itself. The `backend/routes/generate_code.py` file, which handles the websocket communication and orchestrates code generation, also lacks any sanitization logic before sending the generated code to the client. The `extract_html_content` function in `backend/routes/generate_code.py` is used for extracting HTML, not for sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
    * **Backend Output Sanitization**: Implement a robust HTML, CSS, and JavaScript sanitization library in the backend within `backend/routes/generate_code.py`. Before sending the generated code to the frontend via the websocket, this library should parse the AI-generated code and remove or neutralize any potentially malicious or unsafe code constructs (e.g., `<script>` tags, inline event handlers like `onload`, `onerror`, `javascript:` URLs, and potentially dangerous DOM manipulation functions).
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a strong Content Security Policy in the frontend application that serves the generated code. CSP can significantly reduce the risk of XSS by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, and by restricting inline JavaScript execution.
    * **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**: If external JavaScript libraries are included in the generated code (like CDNs for jQuery, Tailwind, etc.), use Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure that the browser only executes scripts if the fetched file's content matches a known, trusted hash. This prevents attackers from tampering with CDN files.
    * **Code Review and User Awareness**:  Provide clear warnings to users in the frontend application about the potential security risks of directly using AI-generated code without careful review and testing. Encourage users to treat AI-generated code as a starting point and to perform thorough security reviews before deployment.
    * **Backend Input Sanitization**: Although the input is an image, consider input validation on the image processing side to detect and reject potentially malicious image formats or embedded data as a defense-in-depth measure.

- Preconditions:
    * An attacker needs to craft a specific screenshot that can successfully induce the AI model to generate vulnerable JavaScript code. This might require some experimentation and understanding of how the AI model interprets different UI elements in screenshots.
    * A user must utilize the application to generate code from the malicious screenshot and then implement the generated, vulnerable code into a publicly accessible web application.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`backend/llm.py`**: This file contains the core logic for interacting with Language Model APIs. Functions like `stream_openai_response`, `stream_claude_response`, and `stream_gemini_response` send prompts to the AI models and receive generated code as responses.
    ```python
    async def stream_openai_response(
        messages: List[ChatCompletionMessageParam],
        api_key: str,
        base_url: str | None,
        callback: Callable[[str], Awaitable[None]],
        model: Llm,
    ) -> Completion:
        # ...
        stream = await client.chat.completions.create(**params)  # type: ignore
        full_response = ""
        async for chunk in stream:  # type: ignore
            # ...
            content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content or ""
            full_response += content
            await callback(content)
        # ...
        return {"duration": completion_time, "code": full_response}
    ```
    * **Vulnerability Point**: The `full_response` variable, accumulating AI-generated code, is returned directly without sanitization.

    2. **`backend/routes/generate_code.py`**: This file handles the websocket endpoint `/generate-code` and orchestrates the code generation process.
    ```python
    @router.websocket("/generate-code")
    async def stream_code(websocket: WebSocket):
        await websocket.accept()
        # ... parameter extraction, prompt creation ...
        async def process_chunk(content: str, variantIndex: int):
            await send_message("chunk", content, variantIndex)

        # ... model selection and code generation tasks ...
        completions = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
        # ... error handling ...

        completions = [
            result["code"]
            for result in completions
            if not isinstance(result, BaseException)
        ]

        # Post-processing - extract HTML content, but no sanitization
        completions = [extract_html_content(completion) for completion in completions]

        # ... image generation ...

        for index, updated_html in enumerate(updated_completions):
            await send_message("setCode", updated_html, index) # Send final code via websocket
            # ...
        await websocket.close()
    ```
    * **Vulnerability Point**: The `stream_code` function in `generate_code.py` receives the raw generated code from `llm.py`, performs post-processing using `extract_html_content` (which does not sanitize), and then directly sends this code to the frontend via the `setCode` websocket message. There is no HTML, CSS, or JavaScript sanitization implemented before sending the code to the client.
    * **No Sanitization**: Neither `llm.py` nor `generate_code.py` includes any code to sanitize the AI-generated output. The focus is on prompt creation, API interaction, and streaming responses, not on security of the generated code.
    * **Direct Use of AI Output**: The backend directly transmits the AI-generated code to the frontend without any security modifications, making the application vulnerable to XSS if the AI model is tricked into generating malicious JavaScript.

    3. **`frontend/src/components/CodeDisplay.js` (hypothetical, based on project description)**:  As described previously, the frontend likely receives and displays this unsanitized code, making the application vulnerable when users copy and use this code. Client-side sanitization, if any, would be insufficient as a robust security measure.

    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition**: Ensure you have access to a running instance of the `screenshot-to-code` application. You also need to be able to view the code generated by the application.
    2. **Craft Malicious Screenshot**: Create a screenshot that visually represents a simple UI element (e.g., a heading or a paragraph) but subtly includes an HTML injection attempt that could be interpreted as JavaScript code by the AI. For example, create an image of text that looks like a normal heading, but the text content in the image is actually: `<h1>This is a heading <script>alert('XSS-Test')</script></h1>`. Save this image as `xss_screenshot.png`.
    3. **Upload Screenshot**: In the `screenshot-to-code` application UI, upload the `xss_screenshot.png` as the input screenshot. Choose any stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind).
    4. **Generate Code**: Click the "Generate Code" button in the application.
    5. **Inspect Generated Code**: After the code generation process is complete, examine the generated HTML/JavaScript code displayed by the application. Look for the presence of the `<script>alert('XSS-Test')</script>` payload or any similar JavaScript code that could execute arbitrary scripts. If the AI model successfully interpreted the screenshot and included the malicious script in the generated output, proceed to the next step.
    6. **Deploy and Test**: Copy the generated HTML code. Create a new HTML file (e.g., `test_xss.html`) and paste the generated code into it. Open `test_xss.html` in a web browser.
    7. **Verify XSS**: Check if the JavaScript code within the generated code executes when the HTML file is loaded in the browser. In this case, you should see an alert box with "XSS-Test". If the alert box appears, it confirms that the XSS vulnerability is present in the AI-generated code and exploitable.

This test case demonstrates how a crafted screenshot can lead to the generation of code containing a client-side vulnerability (XSS) due to the lack of sanitization in the `screenshot-to-code` application.
