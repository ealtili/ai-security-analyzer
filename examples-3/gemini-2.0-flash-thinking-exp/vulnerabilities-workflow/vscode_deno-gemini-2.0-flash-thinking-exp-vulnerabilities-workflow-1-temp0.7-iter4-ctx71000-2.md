### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Code Injection via Malicious .env File
- Description:
    1. A threat actor crafts a malicious repository.
    2. Within this repository, the attacker creates a `.env` file containing specially crafted content designed to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the `dotenv.parse` library.
    3. A victim, with the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension installed, opens this malicious repository in VSCode.
    4. The extension, upon activation or when certain commands are executed (like running tests or starting the language server), reads the `deno.envFile` setting from the VSCode configuration. If this setting is configured to point to a `.env` file within the opened workspace (or defaults to a workspace-relative path, which is common), the extension attempts to load environment variables from this file.
    5. The extension uses `fs.readFileSync` to read the content of the `.env` file and then utilizes `dotenv.parse()` to parse this content into environment variables.
    6. If the malicious `.env` file is crafted to exploit a vulnerability in `dotenv.parse()` function, it could lead to code injection. This is because `dotenv.parse()` might, under certain conditions or with specific inputs, execute code or lead to unexpected behavior during the parsing process itself. While `dotenv` is generally considered safe for standard use cases, vulnerabilities can emerge, especially when parsing untrusted and potentially malicious input.
    7. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code within the context of the VSCode extension, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the victim's machine.

- Impact: Code Injection, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). If exploited, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine when they open a malicious repository in VSCode.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The current code directly reads and parses the `.env` file content using `dotenv.parse` without any input validation or sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of the `.env` file content before it is parsed by `dotenv.parse()`. This could involve checks for malicious patterns, excessively long strings, or unexpected characters that could trigger vulnerabilities in the parser.
    - Consider using a more secure or sandboxed environment for parsing `.env` files to limit the impact of potential code injection vulnerabilities.
    - Implement least privilege principles by restricting the operations that can be performed using environment variables loaded from `.env` files.
    - Conduct a thorough security audit of the `dotenv.parse()` library to identify any known or potential code injection vulnerabilities when handling untrusted input. Regularly update the `dotenv` library to patch any discovered vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions:
    - The victim must have the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension installed in VSCode.
    - The victim must open a malicious repository provided by the attacker in VSCode.
    - The `deno.envFile` setting must be configured to point to a `.env` file within the malicious repository, or it should rely on a default behavior that causes the extension to look for and parse a `.env` file in the workspace root (which the attacker can then provide).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability is located in the `client\src\commands.ts` file within the `startLanguageServer` and `test` functions, and in `client\src\upgrade.ts` within the `denoUpgradePromptAndExecute` function. The relevant code snippet, which is similar across these functions, is:

    ```typescript
    const denoEnvFile = config.get<string>("envFile");
    if (denoEnvFile) {
      if (workspaceFolder) {
        const denoEnvPath = path.join(workspaceFolder.uri.fsPath, denoEnvFile);
        try {
          const content = fs.readFileSync(denoEnvPath, { encoding: "utf8" });
          const parsed = dotenv.parse(content); // Potential Code Injection Vulnerability
          Object.assign(env, parsed);
        } catch (error) {
          vscode.window.showErrorMessage(
            `Could not read env file "${denoEnvPath}": ${error}`,
          );
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    - The line `const parsed = dotenv.parse(content);` is the point where the vulnerability could be triggered. The `content` variable, which holds the content of the `.env` file, comes directly from `fs.readFileSync` and is passed to `dotenv.parse()` without any sanitization. If `dotenv.parse()` is susceptible to code injection based on crafted input, this code would execute it.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a new directory to serve as a malicious repository, and initialize it as a Git repository (optional, but good practice for simulating real-world scenarios).
        - Inside this repository, create a file named `.env`.
        - Install the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension in VSCode if it is not already installed.
    2. **Craft Malicious .env Content:**
        - In the `.env` file, insert content that attempts to exploit a potential code injection vulnerability in `dotenv.parse()`. A simplified test payload could be to attempt environment variable manipulation or command execution if `dotenv.parse()` is vulnerable. For example, if variable expansion is processed insecurely:
        ```env
        MALICIOUS_VAR=$({malicious_command}) # Example of command injection if dotenv expands commands
        ```
        or to test for simple code injection, try to insert Javascript code if `dotenv.parse()` processes values in an unsafe manner (less likely but worth exploring if specific vulnerabilities are known for `dotenv`):
        ```env
        INJECTION_TEST='); process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('touch /tmp/pwned'); //
        ```
        *(Note: The above are examples. The actual payload would depend on specific vulnerabilities in `dotenv.parse()`. You may need to research known vulnerabilities or perform fuzzing to find effective payloads.)*
    3. **Open Malicious Repository in VSCode:**
        - Open the directory created in step 1 as a workspace in VSCode.
    4. **Configure `deno.envFile` (if necessary):**
        - Check your VSCode settings. If `deno.envFile` is not already set to `.env` or a default workspace-relative path, configure it to point to `.env` in your workspace settings (workspace settings, not user settings, to simulate attacker-controlled workspace). For example, in `.vscode/settings.json`:
        ```json
        {
            "deno.envFile": ".env"
        }
        ```
        - If the extension defaults to looking for `.env` in the workspace root without this setting, this step might not be necessary.
    5. **Trigger Extension Activity:**
        - To trigger the extension to load the `.env` file, you can perform actions like:
            - Open a `.ts` or `.js` file in the workspace to activate the Deno language server.
            - Execute a Deno command, such as using the "Deno: Cache" command from the command palette, or try to run a test using the "Run Test" code lens if you have a test file.
        - Monitor for any signs of code execution or unexpected behavior. For the `touch /tmp/pwned` example, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created after triggering the extension activity. For command injection, observe if the commands within `${}` are executed.
    6. **Observe and Verify:**
        - After performing the actions in step 5, carefully observe the system for any signs of malicious activity. Check for:
            - Execution of commands that should not be executed under normal operation.
            - Creation of unexpected files (like `/tmp/pwned` in the example).
            - Any other system-level changes indicating unauthorized access or execution.
        - Review VSCode's output channels (especially the Deno extension's output channel) for any error messages or unusual logs that might indicate an issue during `.env` file parsing.

    **Expected Result:** If a code injection vulnerability exists in `dotenv.parse()` and the crafted `.env` file successfully exploits it, you should observe the side effects of your malicious payload (e.g., file creation, command execution). If successful, this test case validates the Code Injection vulnerability. If no such behavior is observed with reasonable attempts, it might indicate that `dotenv.parse()` is not vulnerable in this specific way, or the payload is not effective, requiring further investigation into `dotenv`'s parsing behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
