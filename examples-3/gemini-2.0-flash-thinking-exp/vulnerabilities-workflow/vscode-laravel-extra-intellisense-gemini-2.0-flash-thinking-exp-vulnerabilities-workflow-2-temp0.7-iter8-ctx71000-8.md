### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Remote Code Execution via Malicious Laravel Project
- Description:
    1. A developer opens a malicious Laravel project in VS Code with the Laravel Extra Intellisense extension installed.
    2. The extension automatically starts gathering autocompletion data. To do this, it executes PHP code within the context of the opened Laravel project by bootstrapping the Laravel application.
    3. This PHP code execution involves running `vendor/autoload.php` and `bootstrap/app.php` of the opened project.
    4. A malicious Laravel project can be crafted to contain arbitrary PHP code within its service providers, configuration files, or other components that are executed during the Laravel bootstrapping process.
    5. When the extension bootstraps the malicious project, this malicious code gets executed on the developer's machine.
    6. If the developer's environment, as configured by the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting, is not properly sandboxed, the malicious code from the Laravel project can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). For example, if `phpCommand` is simply set to `php -r "{code}"`, any malicious PHP code embedded in the project can be executed with the privileges of the user running VS Code.
- Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can gain complete control over the developer's machine by crafting a malicious Laravel project. This can lead to data theft, installation of malware, or further exploitation of the developer's system and potentially their organization's network.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Security Note in `README.md`: The `README.md` file includes a "Security Note" that warns users about the extension running their Laravel application and suggests temporarily disabling the extension if they have sensitive code in service providers. This is a documentation-based mitigation, alerting users to the potential risk, but it does not technically prevent the vulnerability.
    - Location: `README.md` - Security Note section.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Sandboxing or Isolation: The extension lacks any sandboxing or isolation mechanisms for the PHP execution environment. It directly executes PHP code from the opened project within the user's environment. A secure approach would involve running the PHP code in a sandboxed environment (e.g., using Docker containers or similar technologies) to limit the impact of malicious code execution.
    - Input Sanitization: While the extension generates the PHP code itself, it does not sanitize the environment or project context in which this code is executed. Although current code analysis suggests the generated PHP is static, the execution context (the Laravel project) is not controlled and can be malicious.
    - Secure Default Configuration Guidance:  The extension could provide clearer guidance and recommendations on how to securely configure the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting, especially when working with untrusted Laravel projects. Suggesting or enforcing sandboxed execution environments by default would significantly reduce the risk.
    - Permissions Reduction: The extension could be designed to require minimal necessary permissions, reducing the potential damage from RCE. However, given the nature of VS Code extensions and the need to interact with the file system and execute processes, this might be of limited effectiveness for this specific type of vulnerability.
- Preconditions:
    1. The developer has the Laravel Extra Intellisense extension installed in VS Code.
    2. The developer opens a malicious Laravel project in VS Code.
    3. The `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` configuration is set to a command that allows for arbitrary code execution in the user's environment (e.g., the default `php -r "{code}"` or similar configurations without sandboxing).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `src/helpers.ts`: The `Helpers.runLaravel()` function is central to this vulnerability. It constructs a PHP script that bootstraps the Laravel application and then executes a provided code snippet using `Helpers.runPhp()`.
    - Within `Helpers.runLaravel()`, the lines:
        ```typescript
        "require_once '" + Helpers.projectPath("vendor/autoload.php", true) + "';" +
        "$app = require_once '" + Helpers.projectPath("bootstrap/app.php", true) + "';" +
        ```
        are responsible for bootstrapping the Laravel application of the opened project. These lines directly execute PHP code from the project's `vendor` and `bootstrap` directories.
    - `Helpers.runPhp()` then uses `child_process.exec()` to execute the constructed PHP command, including the bootstrapped Laravel environment and the code snippet for data extraction. The security of this execution entirely depends on the `phpCommand` configuration and the integrity of the Laravel project being opened.
    - The various provider files (`AssetProvider.ts`, `AuthProvider.ts`, `BladeProvider.ts`, etc.) all utilize `Helpers.runLaravel()` to fetch data required for autocompletion. This means that whenever these providers are active (which is essentially always when the extension is enabled and a Laravel project is opened), the bootstrapping process and potential malicious code execution can occur.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Ensure you have the Laravel Extra Intellisense extension installed in VS Code.
        - Create a new directory named `malicious-laravel-project`.
        - Inside `malicious-laravel-project`, create a standard Laravel project structure (you can use `laravel new malicious-laravel-project`, but a minimal structure is sufficient). You will need `vendor` and `bootstrap` directories, and a `composer.json` file to run `composer install`.
        - In `malicious-laravel-project/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`, within the `boot()` method, add the following malicious PHP code:
          ```php
          <?php

          namespace App\Providers;

          use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

          class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
          {
              /**
               * Register any application services.
               *
               * @return void
               */
              public function register()
              {
                  //
              }

              /**
               * Bootstrap any application services.
               *
               * @return void
               */
              public function boot()
              {
                  file_put_contents('/tmp/laravel_extra_intellisense_pwned.txt', 'Successfully pwned by Laravel Extra Intellisense extension.');
              }
          }
          ```
        - Run `composer install` inside `malicious-laravel-project` to set up dependencies.
    2. **Execution:**
        - Open VS Code.
        - Open the `malicious-laravel-project` directory as a workspace in VS Code (`File` > `Open Folder...` and select `malicious-laravel-project`).
        - Wait for the Laravel Extra Intellisense extension to activate and attempt to gather data (this usually happens automatically in the background).
    3. **Verification:**
        - Check if a file named `laravel_extra_intellisense_pwned.txt` has been created in the `/tmp/` directory of your system.
        - If the file exists and contains the string 'Successfully pwned by Laravel Extra Intellisense extension.', it confirms that the malicious code within `AppServiceProvider.php` of the opened Laravel project was executed by the extension, demonstrating Remote Code Execution.
