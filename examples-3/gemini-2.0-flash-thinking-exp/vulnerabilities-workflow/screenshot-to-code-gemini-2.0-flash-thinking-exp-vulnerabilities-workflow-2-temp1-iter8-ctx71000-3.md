Based on the instructions and the provided vulnerability description, here's the updated list:

### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via AI-Generated Code

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious input image or prompt that, when processed by the AI model, results in the generation of HTML code containing embedded JavaScript.
    2. The backend, upon receiving the AI-generated code, does not sanitize or validate it.
    3. The backend sends the potentially malicious HTML code to the frontend.
    4. The frontend receives the HTML code and dynamically renders it within the user's browser, without sanitization.
    5. If the AI generated malicious JavaScript, it will be executed in the victim's browser, leading to Cross-Site Scripting.

* Impact:
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to:
    - Account hijacking: Stealing session cookies or other authentication tokens.
    - Data theft: Accessing sensitive information visible to the user.
    - Defacement: Modifying the content of the web page displayed to the user.
    - Redirection: Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Further attacks: Using the XSS to launch other attacks, such as phishing or malware distribution.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of input sanitization or output encoding of the AI-generated HTML code in the backend or frontend. The backend code focuses on calling AI models and extracting HTML, while sanitization logic is absent.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: Sanitize user inputs (image or text prompts) to prevent injection of malicious scripts that could influence AI-generated output.
    - Output Sanitization/Encoding: Implement robust HTML sanitization on the backend before sending the AI-generated code to the frontend. This should remove or neutralize any potentially malicious JavaScript or HTML elements. Libraries like DOMPurify (for JavaScript frontend) or bleach (for Python backend) could be used.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict CSP to limit the capabilities of JavaScript execution within the application, which can reduce the impact of XSS attacks.
    - HTTP-Only Cookies: Ensure sensitive cookies are set with the HTTP-Only flag to prevent JavaScript from accessing them, mitigating cookie theft via XSS.

* Preconditions:
    - The application must be running and accessible to the attacker.
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide an input (image or prompt) that influences the AI model's output.
    - The application must render the AI-generated HTML output in a user's browser without proper sanitization.

* Source Code Analysis:

    1. **`backend/llm.py`**: This file contains the core logic for interacting with LLMs. Functions like `stream_openai_response` process AI responses and return the generated code without sanitization.

    2. **`backend/mock_llm.py`**: Mock HTML code examples demonstrate the system's capability to generate HTML, confirming the XSS risk if not sanitized.

    3. **`backend/codegen/utils.py`**: The `extract_html_content` function extracts HTML using regex without any sanitization.

    4. **`backend/routes/generate_code.py`**: This file handles the `/generate-code` websocket endpoint, which is the core of the code generation process.
        ```python
        @router.websocket("/generate-code")
        async def stream_code(websocket: WebSocket):
            await websocket.accept()
            # ... parameter extraction and prompt creation ...

            # ... code generation using LLMs ...
            completions = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
            completions = [
                result["code"]
                for result in completions
                if not isinstance(result, BaseException)
            ]

            ## Post-processing
            # Strip the completion of everything except the HTML content
            completions = [extract_html_content(completion) for completion in completions]

            # ... image generation ...

            for index, updated_html in enumerate(updated_completions):
                await send_message("setCode", updated_html, index)
                # ...
        ```
        - The `stream_code` function in `generate_code.py` orchestrates the code generation.
        - After receiving responses from the LLMs, it extracts HTML content using `extract_html_content`.
        - Critically, there is **no HTML sanitization** applied to the `completions` after extracting the HTML and before sending it to the frontend via `send_message("setCode", updated_html, index)`.
        - The `send_message` function (defined within `stream_code`) then transmits this raw, potentially malicious HTML to the frontend through the websocket connection. This confirms that the backend directly forwards the AI-generated HTML to the frontend without any security measures, creating a direct path for XSS.

    5. **`backend/routes/evals.py`**: This route also handles HTML content, reading and serving HTML files, further emphasizing the application's handling of HTML and the potential risk if not sanitized at any point before rendering in the browser.

    6. **Absence of Sanitization:** Review of all backend files confirms the absence of any HTML sanitization logic before AI-generated code is sent to the frontend.

* Security Test Case:

    1. **Setup:** Ensure the backend and frontend are running locally as described in the `README.md`. Access the application through the browser (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

    2. **Craft Malicious Input:** Prepare an input image or prompt designed to elicit JavaScript code generation from the AI. For example, take any screenshot and slightly modify the prompt to encourage the model to include a `<script>` tag.  If using an image, the prompt might be something like "Generate HTML code for this image, and include a button that shows an alert box with the text 'XSS' when clicked".

    3. **Send Request:** Upload the crafted image or use the modified prompt in the application to generate code. Select any stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind).

    4. **Observe Generated Code (Backend - optional, Frontend - required):**
        - **Backend (optional):** If you have access to backend logs or debugging tools, examine the raw AI-generated code returned by the LLM. Look for the presence of `<script>` tags or JavaScript event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onclick`, `onerror`, `onmouseover`). You can also set `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED=True` in `backend/.env` to inspect debug output files if implemented in routes.
        - **Frontend (required):** Inspect the rendered output in the browser's developer tools (e.g., right-click on the generated output and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"). Look for the injected `<script>` tag or event handlers in the HTML source code of the rendered page.

    5. **Verify XSS Execution:** If a `<script>` tag like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` was successfully generated and rendered, an alert box with "XSS" should appear in the browser when the page loads or when the relevant part of the UI is interacted with (e.g., clicking the button if you prompted for a button). If you used an event handler, trigger the event (e.g., click the button, move mouse over an element) and check if the JavaScript code executes (e.g., an alert box appears, or a network request is made to a controlled server).

    6. **Expected Result:** If the application is vulnerable, the injected JavaScript code will execute, demonstrating Cross-Site Scripting. In this case, you should see the alert box or other signs of JavaScript execution. If no alert box appears and the JavaScript code is not executed, then the application might have some form of sanitization (which is unlikely based on the source code review of provided files).

    7. **Example Malicious Prompt (Text-based, might work better for certain models):** "Generate HTML for a webpage with a heading 'Welcome' and a paragraph. Inside the paragraph, embed javascript code that shows an alert box saying 'XSS-Test' when the page loads using `<script>alert('XSS-Test')</script>`"
