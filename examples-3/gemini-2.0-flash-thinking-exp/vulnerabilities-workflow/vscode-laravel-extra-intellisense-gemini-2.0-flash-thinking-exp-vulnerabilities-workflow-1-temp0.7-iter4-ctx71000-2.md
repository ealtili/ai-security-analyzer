### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in `phpCommand` setting
- Description:
    1. A victim opens a workspace containing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file, or a malicious actor modifies the victim's user settings for the workspace.
    2. The malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file or modified user settings includes a crafted value for the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting. This crafted value injects arbitrary commands alongside the expected PHP execution. For example, it could be set to `php -r "{code}" && malicious_command`.
    3. The VSCode extension, when activated in the workspace, periodically executes PHP code to provide autocompletion features. This execution is performed using the `Helpers.runPhp()` function.
    4. `Helpers.runPhp()` retrieves the `phpCommand` from the workspace configuration without sanitization.
    5. The extension substitutes `{code}` in the `phpCommand` with the necessary PHP code for Laravel interaction.
    6. Because of the injected commands in the `phpCommand` setting, when `child_process.exec()` is called in `Helpers.runPhp()`, both the intended PHP code and the attacker's injected commands are executed by the system shell.
- Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This could lead to complete compromise of the victim's local machine, including data theft, malware installation, or further lateral movement within a network if the victim's machine is connected to one.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The extension explicitly warns about security implications in the README, but this is not a technical mitigation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for the `phpCommand` setting. The extension should validate or sanitize the `phpCommand` setting to prevent command injection.  Ideally, the extension should not allow arbitrary commands to be part of the `phpCommand`. A safer approach would be to only allow modification of the PHP binary path, and strictly control the arguments passed to it.
    - Restrict modification of the `phpCommand` setting to only trusted users or through secure configuration mechanisms.
    - Display a warning to the user if the `phpCommand` setting is modified from the default, highlighting the security risks.
- Preconditions:
    - The victim has the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension installed in VSCode.
    - The victim opens a workspace that contains a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file, or the attacker has already compromised the victim's user settings for the workspace.
    - The workspace must be a Laravel project for the extension to activate and attempt to run PHP commands.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `src/helpers.ts`:
        ```typescript
        static async runPhp(code: string, description: string|null = null) : Promise<string> {
            code = code.replace(/\"/g, "\\\"");
            if (['linux', 'openbsd', 'sunos', 'darwin'].some(unixPlatforms => os.platform().includes(unixPlatforms))) {
                code = code.replace(/\$/g, "\\$");
                code = code.replace(/\\\\'/g, '\\\\\\\\\'');
                code = code.replace(/\\\\"/g, '\\\\\\\\\"');
            }
            let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\""; // Vulnerable line: Retrieves phpCommand from configuration
            let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code); // Vulnerable line: Substitutes {code} without sanitizing phpCommand
            let out = new Promise<string>(function (resolve, error) {
                if (description != null) {
                    Helpers.outputChannel?.info("Laravel Extra Intellisense command started: " + description);
                }

                cp.exec(command, // Vulnerable line: Executes command using child_process.exec
                    { cwd: vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders && vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders.length > 0 ? vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0].uri.fsPath : undefined },
                    function (err, stdout, stderr) {
                        if (err == null) {
                            if (description != null) {
                                Helpers.outputChannel?.info("Laravel Extra Intellisense Resolved: " + description);
                            }
                            resolve(stdout);
                        } else {
                            const errorOutput = stderr.length > 0 ? stderr : stdout;
                            Helpers.outputChannel?.error("Laravel Extra Intellisense Error:\n " + (description ?? '') + '\n\n' + errorOutput);
                            Helpers.showErrorPopup();
                            error(errorOutput);
                        }
                    }
                );
            });
            return out;
        }
        ```
        The `runPhp` function in `src/helpers.ts` retrieves the `phpCommand` setting directly from the workspace configuration using `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand')`. It then uses string replacement to insert the PHP code into this command and executes it using `cp.exec()`. There is no sanitization or validation of the `phpCommand` itself, allowing for command injection if a malicious user modifies this setting.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new directory named `laravel-vuln-test`.
    2. Inside `laravel-vuln-test`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content. This configuration will modify the `phpCommand` to execute `touch /tmp/vscode-laravel-rce` before running the PHP code.

        ```json
        {
            "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}\" && touch /tmp/vscode-laravel-rce"
        }
        ```
    4. Open VSCode and open the `laravel-vuln-test` directory as a workspace.
    5. Create an empty file named `artisan` in the `laravel-vuln-test` directory to simulate a Laravel project root. This will trick the extension into activating.

        ```bash
        touch artisan
        ```
    6. Open any PHP file within the workspace (e.g., create `test.php` with `<?php`). This action triggers the extension to run PHP code, thus invoking the malicious `phpCommand`.
    7. Check if the file `/tmp/vscode-laravel-rce` has been created.

        ```bash
        ls -l /tmp/vscode-laravel-rce
        ```
        If the file exists, it confirms that the injected command `touch /tmp/vscode-laravel-rce` was executed, demonstrating command injection and RCE.

This test case assumes a Linux-like environment where `touch` and `/tmp` are available. For Windows, the `phpCommand` and injected command would need to be adjusted (e.g., `cmd /c "php -r \"{code}\" & echo vulnerable > C:\vscode-laravel-rce.txt"` and check for `C:\vscode-laravel-rce.txt`).
