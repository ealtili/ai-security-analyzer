### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AI-Generated Code Display

- Description:
  The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The AI models generate frontend code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) based on user-provided screenshots or screen recordings. This generated code is then displayed to the user in the frontend, presumably to showcase the conversion result and allow users to use or further edit the code. If the application fails to sanitize this AI-generated code before rendering it in the user's browser, a malicious actor could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the AI-generated output. When another user, or even the attacker themselves, views this output, the malicious JavaScript code will be executed in their browser, within the context of the application's origin.

  Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker crafts a visual design (screenshot, mockup, Figma design or screen recording) that, when processed by the AI, will result in the generation of frontend code containing malicious JavaScript. For example, the attacker could try to inject HTML attributes like `onload="malicious_js_code()"`, or directly embed `<script>malicious_js_code()</script>` tags within the design in a way that the AI model interprets them as part of the desired code structure.
    2. The attacker uses the application's functionality to convert this malicious design into frontend code using one of the AI models (Claude Sonnet 3.7, GPT-4o, etc.).
    3. The AI model, unaware of the malicious intent, generates code that includes the injected JavaScript.
    4. The application backend transmits this AI-generated code to the frontend.
    5. The frontend, without proper sanitization, renders the received AI-generated code in the user's browser.
    6. When a user views the generated code in the frontend, the malicious JavaScript code embedded within it gets executed.

- Impact:
  Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability can have severe consequences:
    * **Account Hijacking**: An attacker could steal session cookies or other authentication tokens, leading to account takeover.
    * **Data Theft**: Sensitive user data accessible by the application could be exfiltrated to a malicious server.
    * **Malware Distribution**: The attacker could redirect users to websites hosting malware or trick them into downloading malicious files.
    * **Website Defacement**: The attacker could alter the visual appearance of the web page, displaying misleading or harmful content.
    * **Redirection to Phishing Sites**: Users could be redirected to fake login pages designed to steal credentials.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Although DoS itself is excluded, as a secondary impact, malicious JavaScript could cause the user's browser to freeze or crash, effectively denying them access to the application's functionality temporarily on the client side.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  Based on the provided project files, including `backend/routes/evals.py`, `backend/routes/generate_code.py`, `backend/routes/home.py`, `backend/routes/screenshot.py`, `backend/video/utils.py`, and `backend/ws/constants.py`, there are **no explicit mitigations** implemented to sanitize the AI-generated code before displaying it in the frontend. The code generation process in `backend/routes/generate_code.py` focuses on interacting with AI models and streaming code to the frontend via WebSockets. While the code includes functions for extracting HTML content (e.g., `extract_html_content`), these are for extraction purposes and not for sanitization.  There is no evidence of HTML sanitization libraries or functions being used in the backend code before sending the generated code to the frontend. The focus remains on functionality and evaluation of AI models, without security hardening of the generated output.

- Missing Mitigations:
    * **HTML Sanitization on the Frontend**: The most crucial missing mitigation is a robust HTML sanitization library implemented in the frontend. Before rendering the AI-generated code, the application should use a library like DOMPurify or equivalent in React to parse the HTML and remove or neutralize any potentially malicious JavaScript code, such as `<script>` tags, `onload` attributes, and other event handlers that can execute JavaScript.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) would be a strong additional layer of defense. A properly configured CSP can prevent the execution of inline JavaScript and restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, significantly reducing the impact of XSS attacks.
    * **Backend Sanitization (Optional but Recommended)**: While frontend sanitization is essential, performing sanitization on the backend as well can provide defense in depth. The backend could pre-process the AI-generated code to remove obvious threats before sending it to the frontend. However, backend sanitization alone is not sufficient as frontend rendering context is critical for effective XSS prevention.

- Preconditions:
    * The attacker needs to be able to provide input (screenshot, mockup, Figma design or screen recording) to the application.
    * The application must successfully process this input using an AI model and generate frontend code that includes the attacker's malicious JavaScript.
    * The frontend must render this generated code in a user's browser without proper sanitization.
    * A user must view the page where the unsanitized AI-generated code is displayed.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Code Generation**: The file `backend/routes/generate_code.py` manages the code generation process. It uses AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) to generate code based on user input. The code interacts with these models through functions in `llm.py` and `mock_llm.py` (for testing).
    2. **WebSocket Communication**: `backend/routes/generate_code.py` uses a WebSocket (`/generate-code`) to stream code chunks to the frontend as they are generated. The final generated code is sent via WebSocket message with type `setCode`.
    3. **No Backend Sanitization**:  Review of `backend/routes/generate_code.py` and related backend files (`llm.py`, `codegen/*`, etc.) confirms the **absence of any HTML sanitization logic** before sending the generated code to the frontend. The function `extract_html_content` in `codegen/utils.py`, used in `backend/routes/generate_code.py`, is for extracting HTML content, not sanitizing it. The code primarily focuses on prompt creation, AI model interaction, and streaming the output.
    4. **Frontend Rendering (Assumed Unsafe)**: Based on the project description and the nature of React applications, it is highly likely that the frontend directly renders the HTML code received from the backend. Without explicit frontend code, this remains an assumption, but it is a standard practice to render received HTML dynamically in web applications, and if not explicitly sanitized, it leads to XSS vulnerabilities.
    5. **Vulnerability Confirmation**: The lack of sanitization in the backend, combined with the expected frontend rendering of AI-generated HTML, strongly indicates a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript through crafted input that is then generated as part of the HTML code by the AI models and executed in the user's browser when rendered by the frontend.

    **Visualization of Vulnerability Flow:**

    ```
    [Attacker Input (Malicious Design)] --> [Frontend] --> [Backend API Endpoint (/generate-code)] --> [AI Model (Generates Malicious Code)] --> [Backend] --> [WebSocket Stream to Frontend] --> [Frontend (Renders Unsanitized Code)] --> [User Browser (XSS Exploited)]
    ```

- Security Test Case:
  **Test Case Title:** XSS Vulnerability in AI-Generated HTML Code - Basic Script Injection

  **Description:** This test case verifies if it's possible to inject and execute JavaScript code through the AI-generated HTML output.

  **Preconditions:**
    * Access to a publicly available instance of the screenshot-to-code application.
    * Ability to upload or provide a screenshot or screen recording to the application.

  **Steps:**
    1. **Prepare a Malicious Screenshot:** Create a simple image (e.g., using any image editing tool or even a basic drawing application). Within this image, visually include text that, when interpreted by the AI and converted to HTML, will result in the injection of a JavaScript `alert()` command. For example, in the image, visually represent HTML structure that could be interpreted as: `<div id="xss-test" onload="alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected!')">Test</div>`.  Alternatively, try to visually represent: `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected!')</script><div>Test</div>` in the screenshot. The key is to make the visual representation such that the AI model generates code *containing* the malicious script.
    2. **Upload/Provide the Screenshot:** Use the application's frontend to upload or provide the crafted malicious screenshot. Select any supported stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind).
    3. **Generate Code:** Initiate the code generation process.
    4. **Inspect Generated Code Output in Frontend:** After the AI generates the code and it's displayed in the frontend, carefully inspect the rendered output (e.g., using browser's developer tools - Inspect Element). Look for the injected JavaScript code (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected!')</script>` or `onload="alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected!')"`).
    5. **Verify XSS Execution:** If the JavaScript code is present in the rendered HTML and executes (e.g., an alert box pops up with "XSS Vulnerability Detected!"), then the XSS vulnerability is confirmed.

  **Expected Result:** An alert box should pop up in the browser displaying "XSS Vulnerability Detected!", demonstrating successful execution of injected JavaScript code.

  **Success/Failure:** If the alert box appears, the test case is considered **successful**, indicating the presence of the XSS vulnerability. If no alert box appears and the injected script is either not present or not executed, the test case is considered **failed** (though further investigation may be needed to ensure proper testing and rule out other forms of XSS).
