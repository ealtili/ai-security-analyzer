### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Deno Tasks in `deno.json`/`deno.jsonc`
- Description:
    1. A threat actor crafts a malicious repository containing a `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` file.
    2. Within this configuration file, the threat actor defines a task with a malicious command. For example, a task could be configured to execute arbitrary shell commands like `rm -rf /` or similar.
    3. A victim user opens this malicious repository in Visual Studio Code with the "Deno for VSCode" extension enabled.
    4. The extension's Deno Tasks sidebar automatically fetches task definitions from the Deno Language Server, which parses and provides tasks from the `deno.json`/`deno.jsonc` file in the opened repository.
    5. The malicious task, now listed in the Deno Tasks sidebar, appears benignly named but contains the attacker's injected command.
    6. If the victim, unaware of the malicious intent, executes this task from the Deno Tasks sidebar (by clicking 'Run Task' or similar action), the `vscode.tasks.executeTask` function in the extension directly executes the command string defined in the malicious task definition.
    7. This results in the execution of the attacker's arbitrary commands within the victim's system shell, inheriting the privileges of the VS Code process.
- Impact:
    Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the same privileges as the VS Code process. This can lead to complete compromise of the victim's local system, including data theft, malware installation, and further propagation of attacks.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The extension currently trusts task definitions provided by the Deno Language Server without additional validation or sanitization on the client side.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization: The Deno Language Server should sanitize task names and command strings from `deno.json`/`deno.jsonc` before providing them to the extension. Implement a strict validation policy, potentially using a whitelist of allowed commands or escaping potentially harmful characters.
    - User confirmation for task execution: Before executing any task defined in `deno.json`/`deno.jsonc` (especially for tasks originating from workspace configuration), the extension should prompt the user for explicit confirmation. This prompt should clearly display the command to be executed and warn users about potential security risks, especially when working with untrusted repositories.
    - Sandboxing or command execution isolation: Explore the feasibility of executing Deno tasks in a sandboxed or isolated environment to restrict the damage from potentially malicious commands. This might involve using secure execution contexts or containerization, although it could add complexity.
- Preconditions:
    1. The victim must have the "Deno for VSCode" extension installed and enabled in VS Code.
    2. The victim must open a workspace or folder in VS Code that contains a malicious `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` file crafted by the attacker.
    3. The malicious `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` file must define at least one task with a command containing malicious shell instructions.
    4. The victim must interact with the Deno Tasks sidebar and explicitly execute the malicious task, either intentionally or inadvertently.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. In `client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts`, the `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider.provideTasks` method retrieves task definitions by sending a `deno/taskDefinitions` request to the Deno Language Server:
    ```typescript
    async provideTasks(): Promise<Task[]> {
        // ...
        const configTasks = await client.sendRequest(taskReq);
        // ...
    }
    ```
    2. The `buildDenoConfigTask` function in `client\src\tasks.ts` constructs a `vscode.Task` object. Critically, it uses the `command` property from the task definition directly in the `ProcessExecution`:
    ```typescript
    export function buildDenoConfigTask(
      scope: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
      process: string,
      name: string,
      command: string | undefined, // <-- User-controlled command string
      sourceUri?: vscode.Uri,
    ): vscode.Task {
        // ...
        const task = new vscode.Task(
            {
              type: TASK_TYPE,
              name: name,
              command: "task",
              args,
              sourceUri,
            },
            scope,
            name,
            TASK_SOURCE,
            new vscode.ProcessExecution(process, ["task", ...args]), // <-- ProcessExecution with args
            ["$deno"],
        );
        task.detail = `$ ${command}`;
        return task;
    }
    ```
    3. When a user executes a task from the sidebar, `DenoTasksTreeDataProvider.#runTask` simply calls `tasks.executeTask(task.task)`:
    ```typescript
    #runTask(task: DenoTask) {
        tasks.executeTask(task.task); // <-- Executes the task, including the command from deno.json
    }
    ```
    4. The `vscode.tasks.executeTask` API then directly executes the `ProcessExecution` defined in the task, which contains the potentially malicious command string from `deno.json`/`deno.jsonc`. There is no sanitization or user confirmation step before executing these commands.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new directory to serve as a malicious repository, e.g., `malicious-repo`.
    2. Inside `malicious-repo`, create a file named `deno.json` with the following content:
    ```json
    {
      "tasks": {
        "evilTask": "echo 'PWNED' > /tmp/pwned.txt"
      }
    }
    ```
       (Note: For Windows, use `echo PWNED > %TEMP%\\pwned.txt`)
    3. Open VS Code and open the `malicious-repo` folder. Ensure the "Deno for VSCode" extension is active.
    4. In VS Code, navigate to the "Explorer" view and right-click on the workspace folder name, then select "Deno Tasks". This should open the Deno Tasks sidebar.
    5. In the Deno Tasks sidebar, you should see a task named "evilTask". Click the "Run Task" icon (play button) next to "evilTask".
    6. After the task execution completes (you might see a terminal window briefly appear), check for the file `/tmp/pwned.txt` (or `%TEMP%\\pwned.txt` on Windows).
    7. If the file `pwned.txt` exists and contains the text "PWNED", the command injection vulnerability is confirmed. The arbitrary command defined in `deno.json` was successfully executed.
