## Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Code Formatting
  **Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious code file that, when formatted using the Deno extension's formatting feature within VS Code, exploits a potential vulnerability in the extension's code handling, leading to arbitrary code execution within the user's VS Code environment.
  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the user's VS Code environment. This could allow an attacker to steal sensitive data, install malware, or compromise the user's system.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None mentioned in the description.
  **Missing Mitigations:** Input validation and sanitization of code content before formatting. Secure code handling practices within the extension to prevent code execution vulnerabilities during formatting.
  **Preconditions:**
    1. A user has the Deno extension installed in Visual Studio Code.
    2. An attacker provides or tricks the user into opening a malicious code file.
    3. The user attempts to format the malicious code file using the Deno extension's formatting feature within VS Code.
  **Source Code Analysis:** Not provided in the description. The description mentions a "potential vulnerability in the extension's code handling".  Further source code analysis of the Deno extension's formatting functionality would be required to pinpoint the exact location and nature of this potential vulnerability.
  **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a malicious code file (e.g., `malicious.ts`) containing code designed to trigger arbitrary code execution if a vulnerability exists during formatting. This code could attempt to execute a simple command like `console.log("Vulnerable")` or something more harmful for testing purposes in a controlled environment.
    2. Open the `malicious.ts` file in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension enabled.
    3. Use the Deno extension's formatting command (e.g., "Format Document" or auto-formatting on save).
    4. Observe if the malicious code is executed within the VS Code environment. Successful execution would indicate the presence of the arbitrary code execution vulnerability.
