### Vulnerability List:

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Deno Path Setting

    *   **Description:**
        1.  The VSCode Deno extension allows users to configure the path to the Deno executable using the `deno.path` setting.
        2.  This setting is used to spawn Deno CLI processes for various features like language server, testing, and tasks.
        3.  If a malicious user can control the `deno.path` setting, they can inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the extension when it tries to spawn the Deno CLI.
        4.  This can be achieved by crafting a malicious workspace configuration (`.vscode/settings.json`) within a repository that, when opened by a victim, sets `deno.path` to a malicious executable path containing injected commands.
        5.  When the extension attempts to use the Deno CLI (e.g., when activating the extension or running a Deno command), the injected commands within the malicious path will be executed.

    *   **Impact:**
        Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This could lead to complete compromise of the victim's system, including data theft, malware installation, and further attacks.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

    *   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        None. The extension directly uses the user-provided `deno.path` setting to execute commands without sanitization or validation.

    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Input sanitization and validation for the `deno.path` setting.
        *   Restrict execution of the Deno CLI to a known safe path or directory.
        *   Display a warning message to the user when the `deno.path` setting is modified, especially in workspace settings, prompting for confirmation.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        1.  Victim has the VSCode Deno extension installed.
        2.  Victim opens a malicious repository in VSCode that contains a `.vscode/settings.json` file.
        3.  The malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file configures the `deno.path` setting to a malicious path containing injected commands.
        4.  The extension attempts to execute the Deno CLI, which can happen on extension activation, running Deno commands, or using features that rely on the CLI.

    *   **Source Code Analysis:**
        1.  **`client/src/util.ts` - `getDenoCommandPath()` function:**
            ```typescript
            export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
              const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath(); // [1] Get path from config
              const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
              if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
                return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
              } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
                // if sent a relative path, iterate over workspace folders to try and resolve.
                for (const workspace of workspaceFolders) {
                  const commandPath = path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command);
                  if (await fileExists(commandPath)) {
                    return commandPath;
                  }
                }
                return undefined;
              } else {
                return command; // [2] Return path from config directly
              }
            }

            function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
              const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)
                .get<string>("path"); // [3] Read 'deno.path' setting
              // ...
              return exePath;
            }
            ```
            The `getDenoCommandPath` function retrieves the Deno executable path from the `deno.path` configuration setting without any validation. It directly returns the user-provided path if it's absolute, or tries to resolve it within workspace folders if relative.

        2.  **`client/src/commands.ts` - `startLanguageServer()` function:**
            ```typescript
            export function startLanguageServer(
              context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
              extensionContext: DenoExtensionContext,
            ): Callback {
              return async () => {
                // ...
                const command = await getDenoCommandPath(); // [4] Get Deno path
                if (command == null) {
                  // ... error handling ...
                  return;
                }

                const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
                  run: {
                    command, // [5] Use the path to run LSP
                    args: ["lsp"],
                    options: { env },
                  },
                  debug: {
                    command, // [6] Use the path to debug LSP
                    args: ["lsp"],
                    options: { env },
                  },
                };
                const client = new LanguageClient(
                  // ...
                  serverOptions,
                  // ...
                );
                // ... client start ...
              };
            }
            ```
            The `startLanguageServer` function uses `getDenoCommandPath` to get the Deno executable path and then uses it directly in `ServerOptions.run.command` and `ServerOptions.debug.command` to spawn the language server process. This command is executed without any sanitization.

        3. **Other Command Execution Locations:** The `deno.path` obtained from `getDenoCommandPath()` is also used in other parts of the extension that execute Deno commands, such as task execution (`client/src/tasks.ts`), test execution (`client/src/commands.ts`, `client/src/testing.ts`), and upgrade command (`client/src/upgrade.ts`), making them all potential exploitation points.

        **Visualization:**

        ```mermaid
        graph LR
            A[VSCode Extension Activation/Command Execution] --> B{getDenoCommandPath()};
            B --> C{getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()};
            C --> D[Read 'deno.path' Setting from Workspace Config];
            D --> E{Return user-provided 'deno.path'};
            B --> F{Return default Deno path if no config};
            E --> G[Spawn Deno CLI process using user-provided path];
            F --> H[Spawn Deno CLI process using default path];
            G --> I[Malicious code execution if 'deno.path' is compromised];
        ```

    *   **Security Test Case:**
        1.  **Setup:**
            *   Create a new directory named `malicious-repo`.
            *   Inside `malicious-repo`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
            *   Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
                ```json
                {
                    "deno.enable": true,
                    "deno.path": "./malicious-deno.bat"
                }
                ```
            *   In `malicious-repo`, create a file named `malicious-deno.bat` (for Windows) or `malicious-deno.sh` (for Linux/macOS) with the following content.
                *   For Windows (`malicious-deno.bat`):
                    ```bat
                    @echo off
                    echo Vulnerability Triggered! > triggered.txt
                    echo Malicious command executed.
                    exit /b 0
                    ```
                *   For Linux/macOS (`malicious-deno.sh`):
                    ```sh
                    #!/bin/bash
                    echo "Vulnerability Triggered!" > triggered.txt
                    echo "Malicious command executed."
                    exit 0
                    ```
            *   Make `malicious-deno.bat` or `malicious-deno.sh` executable (`chmod +x malicious-deno.sh` on Linux/macOS).
            *   Create a simple Deno file, e.g., `main.ts` in `malicious-repo`:
                ```typescript
                console.log("Hello Deno!");
                ```

        2.  **Execution:**
            *   Open VSCode.
            *   Open the `malicious-repo` folder in VSCode (`File -> Open Folder...`).
            *   Ensure the Deno extension is activated (it should activate automatically due to `"deno.enable": true` in `settings.json`).
            *   Check if a file named `triggered.txt` has been created in the `malicious-repo` directory.

        3.  **Verification:**
            *   If `triggered.txt` exists and contains "Vulnerability Triggered!", it indicates that the malicious script (`malicious-deno.bat` or `malicious-deno.sh`) was executed because the extension used the user-provided `deno.path` without proper validation, leading to command injection.
