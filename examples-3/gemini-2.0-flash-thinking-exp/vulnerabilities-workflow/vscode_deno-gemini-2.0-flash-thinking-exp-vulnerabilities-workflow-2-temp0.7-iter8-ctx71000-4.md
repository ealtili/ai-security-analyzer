- Vulnerability name: Malicious Deno Executable Path Configuration
 - Description:
  - Step 1: An attacker crafts a malicious executable file, potentially named `deno` or a similar plausible name, and places it in a location they control. This executable can contain arbitrary malicious code.
  - Step 2: The attacker creates a project or modifies an existing one to include a `.vscode/settings.json` file.
  - Step 3: In the `.vscode/settings.json` file, the attacker sets the `deno.path` configuration to point to the malicious executable created in Step 1. This path could be relative or absolute, depending on the attacker's strategy. For example:
 ```json
 {
  "deno.path": "/path/to/malicious/deno"
 }
 ```
  - Step 4: The attacker distributes this malicious project, for example, by hosting it on a public repository, sending it via email, or through other means of social engineering.
  - Step 5: A victim user, who has the Deno VS Code extension installed and enabled, opens the malicious project in VS Code.
  - Step 6: When the Deno extension initializes or attempts to use Deno functionalities (like type checking, linting, formatting, testing, etc.), it reads the `deno.path` configuration from the workspace settings.
  - Step 7: Instead of executing the legitimate Deno CLI, the extension executes the malicious executable specified in `deno.path`.
  - Step 8: The malicious code within the executable is executed with the privileges of the user running VS Code, potentially compromising their system and data.
 - Impact:
  - Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
  - Full control over the user's environment within the permissions of the user running VS Code.
  - Potential data theft, malware installation, or further system compromise.
 - Vulnerability rank: Critical
 - Currently implemented mitigations:
  - None. The code does not implement any specific mitigations against this vulnerability. The extension relies on the user to provide a valid and safe path to the Deno executable.
 - Missing mitigations:
  - Input validation for `deno.path`: The extension should validate the `deno.path` setting to ensure it points to a legitimate Deno executable. This could include:
   - Checking if the file exists at the specified path.
   - Verifying the file extension (e.g., `.exe` on Windows, no extension on Linux/macOS) to match expected executable formats.
   - Validating the location of the executable to be within expected installation directories for Deno, or standard system executable paths.
   - Implementing a more robust verification mechanism, such as checking the digital signature of the executable, although this might be complex to implement cross-platform.
  - User warning for non-standard `deno.path`: If the `deno.path` is configured to a non-standard location (outside of typical installation directories or system paths), the extension should display a prominent warning to the user, highlighting the security risks and advising caution.
 - Preconditions:
  - The victim user has the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension installed and activated in VS Code.
  - The victim user opens a workspace that contains a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file, or is tricked into manually setting the `deno.path` configuration to a malicious executable.
 - Source code analysis:
  - In `client/src/util.ts`, the `getDenoCommandPath()` function is responsible for resolving the path to the Deno executable.
  - The function `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` retrieves the value of the `deno.path` setting from the VS Code configuration.
  - ```typescript
  function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
   const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)
    .get<string>("path");
   if (typeof exePath === "string" && exePath.trim().length === 0) {
    return undefined;
   } else {
    return exePath;
   }
  }
  ```
  - The code directly uses the string value from the configuration without any sanitization or validation.
  - If `deno.path` is configured, `getDenoCommandPath()` returns this value after attempting to resolve relative paths against workspace folders if the path is not absolute.
  - If `deno.path` is not configured or invalid, the function falls back to `getDefaultDenoCommand()` which searches for "deno" in the system's PATH and default installation directories. However, if a malicious `deno.path` is configured, this fallback mechanism is bypassed, and the malicious path is used.
 - Security test case:
  - Step 1: Create a malicious executable file (e.g., `malicious_deno.sh` on Linux/macOS or `malicious_deno.bat` on Windows). This script should simply demonstrate code execution, for example, by creating a file in the user's temporary directory or displaying a popup message.
   - Example `malicious_deno.sh` (Linux/macOS):
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Malicious Deno Executable Executed!" > /tmp/deno_attack.txt
   ```
   - Example `malicious_deno.bat` (Windows):
   ```batch
   @echo off
   echo Malicious Deno Executable Executed! > %TEMP%\deno_attack.txt
   ```
  - Step 2: Make the malicious script executable (`chmod +x malicious_deno.sh`).
  - Step 3: Create a new VS Code project.
  - Step 4: Inside the project, create a `.vscode` folder and within it, a `settings.json` file.
  - Step 5: In `settings.json`, set the `deno.path` to the absolute path of the malicious executable created in Step 1. For example:
   ```json
   {
    "deno.path": "/path/to/your/malicious_deno.sh"
   }
   ```
   - Step 6: Open VS Code and open the project created in Step 3. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace (you might need to run "Deno: Enable" command).
   - Step 7: Trigger any Deno extension functionality that invokes the Deno CLI. For instance, open a TypeScript or JavaScript file and observe if the extension tries to perform type checking or linting. Alternatively, try to run a Deno command via the command palette (e.g., "Deno: Cache").
  - Step 8: Verify if the malicious executable was executed. Check for the created file (`/tmp/deno_attack.txt` or `%TEMP%\deno_attack.txt`) or any other side effects implemented in the malicious script. If the file is created or the side effect is observed, the vulnerability is confirmed.
