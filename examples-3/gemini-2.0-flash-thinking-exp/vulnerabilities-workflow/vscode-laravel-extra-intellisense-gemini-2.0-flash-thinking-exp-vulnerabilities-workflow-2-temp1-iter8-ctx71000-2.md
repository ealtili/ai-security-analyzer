- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `phpCommand` configuration
- Description:
    - The `LaravelExtraIntellisense` extension allows users to customize the command used to execute PHP code through the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting.
    - This setting includes a `{code}` placeholder which is intended to be replaced by PHP code snippets generated by the extension to gather autocompletion data from the Laravel project.
    - A malicious user, or a user following insecure configuration instructions, could manually configure the `phpCommand` setting to inject arbitrary commands.
    - For example, a user might set `phpCommand` to `php -r "{code}; system($_GET['cmd']);"` or similar commands that execute shell commands based on input.
    - When the extension executes PHP code (for features like route, view, or config autocompletion), the injected commands within the malicious `phpCommand` will also be executed.

- Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the developer's machine.
    - The commands are executed with the same privileges as the VSCode process, which is typically the user's privileges.
    - This can lead to severe consequences, including:
        - Data theft: Attackers could access and exfiltrate sensitive files and data from the developer's machine and projects.
        - System compromise: Attackers could install malware, create backdoors, or gain persistent access to the developer's system.
        - Denial of Service: Attackers could execute commands that consume system resources, leading to a denial of service.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Security Note in `README.md`: The `README.md` file includes a "Security Note" section that warns users:
        > "This extension runs your Laravel application automatically and periodically to get the information needed to provide autocomplete. So if you have any unknown errors in your log make sure the extension not causing it. Also if you writing any sensitive code in your service providers, disable the extension temporarily to prevent unwanted application executing."
    - However, this is just a documentation warning and not a technical mitigation implemented in the code. The extension itself does not validate or sanitize the `phpCommand` configuration.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Validation and Sanitization: The extension should validate and sanitize the `phpCommand` setting to prevent users from injecting potentially dangerous commands.
        - Blacklisting dangerous functions: The extension could check for keywords like `system`, `exec`, `shell_exec`, `passthru`, `popen`, `proc_open`, and others in the configured `phpCommand` and warn or prevent the user from saving such configurations.
        - Parsing and analyzing the command: A more robust approach would be to parse the `phpCommand` string and ensure it only contains allowed components and arguments, preventing the injection of arbitrary shell commands.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: While customizing `phpCommand` provides flexibility, the default command should be as safe as possible and avoid constructs that easily lead to command injection.
    - Stronger Security Warnings and Secure Configuration Examples: The documentation should be significantly enhanced to:
        - Clearly and prominently warn users about the severe security risks of modifying the `phpCommand` setting, especially when copying configurations from untrusted sources.
        - Provide only secure and minimal configuration examples, avoiding any potentially dangerous constructs.
        - Emphasize that users should only modify this setting if they fully understand the security implications and are confident in their custom command.

- Preconditions:
    - User Configuration: The primary precondition is that a user must manually configure the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting with a malicious command.
    - Extension Activation: The extension needs to be activated, which typically happens when a user opens a Laravel project in VSCode and works with PHP or Blade files.
    - Triggering Autocompletion: The vulnerability is triggered when the extension attempts to gather autocompletion data, which occurs automatically in the background or when the user interacts with code in a way that triggers autocompletion features (e.g., typing route names, view names, etc.).

- Source Code Analysis:
    - `src/helpers.ts`:
        - The `runPhp` function is responsible for executing PHP code.
        - It retrieves the `phpCommand` setting using:
            ```typescript
            let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
            ```
        - It substitutes the `{code}` placeholder with the PHP code generated by the extension:
            ```typescript
            let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);
            ```
        - The resulting `command` is executed using `child_process.exec`:
            ```typescript
            cp.exec(command, ...);
            ```
        - **Vulnerability Point**: The code directly uses the user-provided `phpCommand` setting without any validation or sanitization. If a malicious command is placed in `phpCommand`, it will be executed.
        - The escaping performed on the `code` variable (escaping double quotes and dollar signs) is intended to make the PHP code itself safe for shell execution, but it does not mitigate the risk if the `phpCommand` template is already malicious.
    - No other code files directly contribute to mitigating this specific vulnerability related to `phpCommand` configuration.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup:
        - Open VSCode with any folder (a Laravel project is not strictly needed for this test, but having one makes it more realistic).
        - Install the `Laravel Extra Intellisense` extension.
    2. Malicious Configuration:
        - Open VSCode settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings).
        - Search for "LaravelExtraIntellisense: Php Command".
        - Modify the `phpCommand` setting to the following malicious command. This example will execute `calc.exe` on Windows. For Linux/macOS, use a different harmless command like `xcalc` or `open /Applications/Calculator.app`:
            ```
            php -r "{code}; system('calc.exe');"
            ```
        - Alternatively, for a simple test without external commands, use:
            ```
            php -r "{code}; echo 'VULNERABILITY-TRIGGERED';"
            ```
    3. Trigger Extension:
        - Open any PHP file in VSCode within the workspace. This action should be enough to trigger the extension to activate and attempt to gather autocompletion data in the background.
        - If the simple echo command was used, observe the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" output channel (View -> Output, then select "Laravel Extra Intellisense" from the dropdown). You should see "VULNERABILITY-TRIGGERED" in the output, indicating the injected command was executed.
        - If the `calc.exe` (or equivalent) command was used, observe that the Calculator application is launched on your system.
    4. Verification:
        - The execution of `calc.exe` or the "VULNERABILITY-TRIGGERED" message in the output channel confirms that arbitrary commands injected through the `phpCommand` configuration are indeed executed by the extension, demonstrating the command injection vulnerability.
