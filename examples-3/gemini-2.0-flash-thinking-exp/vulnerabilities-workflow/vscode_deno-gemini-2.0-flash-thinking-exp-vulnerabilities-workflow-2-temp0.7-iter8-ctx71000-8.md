- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Command Execution via Deno Path Configuration

- Description:
    1. An attacker tricks a user into configuring the `deno.path` setting in the VS Code Deno extension.
    2. The attacker provides a path to a malicious executable instead of the legitimate Deno CLI executable.
    3. The user saves the modified `deno.path` setting within VS Code.
    4. When the VS Code Deno extension initializes or attempts to use any Deno functionality (like starting the language server, running tests, formatting, caching, upgrading Deno, etc.), it resolves the Deno command path using the user-configured `deno.path` setting.
    5. Instead of executing the legitimate Deno CLI, the extension unknowingly executes the malicious executable specified in `deno.path`.
    6. The malicious executable runs with the privileges of the user running VS Code, leading to arbitrary command execution on the user's system.

- Impact:
    Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the same privileges as the VS Code process. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and further malicious activities.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The extension directly uses the path provided in the `deno.path` setting without any validation or sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `deno.path` setting. The extension should verify that the provided path is a valid executable and potentially check if it resembles a legitimate Deno CLI executable.
    - Display a warning message to the user when they are about to change the `deno.path` setting, especially if it's being changed to a location outside of standard Deno installation directories.
    - Consider using a file picker dialog for setting `deno.path` to guide users towards selecting the correct Deno executable and reducing the chance of manual path manipulation errors.
    - Implement runtime checks to verify the integrity of the executable being used as the Deno CLI, for example, by checking its digital signature or comparing its hash against known good values. (This might be complex and resource-intensive).

- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the VS Code Deno extension installed.
    - The attacker needs to convince the user to modify the `deno.path` setting in VS Code and point it to a malicious executable. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by compromising the user's VS Code settings file.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`client/src/util.ts:getDenoCommandPath()`**: This function is responsible for determining the path to the Deno executable.
    ```typescript
    export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
      const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath(); // [Vulnerable Code] Reads deno.path setting
      const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
      if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
        return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
      } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
        // ... (relative path resolution - not relevant to immediate vulnerability)
        return undefined;
      } else {
        return command; // [Vulnerable Code] Returns user-provided path directly
      }
    }
    ```
    Visualization:
    ```
    [VS Code Settings (deno.path)] --> getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() --> getDenoCommandPath() --> returns path
    ```
    The code directly retrieves the value of `deno.path` from VS Code settings using `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` and returns it without any checks if it's an absolute path.

    2. **`client/src/commands.ts:startLanguageServer()`**: This function uses the path from `getDenoCommandPath()` to start the Deno Language Server.
    ```typescript
    export function startLanguageServer(
      context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
      extensionContext: DenoExtensionContext,
    ): Callback {
      return async () => {
        // ...
        const command = await getDenoCommandPath(); // [Calls vulnerable function]
        if (command == null) {
          // ... error handling ...
          return;
        }

        const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
          run: {
            command, // [Vulnerable Code] Uses user-provided path as command
            args: ["lsp"],
            options: { env },
          },
          debug: {
            command, // [Vulnerable Code] Uses user-provided path as command
            args: ["lsp"],
            options: { env },
          },
        };
        const client = new LanguageClient( // Executes the command
          LANGUAGE_CLIENT_ID,
          LANGUAGE_CLIENT_NAME,
          serverOptions,
          {
            outputChannel: extensionContext.outputChannel,
            middleware: { /* ... */ },
            ...extensionContext.clientOptions,
          },
        );
        // ...
        await client.start(); // [Executes the command]
        // ...
      };
    }
    ```
    Visualization:
    ```
    getDenoCommandPath() --> command (path to executable) --> serverOptions.run.command --> LanguageClient --> client.start() --> Executes command
    ```
    The `startLanguageServer` function retrieves the command path using `getDenoCommandPath()` and directly uses it in `serverOptions.run.command` and `serverOptions.debug.command` which are then used by `LanguageClient` to execute the command. Similar patterns exist in `test` and `upgrade` commands.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a malicious executable:** Create a simple executable file (e.g., `malicious.bat` on Windows, `malicious.sh` on Linux/macOS) that performs a harmless but noticeable action, like displaying a message box or writing to a file. For example, on Windows, `echo Vulnerability Exploited > exploited.txt && pause` and on Linux/macOS, `echo "Vulnerability Exploited" > exploited.txt && sleep 5`.
    2. **Place the malicious executable:** Put this executable in a directory accessible to your user, for example, your user's home directory.
    3. **Open VS Code in a workspace:** Open any folder in VS Code as a workspace.
    4. **Modify User Settings:** Open VS Code settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings). Switch to the "User" settings tab to avoid workspace-specific settings.
    5. **Search for `deno.path`:** In the settings search bar, type `deno.path`.
    6. **Set `deno.path` to the malicious executable:**  In the "Deno â€º Path" setting, enter the absolute path to your malicious executable (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUser\malicious.bat` or `/home/youruser/malicious.sh`).
    7. **Enable Deno for the workspace:** If Deno is not already enabled, run the command "Deno: Enable" from the VS Code command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P). Alternatively, ensure `deno.enable` is set to `true` in your workspace or user settings.
    8. **Restart VS Code or Reload Window:**  Restart VS Code or reload the window (Developer: Reload Window from command palette) to ensure the new settings are applied and the Deno extension initializes.
    9. **Trigger Deno functionality:** Open any JavaScript or TypeScript file in the workspace. This should trigger the Deno language server to start. Alternatively, you can try to run a Deno test using the "Run Test" code lens if you have a test file.
    10. **Observe the execution:** Observe if the malicious executable is executed. You should see the message box (if using `pause` in batch) or find the `exploited.txt` file in your user directory, indicating that your malicious executable was run instead of the Deno CLI.
