### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `deno.path` setting

*   **Description:**
    1.  The VSCode Deno extension allows users to configure the path to the Deno executable using the `deno.path` setting.
    2.  A malicious user can craft a repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets `deno.path` to a malicious executable path.
    3.  When a victim opens this repository in VSCode and if Deno extension is enabled (or gets enabled due to `deno.json` presence or user action), the extension will attempt to execute the Deno CLI using the provided malicious path.
    4.  If the malicious path contains command injection sequences, these sequences will be executed by the system when the extension tries to start the Deno Language Server or run any Deno commands.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the victim's machine.
    *   An attacker can gain complete control over the victim's system, steal sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   The extension attempts to resolve `deno` executable from the environment path if `deno.path` is not set.
    *   The extension checks if the provided path exists and is a file using `fileExists` function in `util.ts`.
        ```typescript
        async function fileExists(executableFilePath: string): Promise<boolean> {
          return new Promise<boolean>((resolve) => {
            fs.stat(executableFilePath, (err, stat) => {
              resolve(err == null && stat.isFile());
            });
          }).catch(() => {
            // ignore all errors
            return false;
          });
        }
        ```
        This check only verifies if the file exists and is a file, but not if the path itself contains malicious commands.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Input sanitization and validation for the `deno.path` setting. The extension should sanitize the provided path to prevent command injection. It should ensure that the path does not contain shell metacharacters or command separators.
    *   Using `child_process.spawn` with `shell: false` option when executing the Deno CLI to avoid shell interpretation of the command and arguments. Currently, `vscode-languageclient` likely uses `child_process.spawn` under the hood, but it's important to verify and ensure it's used securely.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   Victim has VSCode installed with the Deno extension.
    *   Victim opens a malicious repository in VSCode.
    *   Deno extension is enabled for the workspace (either globally, or via workspace settings, or by detection of `deno.json`).
    *   Attacker can create a repository with a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **`client\src\util.ts` - `getDenoCommandPath()`:** This function retrieves the Deno command path.
        ```typescript
        export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
          const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
          const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
          if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
            return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
          } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
            // if sent a relative path, iterate over workspace folders to try and resolve.
            for (const workspace of workspaceFolders) {
              const commandPath = path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command);
              if (await fileExists(commandPath)) {
                return commandPath;
              }
            }
            return undefined;
          } else {
            return command;
          }
        }
        ```
        The `command` variable here comes directly from `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`.

    2.  **`client\src\util.ts` - `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`:** This function retrieves the `deno.path` setting from VSCode configuration.
        ```typescript
        function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
          const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)
            .get<string>("path");
          // it is possible for the path to be blank. In that case, return undefined
          if (typeof exePath === "string" && exePath.trim().length === 0) {
            return undefined;
          } else {
            return exePath;
          }
        }
        ```
        This directly fetches user-provided input without any sanitization.

    3.  **`client\src\commands.ts` - `startLanguageServer()`:** This function uses `getDenoCommandPath()` to get the command and then executes it.
        ```typescript
        // Start a new language server
        const command = await getDenoCommandPath();
        if (command == null) {
          // ... error handling ...
          return;
        }
        // ...
        const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
          run: {
            command, // Unsanitized user input
            args: ["lsp"],
            options: { env },
          },
          debug: {
            command, // Unsanitized user input
            // ...
            args: ["lsp"],
            options: { env },
          },
        };
        const client = new LanguageClient(
          LANGUAGE_CLIENT_ID,
          LANGUAGE_CLIENT_NAME,
          serverOptions,
          {
            outputChannel: extensionContext.outputChannel,
            middleware: {
              // ...
            },
            ...extensionContext.clientOptions,
          },
        );
        // ... client start ...
        ```
        The `command` variable, which is potentially malicious user input, is directly used in `serverOptions.run.command` and `serverOptions.debug.command` without sanitization, leading to potential command injection when `LanguageClient` starts the server.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    User Input (deno.path in .vscode/settings.json) --> getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() --> getDenoCommandPath() --> startLanguageServer() --> LanguageClient (executes command) --> Command Injection
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  Create a new directory `malicious-repo`.
    2.  Inside `malicious-repo`, create a `.vscode` directory.
    3.  Inside `.vscode`, create a `settings.json` file with the following content (for Windows, adapt for Linux/macOS):
        ```json
        {
          "deno.path": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c calc.exe && C:\\Windows\\System32\\deno.exe"
        }
        ```
        For Linux/macOS, use:
        ```json
        {
          "deno.path": "/bin/sh -c 'calc' && /usr/bin/deno"
        }
        ```
        (Note: `calc` is just an example, a more malicious command can be used. Ensure `deno` is a valid path to the real deno executable after the injection part for the extension to function somewhat normally afterwards).
        (Note: `/usr/bin/deno` is an example, adjust to the correct deno executable path if needed)
    4.  Open the `malicious-repo` in VSCode.
    5.  Ensure the Deno extension is enabled (or enable it if prompted or using command `Deno: Enable`).
    6.  Observe that the calculator application (or equivalent command) is executed when the Deno extension starts or restarts the language server. This indicates successful command injection.

#### 2. Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Deno Task Definitions

*   **Description:**
    1.  The VSCode Deno extension allows defining tasks in `tasks.json` or `deno.json` configuration files.
    2.  A malicious user can create a repository with a crafted `tasks.json` or `deno.json` file that contains malicious commands in the `command` or `args` properties of a task definition.
    3.  When a victim opens this repository in VSCode and if the task sidebar is used or tasks are executed (either manually or via code lens), the extension will execute the defined tasks.
    4.  If the `command` or `args` in the task definition contain command injection sequences, these sequences will be executed by the system when the task is run.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the victim's machine.
    *   An attacker can gain control over the victim's system when they interact with the task features of the extension.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   The extension relies on VSCode's task execution framework. VSCode tasks are generally designed to execute commands, so there might be an implicit assumption that users should only execute tasks from trusted sources. However, there is no specific input sanitization or validation performed by the Deno extension on task definitions to prevent command injection.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Input sanitization and validation for task `command` and `args` properties in `tasks.json` and `deno.json` files. The extension should sanitize these inputs to prevent command injection.
    *   Ideally, the extension should use `child_process.spawn` with `shell: false` when executing tasks, ensuring arguments are passed directly and not interpreted by a shell.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   Victim has VSCode installed with the Deno extension.
    *   Victim opens a malicious repository in VSCode.
    *   Victim interacts with the task features, either by running a task from the task sidebar, or by triggering a task via code lens (e.g., test code lens).
    *   Attacker can create a repository with a malicious `tasks.json` or `deno.json` file.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **`client\src\tasks.ts` - `buildDenoTask()`:** This function constructs a `vscode.Task` object.
        ```typescript
        export function buildDenoTask(
          target: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
          process: string,
          definition: DenoTaskDefinition,
          name: string,
          args: string[],
          problemMatchers: string[],
        ): vscode.Task {
          const exec = new vscode.ProcessExecution(
            process, // Unsanitized process path (potentially from deno.path)
            args,    // Unsanitized task arguments (potentially from tasks.json/deno.json)
            definition,
          );

          return new vscode.Task(
            definition,
            target,
            name,
            TASK_SOURCE,
            exec,
            problemMatchers,
          );
        }
        ```
        The `process` argument can come from `deno.path` setting (as seen in Vulnerability 1), and `args` comes directly from task definitions, both are potentially user-controlled and unsanitized.

    2.  **`client\src\tasks.ts` - `DenoTaskProvider.resolveTask()` and `provideTasks()`:** These functions are responsible for providing and resolving tasks, using `buildDenoTask()` to create task objects. The task definitions are parsed from `tasks.json` and `deno.json` files (although not explicitly shown in provided files, the description mentions it).

    3.  **`client\src\tasks_sidebar.ts` - Task execution:** The task sidebar and related commands (`deno.client.runTask`, `deno.client.debugTask`) trigger the execution of these tasks via `vscode.tasks.executeTask()`.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Malicious Task Definition (tasks.json/deno.json) --> DenoTaskProvider (parses tasks) --> buildDenoTask() --> ProcessExecution (executes command and args) --> Command Injection
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  Create a new directory `malicious-task-repo`.
    2.  Inside `malicious-task-repo`, create a `.vscode` directory.
    3.  Inside `.vscode`, create a `tasks.json` file with the following content (for Windows, adapt for Linux/macOS):
        ```json
        {
          "version": "2.0.0",
          "tasks": [
            {
              "type": "deno",
              "command": "run",
              "args": [
                "-A",
                "-c",
                "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c calc.exe"
              ],
              "label": "Malicious Task"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
        For Linux/macOS, use:
        ```json
        {
          "version": "2.0.0",
          "tasks": [
            {
              "type": "deno",
              "command": "run",
              "args": [
                "-A",
                "-c",
                "/bin/sh -c 'calc'"
              ],
              "label": "Malicious Task"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
    4.  Open the `malicious-task-repo` in VSCode.
    5.  Open the Task sidebar (if not visible, View -> Open View -> Deno Tasks).
    6.  Find the "Malicious Task" in the Deno Tasks sidebar.
    7.  Right-click on "Malicious Task" and select "Run Task".
    8.  Observe that the calculator application (or equivalent command) is executed. This indicates successful command injection via task definition.

### Missing General Mitigations for Command Injection:

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** When executing external commands, ensure that the process runs with the minimum necessary privileges.
*   **Secure Defaults:**  Default to safe configurations and avoid features that are inherently risky unless explicitly enabled by the user with clear warnings.
*   **User Education:**  Educate users about the risks of opening repositories from untrusted sources and executing code or tasks from them. VSCode itself provides workspace trust features which can be leveraged and emphasized.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.
