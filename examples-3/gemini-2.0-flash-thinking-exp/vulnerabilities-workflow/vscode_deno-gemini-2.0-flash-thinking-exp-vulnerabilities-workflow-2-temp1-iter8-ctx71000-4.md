- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Deno Configuration Files

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious workspace.
    2. Within this workspace, the attacker creates a `deno.config` or `deno.importMap` file.
    3. In these configuration files, the attacker specifies file paths that include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `../../`).
    4. A user opens this malicious workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Deno extension enabled.
    5. The Deno extension reads the `deno.config` or `deno.importMap` file.
    6. The extension uses the attacker-controlled path from the configuration file to access files on the user's system.
    7. Due to the lack of path traversal sanitization, the extension may access files outside the workspace directory, potentially leading to arbitrary file access.

- Impact:
    - Arbitrary file read: An attacker can read sensitive files on the user's system by crafting a malicious workspace and enticing the user to open it. This could include source code, configuration files, or personal documents, depending on the user's file system structure and the attacker's crafted path.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided project files. The code reads the configuration paths from settings and uses them directly without sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Path sanitization: The extension should sanitize the paths provided in `deno.config` and `deno.importMap` settings to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. This can be achieved by:
        - Resolving paths relative to the workspace root.
        - Validating that the resolved path stays within the workspace boundaries.
        - Using secure path manipulation functions that prevent traversal.

- Preconditions:
    1. The user must have the "Deno for Visual Studio Code" extension installed and enabled.
    2. The user must open a workspace that contains a malicious `deno.config` or `deno.importMap` file crafted by the attacker.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Configuration Loading:** The extension reads the `deno.config` and `deno.importMap` settings from VS Code's workspace configuration. This is evident in files like `client/src/commands.ts` and `client/src/debug_config_provider.ts` where `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)` is used to access these settings.
    2. **Path Usage:** The values obtained from `deno.config` and `deno.importMap` settings are treated as file paths. For example, in `README.md` and `docs/configuration.md`, it is described that `deno.config` and `deno.importMap` settings accept file paths which can be relative to the workspace or absolute.
    3. **Lack of Sanitization:**  There is no visible code in the provided files that sanitizes or validates these paths against path traversal attacks before using them to access files. The extension appears to trust the paths provided in the configuration without proper checks.

    To visualize, consider the following simplified code snippet (non-existent in provided files, but illustrative of the vulnerability):

    ```typescript
    // Hypothetical vulnerable code
    import * as fs from 'fs';
    import * as path from 'path';
    import * as vscode from 'vscode';

    async function processDenoConfig() {
        const config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('deno');
        const configPath = config.get<string>('config'); // User-provided path

        if (configPath) {
            // Vulnerable: Directly using user-provided path without sanitization
            const resolvedConfigPath = path.resolve(vscode.workspace.rootPath, configPath);
            if (!resolvedConfigPath.startsWith(vscode.workspace.rootPath)) {
                console.warn("Path traversal detected!"); // Missing in actual code
                return;
            }
            try {
                const configContent = await fs.promises.readFile(resolvedConfigPath, 'utf8');
                // Process configContent
                console.log("Config content:", configContent);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error("Error reading config file:", error);
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    In the above hypothetical example, even with `path.resolve`, if `configPath` contains `../../`, it can still traverse out of the intended directory if not properly validated against workspace root. The actual extension code, based on the provided files, does not show evidence of even such basic checks. It is likely directly passing these paths to Deno CLI or internal file system operations without validation.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Workspace:**
        - Create a new directory named `malicious-workspace`.
        - Inside `malicious-workspace`, create a file named `import_map.json` with the following content:
            ```json
            {
              "imports": {
                "malicious": "../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd"
              }
            }
            ```
        - Create a file named `test.ts` in `malicious-workspace` with the following content:
            ```typescript
            import * as passwd from "malicious";
            console.log(passwd);
            ```
        - Create `.vscode` directory inside `malicious-workspace`.
        - Inside `.vscode`, create `settings.json` with the following content:
            ```json
            {
              "deno.enable": true,
              "deno.importMap": "./import_map.json"
            }
            ```
    2. **Open Malicious Workspace in VSCode:**
        - Open the `malicious-workspace` directory in Visual Studio Code.
        - Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace (it should be based on `.vscode/settings.json`).
    3. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Open `test.ts`.
        - If the extension attempts to process the import map and access the file specified in the malicious path, it will attempt to read `/etc/passwd`. Depending on the extension's behavior and error handling, this might result in:
            - An error message in the Deno extension's output channel indicating a failed file read (which still confirms the attempted path traversal).
            - If the extension further processes the content (unlikely for `/etc/passwd` but possible for other file types), it might expose the content or trigger unexpected behavior.
    4. **Observe the Impact:**
        - Check the Deno extension's output channel for any error messages related to file access or path traversal.
        - Monitor file system access (using system tools if necessary) to see if the extension attempts to read files outside the workspace directory.
    5. **Expected Result:**
        - The test should demonstrate that the Deno extension attempts to access a file outside the workspace based on the path provided in `import_map.json`, indicating a path traversal vulnerability. Ideally, the test should be designed to observe an error message or file access attempt that confirms the vulnerability without causing system instability or exposing sensitive information unnecessarily (e.g., attempt to read a non-sensitive file outside the workspace that is expected to exist on most systems, and check for an error if access is denied, or use a debugger to inspect file access attempts).
