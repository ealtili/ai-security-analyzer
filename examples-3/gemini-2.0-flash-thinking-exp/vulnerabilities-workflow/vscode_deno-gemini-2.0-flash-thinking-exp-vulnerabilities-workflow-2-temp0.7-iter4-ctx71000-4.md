- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious `deno.path` Configuration

- **Description:**
    1. A malicious actor can trick a user into configuring the `deno.path` setting in their VS Code workspace to point to a malicious executable instead of the legitimate Deno CLI.
    2. This can be achieved through social engineering, by providing a crafted workspace configuration file, or by other means of persuading the user to manually alter the setting.
    3. When the VS Code Deno extension attempts to invoke Deno for various features (like type checking, linting, formatting, testing, caching, or running tasks), it will use the path specified in `deno.path`.
    4. If `deno.path` points to a malicious executable, this executable will be executed with the privileges of the user running VS Code, leading to arbitrary code execution on their machine.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and further propagation of attacks.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **None:** The code currently reads the `deno.path` setting from the VS Code configuration and directly uses it to execute the command without any validation or sanitization. There are no checks to verify if the provided path is a legitimate Deno executable or to restrict the path to specific locations.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation:** Implement validation for the `deno.path` setting to ensure it points to a valid and expected executable. This could include:
        - Checking if the executable exists at the given path.
        - Verifying if the executable is indeed the Deno CLI (e.g., by checking its version or signature).
        - Restricting the path to a set of allowed directories or prompting for user confirmation if the path is outside of standard locations.
    - **User Warning:** Display a warning message to the user if the `deno.path` setting is changed from the default, especially if it points to a location outside of standard installation directories.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** While not directly mitigating the code execution, consider if the extension needs to run Deno CLI with elevated privileges. Running with the least necessary privileges can limit the impact of potential exploits.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The VS Code Deno extension must be installed and activated.
    - A workspace must be opened in VS Code.
    - The user must have the ability to modify workspace settings or be tricked into importing malicious settings.
    - The attacker needs to provide or convince the user to set a malicious executable path in the `deno.path` setting.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File: `client\src\util.ts`**
        - Function `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` reads the `deno.path` setting from VS Code configuration:
            ```typescript
            function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
              const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)
                .get<string>("path");
              // it is possible for the path to be blank. In that case, return undefined
              if (typeof exePath === "string" && exePath.trim().length === 0) {
                return undefined;
              } else {
                return exePath;
              }
            }
            ```
        - Function `getDenoCommandPath()` resolves the Deno command path, prioritizing the `deno.path` setting:
            ```typescript
            export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
              const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
              const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
              if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
                return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
              } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
                // if sent a relative path, iterate over workspace folders to try and resolve.
                for (const workspace of workspaceFolders) {
                  const commandPath = path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command);
                  if (await fileExists(commandPath)) {
                    return commandPath;
                  }
                }
                return undefined;
              } else {
                return command;
              }
            }
            ```
        - **Visualization:**
            ```mermaid
            graph LR
                subgraph VS Code Configuration
                    A[deno.path Setting]
                end
                subgraph client\src\util.ts
                    B[getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()] --> A
                    C[getDenoCommandPath()] --> B
                    D[getDenoCommandName()] --> C
                    E[ProcessExecution in tasks.ts/debug_config_provider.ts etc.] --> D
                end
                A --> B
                C --> E
            ```
        - **Explanation:** The code flow clearly shows that the `deno.path` setting from the VS Code configuration is directly retrieved by `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()` and used by `getDenoCommandPath()` to determine the Deno executable path. This path is then used to create `ProcessExecution` instances in various parts of the extension (e.g., for tasks, debugging). There is no input validation at any point in this process.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a new directory named `malicious_deno`.
        - Inside `malicious_deno`, create a file named `deno.exe` (or `deno` for non-Windows systems) with the following content (example for bash, adapt for other shells or platforms):
            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "[VULNERABILITY TEST] Malicious Deno Executed!"
            echo "This is proof of arbitrary code execution."
            # Optionally, attempt to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious actions
            exit 1 # Exit with an error to avoid interfering with extension functionality
            ```
        - Make the malicious script executable: `chmod +x malicious_deno/deno.exe` (or `chmod +x malicious_deno/deno`).
    2. **VS Code Workspace Configuration:**
        - Open VS Code and create or open any workspace.
        - Open VS Code settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings).
        - Go to Workspace settings.
        - Search for `deno.path`.
        - Set the `Deno â€º Path` setting to the absolute path of the malicious executable created in step 1 (e.g., `/path/to/malicious_deno/deno.exe`).
    3. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Open a TypeScript or JavaScript file in the workspace that the Deno extension would process.
        - Execute a Deno extension command that invokes the Deno CLI. For example:
            - Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
            - Type and select "Deno: Cache".
            - Select the current file URI if prompted.
    4. **Verification:**
        - Open the Output panel in VS Code (View -> Output).
        - In the dropdown menu at the top-right of the Output panel, select "Deno Language Server".
        - Check the output for the line: `[VULNERABILITY TEST] Malicious Deno Executed!`
        - If this message is present, it confirms that the malicious executable was executed when the Deno extension tried to invoke the Deno CLI, proving the arbitrary code execution vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to achieve arbitrary code execution on a user's machine by exploiting the `deno.path` configuration setting of the VS Code Deno extension.
