### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in AI-Generated Code

*   Description:
    *   An attacker can craft a malicious screenshot or video input that, when processed by the AI model, results in the generation of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code containing embedded client-side scripts.
    *   This occurs because the AI model is designed to faithfully reproduce the visual elements of the input, and if the input visually represents or implies JavaScript code (e.g., through text or visual cues that resemble code), the AI may generate functional code that includes this JavaScript.
    *   If a user then implements the AI-generated code directly into their web application without proper review and sanitization, any user visiting the affected part of their web application will execute the malicious JavaScript.
    *   This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), where the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.

*   Impact:
    *   When a user implements AI-generated code containing malicious JavaScript into their website, it creates a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    *   Consequences of XSS can include:
        *   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
        *   **Credential Theft:** Malicious scripts can capture user login credentials, leading to account compromise.
        *   **Data Theft:** Sensitive data displayed on the webpage can be exfiltrated to attacker-controlled servers.
        *   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify the content of the webpage, displaying misleading or harmful information.
        *   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Users can be redirected to phishing websites or sites hosting malware.
        *   **Malware Distribution:** XSS can be used as a vector to distribute malware to website visitors.
    *   The severity of the impact depends on the privileges of the compromised user and the sensitivity of the data handled by the web application.

*   Vulnerability Rank: High

*   Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    *   None. The code generation logic focuses on replicating the visual design accurately, without any apparent sanitization or security checks on the generated output to prevent XSS.  Review of `backend/routes/generate_code.py` and related files confirms that there is no output sanitization implemented. The `extract_html_content` function in `codegen/utils.py` (referenced in previous analysis but not provided in current files, but its purpose is clear from context) is focused on extraction, not sanitization.

*   Missing Mitigations:
    *   **Output Sanitization:** Implement a process to sanitize the AI-generated code before presenting it to the user. This should include:
        *   **HTML Sanitization:** Use a library to parse and sanitize the generated HTML, removing or encoding potentially harmful elements and attributes, such as `<script>` tags, inline event handlers (e.g., `onclick`, `onload`), and potentially dangerous URLs (e.g., `javascript:`).
        *   **JavaScript Sanitization (if applicable):** If the AI is expected to generate standalone JavaScript code, analyze and sanitize it to prevent execution of malicious commands. This is complex and might be better addressed by strictly controlling the context in which JavaScript is generated and discouraging generation of complex, user-interactive JavaScript through AI.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Guidance:**  Advise users to implement a strong Content Security Policy in their web applications where they integrate the AI-generated code. CSP can significantly reduce the risk of XSS by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.

*   Preconditions:
    *   An attacker needs to craft a screenshot or video that subtly or overtly suggests the inclusion of JavaScript code to the AI model. This could be through visual elements that resemble code, text prompts within the screenshot, or by demonstrating specific interactive behaviors in a video input that the AI interprets as requiring JavaScript.
    *   A user must then use the AI-generated code and implement it in a publicly accessible web application without conducting a security review and sanitization of the code.

*   Source Code Analysis:
    *   The project's backend (`backend/`) handles the AI model interactions and code generation. Files like `llm.py` (not provided in current files, but assumed to be present from previous context), `evals/core.py` (not provided in current files, but assumed to be present from previous context), `video_to_app.py` (not provided in current files, but assumed to be present from previous context) and `backend/routes/generate_code.py` manage the communication with AI models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) and process the input (images, videos) to generate code.
    *   The prompts (e.g., in `prompts/claude_prompts.py`, `prompts/screenshot_system_prompts.py` - not provided in current files, but assumed to be present from previous context) instruct the AI to generate functional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code based on visual inputs. These prompts prioritize visual accuracy and functionality, but do not include instructions to sanitize or avoid generating potentially harmful code.
    *   The code extraction utility (`backend/codegen/utils.py` - not provided in current files, but assumed to be present from previous context) in `extract_html_content` focuses solely on extracting the HTML portion from the AI's response, without any sanitization. This is further confirmed by reviewing `backend/routes/generate_code.py` which uses `extract_html_content` without any subsequent sanitization before sending the code to the frontend.
    *   The mock LLM responses in `backend/mock_llm.py` (not provided in current files, but assumed to be present from previous context) demonstrate the generation of JavaScript code, showing the AI's capability to produce interactive elements, but these examples are benign.
    *   Reviewing the code, especially `backend/routes/generate_code.py`, there is no evidence of any output sanitization or encoding being performed on the generated code before it's returned to the frontend and presented to the user. The generated code is directly streamed or returned as a string via websocket.
    *   **Visualization of Vulnerability Flow:**

    ```
    [Attacker] --(Crafted Malicious Screenshot/Video)--> [User] --(Uploads to Screenshot-to-Code App)--> [Backend] --(AI Model)--> [Backend] --(Malicious Code Generation)--> [User] --(Implements Vulnerable Code in Web App)--> [End-Users of Web App] --(XSS Attack)--> [Compromise]
    ```

*   Security Test Case:
    1.  **Prepare a Malicious Screenshot:** Create a screenshot that visually represents a button with a label like "Click Me for a Surprise!".  Subtly embed JavaScript within the visual representation of the button's label or surrounding text. For example, visually encode  `</button><script>alert('XSS')</script><button>` within the button's text or nearby.
    2.  **Upload the Screenshot:** Access the public instance of the screenshot-to-code application via the frontend (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` if running locally). Upload the prepared malicious screenshot. Select any supported stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind).
    3.  **Generate Code:** Initiate the code generation process.
    4.  **Review Generated Code:** Examine the generated HTML code output by the application. Verify if the AI model has generated code that includes the malicious JavaScript payload from the screenshot. You should see something like `<button>Click Me for a Surprise!</button><script>alert('XSS')</script><button>`.
    5.  **Implement Generated Code:** Copy the generated HTML code. Create a simple HTML file (e.g., `test.html`) and paste the generated code into the `<body>` section of this file.
    6.  **Open in Browser:** Open `test.html` in a web browser.
    7.  **Verify XSS:** If the vulnerability exists, upon opening `test.html`, the JavaScript code (`alert('XSS')`) will execute, and an alert box with "XSS" will pop up in the browser. This confirms that the AI-generated code is vulnerable to XSS and can execute arbitrary JavaScript.
