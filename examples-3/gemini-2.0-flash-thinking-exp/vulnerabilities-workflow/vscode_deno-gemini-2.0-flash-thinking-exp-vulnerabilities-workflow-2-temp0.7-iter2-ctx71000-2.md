- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Deno Path Execution
- Description:
    1. An attacker socially engineers a user to modify the `deno.path` setting in VS Code.
    2. The user is tricked into setting `deno.path` to point to a malicious executable instead of the legitimate Deno CLI.
    3. The VS Code Deno extension, upon activation or restart, retrieves the Deno command path from the `deno.path` setting.
    4. When the extension needs to execute Deno CLI commands (e.g., for language server, formatting, linting, testing), it uses the path specified in `deno.path`.
    5. Because `deno.path` is pointing to the malicious executable, the extension unknowingly executes the attacker's code instead of the real Deno CLI.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.
    - Potential data theft, malware installation, or system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly uses the path provided in the `deno.path` setting without validation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation for the `deno.path` setting. The extension should validate that the provided path is a legitimate Deno executable, possibly by checking file signature or running basic checks.
    - User warning when `deno.path` is changed. A warning message should be displayed to the user when they modify the `deno.path` setting, emphasizing the security risks of pointing it to untrusted executables and advising them to only point it to the legitimate Deno CLI.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the VS Code Deno extension installed.
    - The user must be socially engineered to manually change the `deno.path` setting in VS Code to a malicious executable path.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `client\src\commands.ts`
    2. Function: `startLanguageServer`
    3. Line: `const command = await getDenoCommandPath();`
    4. This line calls the `getDenoCommandPath` function to retrieve the path to the Deno executable.
    5. File: `client\src\util.ts`
    6. Function: `getDenoCommandPath`
    7. Line: `const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();`
    8. This line retrieves the value of the `deno.path` setting from the workspace configuration using `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`.
    9. Function: `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath`
    10. Line: `const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS).get<string>("path");`
    11. This line directly fetches the string value of `deno.path` setting without any validation.
    12. If `deno.path` is set, the extension uses this path directly to execute Deno commands. If `deno.path` is not set, it attempts to resolve "deno" from the system's PATH environment variable.
    13. There is no validation in the code to check if the path from `deno.path` setting points to a legitimate Deno executable or any executable at all.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Pre-requisites:
        - Install VS Code and the Deno extension.
        - Install the legitimate Deno CLI (optional, for comparison).
    2. Create a malicious script (e.g., `malicious_deno.sh` for Linux/macOS or `malicious_deno.bat` for Windows) that simulates Deno but also performs a malicious action. For example, a simple script that writes to a file in the user's home directory:
        - `malicious_deno.sh` (Linux/macOS):
          ```bash
          #!/bin/bash
          echo "Malicious Deno executed!"
          date > /tmp/malicious_deno_executed.txt
          /path/to/legitimate/deno "$@" # Optional: Forward arguments to legitimate Deno for partial functionality
          ```
        - `malicious_deno.bat` (Windows):
          ```bat
          @echo off
          echo Malicious Deno executed!
          date > %TEMP%\malicious_deno_executed.txt
          if exist "C:\path\to\legitimate\deno.exe" "C:\path\to\legitimate\deno.exe" %* # Optional: Forward arguments to legitimate Deno for partial functionality
          ```
        - Make the script executable (`chmod +x malicious_deno.sh` on Linux/macOS).
        - Replace `/path/to/legitimate/deno` and `C:\path\to\legitimate\deno.exe` with the actual path to the legitimate Deno CLI if you want to forward arguments.
    3. Store the malicious script in a known location on your system (e.g., `/tmp/malicious_deno.sh` or `C:\Temp\malicious_deno.bat`).
    4. Open VS Code.
    5. Open the settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings).
    6. Search for "deno.path".
    7. Edit the `Deno â€º Path` setting and set it to the path of your malicious script (e.g., `/tmp/malicious_deno.sh` or `C:\Temp\malicious_deno.bat`).
    8. If Deno extension is not already enabled, enable it by running the "Deno: Enable" command from the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
    9. Open any Deno project or create a new one. Observe if the malicious script is executed. For example, check if the `/tmp/malicious_deno_executed.txt` (or `%TEMP%\malicious_deno_executed.txt` on Windows) file is created and contains the current date and time.
    10. To further confirm, try using Deno extension features that execute Deno CLI, such as:
        - Formatting a Deno file (Format Document).
        - Linting a Deno file (Deno: Lint command).
        - Caching dependencies (Deno: Cache command).
        - Running tests (if you have tests in your project).
    11. Verify that each of these actions triggers the execution of your malicious script.
    12. Expected result: The malicious script is executed whenever the Deno extension attempts to use the Deno CLI, proving the vulnerability.
