### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `deno.path` setting

* Description:
    1. The VSCode Deno extension allows users to specify the path to the Deno executable using the `deno.path` setting.
    2. This setting can be configured at the user level, workspace level, or workspace folder level.
    3. The extension uses `child_process.spawn` (indirectly via `vscode-languageclient`) to execute the Deno CLI with arguments provided by the extension.
    4. If a malicious user can influence the `deno.path` setting to point to a malicious executable, or an executable path containing command injection, they can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) when the extension attempts to start the Deno Language Server or execute Deno commands.
    5. An attacker can achieve this by crafting a malicious repository that includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file with a manipulated `deno.path` setting.
    6. When a victim opens this malicious repository in VSCode and the Deno extension is activated, the extension will attempt to use the malicious path, leading to command injection.
    7. For example, a malicious repository could include `.vscode/settings.json` with the following content:
        ```json
        {
            "deno.path": "node_modules/.bin/malicious-script"
        }
        ```
        or
        ```json
        {
            "deno.path": "/path/to/deno; touch /tmp/pwned"
        }
        ```
    8. When the extension starts the language server, it will execute the command specified in `deno.path`, potentially running arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

* Impact:
    * Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This could lead to complete compromise of the victim's system, data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None. The extension directly uses the path provided in the settings to execute the Deno CLI.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * Input validation and sanitization for the `deno.path` setting. The extension should validate that the provided path is a valid path to an executable and does not contain any malicious commands or shell injection sequences.
    * Restricting the `deno.path` setting to be configurable only at the user level, or providing a warning if it is configured at the workspace level. This would reduce the risk of malicious repositories automatically triggering the vulnerability.
    * Using `child_process.spawn` with `shell: false` to avoid shell interpretation of the command path.

* Preconditions:
    * The victim must have the VSCode Deno extension installed and enabled.
    * The victim must open a malicious repository in VSCode that contains a `.vscode/settings.json` file with a manipulated `deno.path` setting.
    * The Deno extension must be activated in the opened workspace.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `client\src\util.ts`**:
        ```typescript
        export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
          const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
          // ...
          return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
        }

        function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
          const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)
            .get<string>("path");
          return exePath;
        }
        ```
        This code retrieves the `deno.path` setting directly from VSCode configuration without any validation.

    2. **File: `client\src\commands.ts`**:
        ```typescript
        export function startLanguageServer(
          context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
          extensionContext: DenoExtensionContext,
        ): Callback {
          return async () => {
            // ...
            const command = await getDenoCommandPath(); // Path is retrieved here
            if (command == null) {
              // ...
              return;
            }

            const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
              run: {
                command, // Malicious command from settings is used here
                args: ["lsp"],
                options: { env },
              },
              debug: {
                command, // Malicious command from settings is used here
                args: ["lsp"],
                options: { env },
              },
            };
            const client = new LanguageClient(
              LANGUAGE_CLIENT_ID,
              LANGUAGE_CLIENT_NAME,
              serverOptions,
              {
                // ...
              },
            );
            await client.start();
            // ...
          };
        }
        ```
        The `startLanguageServer` function uses the `command` obtained from `getDenoCommandPath()` directly in `ServerOptions.run.command` and `ServerOptions.debug.command` for the LanguageClient. The `LanguageClient` uses `child_process.spawn` internally to execute this command.  Because `child_process.spawn` is used without `shell: false` and without sanitizing the `command`, it can be vulnerable to command injection if the `command` is user-controlled and not properly validated.

    *Visualization:*

    ```
    User Setting "deno.path" --> getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() --> getDenoCommandPath() --> startLanguageServer() --> LanguageClient (child_process.spawn) --> Command Execution
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new directory named `malicious-repo`.
    2. Inside `malicious-repo`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
        ```json
        {
            "deno.path": "/bin/bash -c 'touch /tmp/vscode-deno-pwned'"
        }
        ```
        *(Note: For Windows, use `deno.path": "cmd.exe /c type nul >> %TEMP%\\vscode-deno-pwned.txt"` or similar)*
    4. Open VSCode and open the `malicious-repo` directory as a workspace.
    5. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace (if prompted, enable it, or ensure `"deno.enable": true` is set in workspace settings).
    6. Observe if a file named `vscode-deno-pwned` is created in the `/tmp/` directory (or `%TEMP%` on Windows) after VSCode initializes the Deno extension and attempts to start the language server.
    7. If the file is created, it confirms that the command injection vulnerability is present, and arbitrary commands can be executed via the `deno.path` setting.
