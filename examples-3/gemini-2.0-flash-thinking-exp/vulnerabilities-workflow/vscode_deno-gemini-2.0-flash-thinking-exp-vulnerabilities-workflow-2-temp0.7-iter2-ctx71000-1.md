### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Malicious Workspace Configuration - Arbitrary Code Execution via `deno.path`
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious VSCode workspace configuration file (`.vscode/settings.json`).
    2. Within this configuration file, the attacker sets the `deno.path` setting to point to a malicious executable file instead of the legitimate Deno CLI executable. For example, they might set it to `/tmp/malicious_deno` or `C:\evil\deno.exe`.
    3. The victim user opens this malicious workspace in VSCode with the Deno extension installed and enabled.
    4. When the Deno extension initializes or attempts to execute any Deno CLI command (e.g., for language server, formatting, testing, caching, etc.), it reads the `deno.path` setting from the workspace configuration.
    5. The extension, without proper validation, uses the provided path to execute the program.
    6. Instead of executing the legitimate Deno CLI, the extension unknowingly executes the malicious executable specified in `deno.path`.
    7. The malicious executable runs with the privileges of the VSCode process, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
    - Potential for data theft, malware installation, system compromise, and other malicious activities depending on the attacker's payload in the malicious executable.
    - Full control over the user's system is possible if the malicious executable is designed to escalate privileges or establish persistence.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension currently trusts the user-provided path in the `deno.path` setting without any validation or sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation:** Implement validation for the `deno.path` setting to ensure it points to a legitimate Deno CLI executable. This could include:
        - Checking if the path is an absolute path.
        - Verifying that the file exists at the specified path.
        - Checking if the file is executable.
        - Potentially validating the file's digital signature or hash against known Deno CLI signatures.
        - Restricting the path to be within a set of trusted directories or requiring explicit user confirmation for paths outside of standard locations.
    - **User Warning:** Display a warning message to the user when the `deno.path` setting is changed, especially if it points to a location outside of standard installation directories.
    - **Path Sanitization:** Sanitize the `deno.path` input to prevent command injection or other path manipulation vulnerabilities, although in this case, the primary issue is execution of an arbitrary program, not path manipulation itself.
- Preconditions:
    - The victim user must have the VSCode Deno extension installed and enabled.
    - The attacker must be able to influence the workspace settings of the victim, for example by:
        - Convincing the victim to open a malicious workspace (e.g., by cloning a malicious repository).
        - Compromising a settings synchronization mechanism used by the victim.
        - Socially engineering the victim into manually changing the `deno.path` setting.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`client/src/util.ts` - `getDenoCommandPath()`:**
        ```typescript
        export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
          const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath(); // Retrieves deno.path setting
          const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
          if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
            return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
          } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
            // if sent a relative path, iterate over workspace folders to try and resolve.
            for (const workspace of workspaceFolders) {
              const commandPath = path.resolve(workspace.uri.fsPath, command);
              if (await fileExists(commandPath)) { // Checks if file exists
                return commandPath; // Returns the path without further validation
              }
            }
            return undefined;
          } else {
            return command; // Returns the path directly from settings without validation
          }
        }
        ```
        - The `getDenoCommandPath` function is responsible for determining the path to the Deno CLI executable.
        - It first attempts to retrieve the path from the workspace configuration using `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`.
        - If a path is configured (`deno.path` is set), it prioritizes this path.
        - For relative paths, it tries to resolve them within workspace folders, but for absolute paths (and after resolution), it directly returns the path without any security checks or validation other than `fileExists`.
        - **Vulnerability:** The function trusts the `deno.path` setting implicitly. If a malicious absolute path is provided, it will be used without question.

    2. **`client/src/commands.ts` - `startLanguageServer()`:**
        ```typescript
        export function startLanguageServer(
          context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
          extensionContext: DenoExtensionContext,
        ): Callback {
          return async () => {
            // ...
            const command = await getDenoCommandPath(); // Gets the deno command path
            if (command == null) {
              // ... error handling ...
              return;
            }
            // ...
            const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
              run: {
                command, // Malicious path is used as command
                args: ["lsp"],
                options: { env },
              },
              debug: {
                command, // Malicious path is used as command
                args: ["lsp"],
                options: { env },
              },
            };
            const client = new LanguageClient( // LanguageClient uses serverOptions to spawn process
              LANGUAGE_CLIENT_ID,
              LANGUAGE_CLIENT_NAME,
              serverOptions,
              {
                outputChannel: extensionContext.outputChannel,
                middleware: { /* ... */ },
                ...extensionContext.clientOptions,
              },
            );
            // ... client start ...
          };
        }
        ```
        - `startLanguageServer` calls `getDenoCommandPath()` to get the executable path.
        - This path is then directly used as the `command` in `serverOptions` for the Language Client.
        - The Language Client uses this `serverOptions` to spawn the Deno Language Server process.
        - **Vulnerability:** The malicious path retrieved by `getDenoCommandPath()` is directly used to execute a process, leading to arbitrary code execution.

    3. **`client/src/debug_config_provider.ts` - `DenoDebugConfigurationProvider.provideDebugConfigurations()` and `resolveDebugConfiguration()`:**
         ```typescript
         export class DenoDebugConfigurationProvider
           implements vscode.DebugConfigurationProvider {
           // ...
           async provideDebugConfigurations(): Promise<vscode.DebugConfiguration[]> {
             // ...
             const debugConfig: vscode.DebugConfiguration = {
               // ...
               runtimeExecutable: await getDenoCommandName(), // Gets deno command name, which uses getDenoCommandPath
               // ...
             };
             // ...
           }

           async resolveDebugConfiguration(
             workspace: vscode.WorkspaceFolder | undefined,
             config: vscode.DebugConfiguration,
           ): Promise<vscode.DebugConfiguration | null | undefined> {
             // ... similar usage of getDenoCommandName in case of missing config ...
           }
         }
         ```
         - `DenoDebugConfigurationProvider` also uses `getDenoCommandName()` (which internally calls `getDenoCommandPath()`) to determine the `runtimeExecutable` for debug configurations.
         - **Vulnerability:** Again, the potentially malicious path is used to execute a process when debugging.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Ensure you have a development environment set up for VSCode extension development (Node.js, VSCode, `vsce` CLI).
        - Have the VSCode Deno extension source code available locally.
    2. **Create Malicious Executable:**
        - Create a new file named `malicious-deno.sh` (or `malicious-deno.bat` for Windows) in a temporary directory (e.g., `/tmp` or `C:\temp`).
        - Add the following content to `malicious-deno.sh`:
            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "[VULNERABILITY TEST] Malicious Deno Executable Executed!"
            echo "[VULNERABILITY TEST] Current user: $(whoami)"
            # Optionally, perform a more harmful action for testing purposes, e.g., create a file:
            touch /tmp/vulnerability_test_success.txt
            exit 1 # Exit with an error code to simulate a broken Deno CLI if needed
            ```
        - For `malicious-deno.bat`:
            ```batch
            @echo off
            echo [VULNERABILITY TEST] Malicious Deno Executable Executed!
            echo "[VULNERABILITY TEST] Current user: %USERNAME%
            REM Optionally, perform a more harmful action for testing purposes, e.g., create a file:
            type nul > C:\temp\vulnerability_test_success.txt
            exit 1
            ```
        - Make the script executable: `chmod +x /tmp/malicious-deno.sh` (for Linux/macOS).
    3. **Create Malicious Workspace:**
        - Create a new empty directory to serve as your VSCode workspace (e.g., `test-workspace`).
        - Inside `test-workspace`, create a `.vscode` directory.
        - Inside `.vscode`, create a `settings.json` file.
        - Add the following JSON content to `settings.json`, adjusting the path to your malicious executable:
            ```json
            {
                "deno.path": "/tmp/malicious-deno.sh" // or "C:\\temp\\malicious-deno.bat" for Windows
            }
            ```
        - Create a dummy Deno file (e.g., `main.ts`) in the `test-workspace` root:
            ```typescript
            console.log("Hello, Deno!");
            ```
    4. **Test in VSCode:**
        - Open VSCode and open the `test-workspace` folder.
        - Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace (it might prompt you to enable it, click "Yes"). If not prompted, manually enable it using the "Deno: Enable" command.
        - Observe the VSCode output panel (or create a dedicated output channel for the Deno extension if needed for better visibility).
        - Trigger any Deno extension feature that uses the Deno CLI. For instance, try formatting `main.ts` (right-click in the editor, "Format Document With...", choose "Deno"). Or, simply wait for the language server to initialize, which often triggers Deno CLI execution.
    5. **Verification:**
        - Check the VSCode output panel. You should see the output from your malicious script, including "[VULNERABILITY TEST] Malicious Deno Executable Executed!" and the current user.
        - If you included the optional file creation command in your malicious script, check if the file `/tmp/vulnerability_test_success.txt` (or `C:\temp\vulnerability_test_success.txt` on Windows) was created.
        - This confirms that the malicious executable specified in `deno.path` was executed by the VSCode Deno extension, demonstrating the arbitrary code execution vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows for critical impact and requires immediate mitigation.
