## Vulnerability List for django-unicorn Project

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsafe HTML attributes in component templates

- **Vulnerability Name:**  Unsafe HTML Attributes in Templates leading to XSS
- **Description:**
    - An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by controlling data that is used to construct HTML attributes within a Django Unicorn component template.
    - Step 1: Identify a Django Unicorn component that uses user-controlled data to dynamically construct HTML attributes.
    - Step 2: Inject malicious JavaScript code into the user-controlled data. For example, if a component uses a variable `dynamic_attribute` in the template like `<div data-attribute="{{ dynamic_attribute }}">`, an attacker can set `dynamic_attribute` to `\` onclick="alert('XSS')\` `
    - Step 3: The template will render the HTML attribute without proper escaping, resulting in `<div data-attribute=" onclick="alert('XSS')" ">`.
    - Step 4: When a user interacts with the element (e.g., clicks on the div), the injected JavaScript code will execute in their browser, leading to XSS.
- **Impact:**
    - High. Successful XSS can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable web application. This can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, or information theft.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Django Unicorn attempts to HTML-encode updated field values by default to prevent XSS, as mentioned in changelog for v0.36.0.
    - The `safe` Meta option and `safe` template filter exist to explicitly allow unencoded values.
    - The `sanitize_html` function in `django_unicorn/utils.py` is used for HTML escaping in some contexts.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Django Unicorn does not automatically escape data rendered within HTML attributes by default. The current escaping mechanism primarily focuses on HTML tag content.
    - There is no clear documentation warning against using user-controlled data to construct HTML attributes dynamically without manual escaping.
- **Preconditions:**
    - A Django Unicorn component template must use user-controlled data to construct HTML attributes directly.
    - The developer must not be manually escaping the data used in HTML attributes.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The file `django_unicorn/utils.py` includes `sanitize_html` function, which is used to escape HTML content as seen in `test_sanitize_html` in `test_utils.py`. This function is likely applied to the content within HTML tags.
    - However, the provided files do not explicitly show that `sanitize_html` or similar escaping is automatically applied to data being injected into HTML attributes.
    - The test `test_safe_html_entities_not_encoded` in `test_process_component_request.py` confirms that using `safe` Meta option bypasses HTML encoding, which is expected and documented. However, it implicitly highlights that default behavior might not fully cover attribute context escaping.
    - The presence of `testing_thing` in `example/unicorn/components/text_inputs.py` and tests like `test_sanitize_html` in `test_utils.py` indicate awareness of XSS risks in general data handling, but the lack of specific attribute escaping in template rendering logic remains a vulnerability.
- **Security Test Case:**
    - Step 1: Create a Django Unicorn component with a property `attribute_value` and a template like this:
      ```html
      <div>
          <input unicorn:model="attribute_value" type="text">
          <div id="target" dynamic-attribute="{{ attribute_value }}">Test</div>
      </div>
      ```
    - Step 2: In the browser, navigate to a page with this component.
    - Step 3: In the input field, enter the following payload: `\` onclick="alert('XSS-attribute')\` `.
    - Step 4: Click anywhere on the page to trigger a component update (or use `lazy` modifier and blur the input).
    - Step 5: Inspect the rendered HTML source or use browser developer tools. Observe that the `div#target` now has the attribute: `dynamic-attribute=" onclick="alert('XSS-attribute')" "`.
    - Step 6: Click on the "Test" div. An alert box with "XSS-attribute" should appear, confirming the XSS vulnerability.

### 2. Potential Deserialization Vulnerability via Cached Components

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Deserialization of Untrusted Data in Cache
- **Description:**
    - Django Unicorn uses Django's caching framework to store component state, especially with the experimental serialization feature enabled.
    - If the cache backend is compromised or if there's a vulnerability in how cached data is managed, an attacker might be able to inject malicious serialized component data into the cache.
    - Step 1: Assume an attacker gains write access to the Django cache backend (this is a precondition, not directly triggerable via the application itself, but represents a realistic threat in case of infrastructure compromise or misconfiguration).
    - Step 2: Craft a malicious serialized component state. This would involve understanding the serialization format used by Django Unicorn (pickle based on `django_unicorn/cacher.py`) and creating a payload that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code or performs other malicious actions.
    - Step 3: Inject this malicious serialized data into the cache under a component cache key that will be accessed by the application.
    - Step 4: When the application attempts to restore the component from the cache using `restore_from_cache` in `django_unicorn/cacher.py`, the malicious serialized data will be deserialized, potentially leading to code execution or other security breaches.
- **Impact:**
    - High to Critical, depending on the nature of the malicious payload. Deserialization vulnerabilities can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to completely compromise the server.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Django Unicorn uses Django's cache framework, which itself is designed with some security considerations.
    - The experimental serialization feature is optional and disabled by default.
    - The documentation warns against using dummy caching in production for serialization, suggesting to use more robust backends like Redis or Memcached.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Django Unicorn could consider using a safer serialization format than pickle if feasible, although pickle is deeply integrated with Django's caching.
    - Implement integrity checks for cached component data, such as digital signatures, to detect tampering.
    - More explicit documentation warning about the security risks of deserialization vulnerabilities when using caching, especially with the experimental serialization feature, and recommendations for secure cache backend configurations.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The experimental serialization feature in Django Unicorn must be enabled (`UNICORN['SERIAL']['ENABLED'] = True`).
    - An attacker must be able to inject data into the Django cache backend. This is typically not directly achievable through the web application itself but could result from a compromised cache server, network interception (if cache communication is unencrypted), or vulnerabilities in the cache backend itself.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `django_unicorn/cacher.py` uses `pickle.dumps` and `pickle.loads` (implicitly via Django cache backend) for serialization and deserialization of components.
    - The `CacheableComponent` class and `cache_full_tree`, `restore_from_cache` functions in `django_unicorn/cacher.py` handle the caching mechanism.
    - While Django cache backends provide some level of isolation and security, deserialization of untrusted data using pickle is inherently risky.
    - The file `example/project/settings.py` shows that `UNICORN['SERIAL']['ENABLED'] = True` in the example project configuration, indicating that this feature, with its associated deserialization risk, is intended to be used and is not just a theoretical concern.
    - If an attacker can bypass cache access controls, pickle deserialization in `restore_from_cache` becomes a potential entry point for exploitation.
- **Security Test Case:**
    - _Note:_ This test case requires simulating cache compromise, which is outside the scope of typical web application testing. A full test would require setting up a test Django environment, enabling serialization, and then manually manipulating the cache backend data with a malicious serialized payload.
    - Step 1: Set up a Django Unicorn project with `UNICORN['SERIAL']['ENABLED'] = True` and a cache backend (e.g., locmem for testing, but ideally Redis/Memcached for real-world simulation).
    - Step 2: Run the application and trigger actions that cause components to be cached.
    - Step 3: Manually access the cache backend (e.g., using Redis CLI or Memcached tools).
    - Step 4: Identify a cached component key.
    - Step 5: Craft a malicious pickle payload that, when deserialized, will execute arbitrary code (e.g., using `__reduce__` method in Python classes). Serialize this payload using `pickle.dumps`.
    - Step 6: Replace the legitimate cached component data in the cache backend with the malicious pickle payload, using the identified key.
    - Step 7: In the application, trigger an action that would normally restore the component from the cache (e.g., refresh the page or perform an action that re-renders the component).
    - Step 8: Observe if the malicious code from the pickle payload is executed on the server. If it is, this confirms the deserialization vulnerability.
