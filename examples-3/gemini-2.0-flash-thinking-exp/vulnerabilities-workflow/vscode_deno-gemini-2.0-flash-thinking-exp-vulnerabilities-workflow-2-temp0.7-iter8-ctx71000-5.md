## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `deno.codeLens.testArgs`
- Description:
    1. An attacker can inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting in VSCode workspace or user settings.
    2. When a user executes a test using the "Run Test" code lens, the extension constructs a Deno CLI command.
    3. This command includes arguments from the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting, which are not properly sanitized.
    4. If a malicious command is injected into `deno.codeLens.testArgs`, it will be executed when the test is run.
    5. For example, setting `deno.codeLens.testArgs` to `["--allow-read", "; touch injected.txt &"]` will execute `touch injected.txt` in the system when a test code lens is used.
- Impact:
    - High. Arbitrary command execution on the user's system with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly uses the values from `deno.codeLens.testArgs` without any sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting. The extension should sanitize or validate the arguments provided in `deno.codeLens.testArgs` to prevent command injection.  Consider using parameterized commands or escaping shell metacharacters when constructing the Deno CLI command.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to modify the VSCode workspace or user settings, which can be achieved if the attacker can compromise the user's VSCode configuration or convince the user to apply malicious settings.
    - The user must execute a test using the "Run Test" code lens after the malicious setting is applied.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `client/src/commands.ts`
    2. Function: `test`
    3. Code Snippet:
        ```typescript
        const config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS, uri);
        const testArgs: string[] = [
          ...(config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs") ?? []),
        ];
        const unstable = config.get("unstable") as string[] ?? [];
        for (const unstableFeature of unstable) {
          const flag = `--unstable-${unstableFeature}`;
          if (!testArgs.includes(flag)) {
            testArgs.push(flag);
          }
        }
        // ... other args ...
        const args = ["test", ...testArgs, "--filter", nameRegex, filePath];
        ```
    4. Visualization:
        ```
        [User Settings/Workspace Settings] --> config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs") --> testArgs --> args --> vscode.ProcessExecution
        ```
    5. Explanation:
        - The `test` function retrieves the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting using `config.get<string[]>("codeLens.testArgs")`.
        - It directly spreads these arguments into the `testArgs` array without any sanitization.
        - The `testArgs` array is then used to construct the final arguments for the Deno CLI command in `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
        - If `deno.codeLens.testArgs` contains malicious commands, these commands will be executed by `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Open VSCode with the vscode-deno extension installed.
    2. Open a Deno project or create a simple Deno test file (e.g., `test.ts` with `Deno.test("test", () => {})`).
    3. Modify the workspace settings (or user settings) to set `deno.codeLens.testArgs` to `["--allow-read", "; touch injected_codelens_testargs.txt &"]`.
    4. Open the `test.ts` file in VSCode editor.
    5. Observe the "Run Test" code lens above the `Deno.test` definition.
    6. Click on "Run Test".
    7. Check the file system for a file named `injected_codelens_testargs.txt`. If the file exists, it indicates successful command injection.

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `deno.path`
- Description:
    1. An attacker can inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the `deno.path` setting in VSCode workspace or user settings.
    2. The `deno.path` setting specifies the path to the Deno executable.
    3. The extension uses this path to execute Deno CLI commands via `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
    4. If an attacker replaces the legitimate Deno executable path with a path to a malicious script, this script will be executed instead of Deno when the extension invokes Deno commands.
    5. For example, if `deno.path` is set to a malicious script that executes `touch injected_denopath.txt` and then calls the real Deno CLI, every Deno command executed by the extension will also trigger the creation of `injected_denopath.txt`.
- Impact:
    - Critical. Arbitrary command execution on the user's system with the privileges of the VSCode process, occurring on every invocation of the Deno CLI by the extension. This is a more severe vulnerability than `deno.codeLens.testArgs` because it affects all Deno commands, not just tests.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension only checks if the path exists as a file but does not validate or sanitize the path or its content.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Path validation and sanitization for `deno.path` setting. The extension should validate that the `deno.path` points to a legitimate Deno executable and potentially verify its integrity (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures). At a minimum, it should warn users if the `deno.path` is unusual or points to a location outside of standard installation directories.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to modify the VSCode workspace or user settings to change the `deno.path` setting to point to a malicious executable.
    - The user must have Deno extension enabled and the extension needs to invoke the Deno CLI (e.g., for formatting, linting, caching, testing, etc.).
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `client/src/util.ts`
    2. Function: `getDenoCommandPath`
    3. Code Snippet:
        ```typescript
        export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
          const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath();
          const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
          if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
            return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
          } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
            // ... relative path resolution ...
          } else {
            return command; // Directly returns user-provided path
          }
        }
        ```
    4. File: `client/src/commands.ts` (and other files using Deno CLI)
    5. Function: `startLanguageServer` (and others)
    6. Code Snippet:
        ```typescript
        const command = await getDenoCommandPath();
        const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
          run: {
            command, // User-controlled path used directly
            args: ["lsp"],
            options: { env },
          },
          // ... debug options ...
        };
        const client = new LanguageClient( ... serverOptions, ... );
        ```
    7. Visualization:
        ```
        [User Settings/Workspace Settings] --> deno.path --> getDenoCommandPath() --> command --> vscode.ProcessExecution
        ```
    8. Explanation:
        - `getDenoCommandPath` retrieves the `deno.path` setting from VSCode configuration.
        - If `deno.path` is an absolute path, it is directly returned without validation (beyond checking if it's a file that exists).
        - This path is then used as the `command` in `vscode.ProcessExecution` when starting the language server and executing other Deno CLI commands.
        - If `deno.path` is replaced with a malicious executable, that executable will be run instead of the real Deno CLI.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious script (e.g., `malicious_deno.sh` on Linux/macOS or `malicious_deno.bat` on Windows) that contains:
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        touch injected_denopath.txt
        /path/to/real/deno "$@" # Replace with the actual path to Deno CLI if needed, or just deno if in PATH
        ```
        or (for Windows `malicious_deno.bat`):
        ```batch
        @echo off
        echo touch injected_denopath.txt
        type nul > injected_denopath.txt
        deno %* # Assuming deno is in PATH, otherwise use full path to real deno.exe
        ```
    2. Make the script executable (`chmod +x malicious_deno.sh`).
    3. In VSCode settings (user or workspace), set `deno.path` to the absolute path of the malicious script (e.g., `"/path/to/malicious_deno.sh"` or `"C:\\path\\to\\malicious_deno.bat"`).
    4. Open a Deno project or any file that triggers the Deno extension to start (e.g., a `.ts` file).
    5. Wait for the Deno extension to activate and potentially perform any action that invokes the Deno CLI (like formatting a file, running a test, or caching dependencies).
    6. Check the file system for a file named `injected_denopath.txt`. If the file exists, it indicates successful command injection via `deno.path`.
