- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in AI-Generated Code
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious input image. This image is designed to visually represent a webpage, but also subtly incorporates text or visual cues that will mislead the AI model into generating HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code containing XSS vulnerabilities. Examples of such malicious inputs include visual representations of HTML tags like `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` or JavaScript code snippets like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
    2. The user uploads this crafted malicious image to the `screenshot-to-code` application via the frontend interface.
    3. The frontend sends the image to the backend for processing.
    4. The backend, upon receiving the image, forwards it to a configured AI model (e.g., GPT-4 Vision, Claude) for code generation, based on the project's configuration (files like `backend/llm.py`, `backend/config.py`).
    5. The AI model, interpreting the malicious cues in the input image, generates code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that unintentionally or intentionally includes XSS vulnerabilities. This could manifest as unsanitized user input reflection in HTML, or the inclusion of malicious JavaScript code.
    6. The backend streams the AI-generated code back to the frontend without any sanitization or security review.
    7. The frontend presents this generated code to the user, allowing them to preview or download it for deployment.
    8. If the user proceeds to deploy or preview the AI-generated code in a web browser environment, the embedded XSS vulnerabilities become exploitable. For instance, if the generated code contains JavaScript `alert('XSS')` or similar malicious scripts, they will execute in the user's browser.
- Impact:
    If a user deploys the AI-generated code that contains XSS vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to:
    - Steal sensitive user information, such as cookies, session tokens, and potentially credentials, leading to account hijacking and unauthorized access.
    - Deface the web page, altering content and potentially damaging the reputation or functionality of the deployed application.
    - Redirect users to attacker-controlled malicious websites, potentially for phishing attacks or malware distribution.
    - Inject malware or initiate other malicious actions on the user's browser or system.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user without their consent, if the deployed code interacts with authenticated services.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. Analysis of the provided project files, including `backend/routes/evals.py`, `backend/routes/generate_code.py`, `backend/routes/home.py`, `backend/routes/screenshot.py`, `backend/video/utils.py`, and `backend/ws/constants.py`, indicates no implemented mitigations to sanitize or review the AI-generated code for potential XSS vulnerabilities. The application focuses on functionality and code generation accuracy rather than security of the output.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Output Sanitization**: Implement robust sanitization of the AI-generated code on the backend before it is presented to the user. This should include:
        - HTML Sanitization: Parsing and cleaning HTML code to remove or neutralize potentially harmful tags and attributes (e.g., `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `onerror`, `onload`, `javascript:` URLs). Libraries like DOMPurify (for JavaScript) or equivalent backend libraries should be used to ensure effective sanitization.
        - JavaScript Sanitization: Analyzing and potentially rewriting or removing JavaScript code that could be malicious. This is a more complex task, and may require sandboxing or static analysis tools.
        - CSS Sanitization: Reviewing and sanitizing CSS to prevent CSS-based attacks (though less common for XSS, still a good practice).
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement CSP headers in the frontend application, especially when previewing the generated code. CSP can restrict the capabilities of the generated code within the preview environment, limiting the impact of potential XSS. For example, CSP can be configured to disallow inline scripts or restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
    - **User Warnings and Security Guidance**: Display clear and prominent warnings to users about the inherent security risks of deploying AI-generated code. Advise users to:
        - Manually review and sanitize the generated code before deployment.
        - Understand that AI-generated code may contain vulnerabilities.
        - Follow secure coding practices when using the generated code.
        - Consider security testing of the generated applications.
        This warning should be displayed in the frontend UI, especially when previewing or downloading code, and in project documentation (e.g., README, troubleshooting guides).
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to craft a malicious image that can successfully induce the AI model to generate code with XSS vulnerabilities. The effectiveness of this attack depends on the AI model's training data, biases, and prompt engineering.
    - A user must utilize the `screenshot-to-code` application to process this malicious image, thereby generating the vulnerable code.
    - The user must then preview or deploy the generated code in an environment (e.g., a web browser, a web server) where the XSS vulnerability can be triggered and exploited.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **`backend/routes/generate_code.py`**: This file handles the code generation process via a websocket endpoint (`/generate-code`). It receives input parameters, including the image, stack, and API keys, and orchestrates the interaction with LLMs (via `llm.py`) to generate code. The generated code, after being extracted by `extract_html_content` from `codegen/utils.py`, is directly sent back to the frontend through the websocket without any sanitization. The function `stream_code` in this file is the primary entry point for code generation and lacks any security measures to prevent XSS. It directly streams chunks of code from the LLM to the client.
    - **`backend/llm.py`**: (Previously analyzed) Manages interactions with different LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini). It streams responses back but does not perform any sanitization.
    - **`backend/codegen/utils.py`**: (Previously analyzed) Contains `extract_html_content` which extracts HTML code blocks using regular expressions but performs no sanitization.
    - **`backend/video/utils.py`**: This file is relevant as it processes video inputs, converting them into screenshots to be fed to the AI model. The `assemble_claude_prompt_video` function prepares image data from video frames for the LLM. This expands the attack surface to video inputs, but the core vulnerability remains the same: if a malicious visual representation of XSS is present in the video frames (or still images), the AI can generate vulnerable code, and there's no sanitization in place.
    - **`backend/routes/evals.py`, `backend/routes/home.py`, `backend/routes/screenshot.py`, `backend/ws/constants.py`**: These files do not directly participate in the code generation and response pipeline in a way that would introduce new vulnerabilities or mitigations related to XSS in AI-generated code. `evals.py` is for internal evaluations, `home.py` is a basic status endpoint, `screenshot.py` handles taking website screenshots (which could be another input source but relies on external service), and `ws/constants.py` defines websocket related constants.
    - **Absence of Sanitization Libraries**: As previously confirmed, there are no HTML/JavaScript sanitization libraries included in the project dependencies, further reinforcing the lack of output sanitization.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare Test Environment**: Set up a local instance of the `screenshot-to-code` application by following the instructions in `README.md`. Ensure both frontend and backend are running and accessible via `http://localhost:5173`.
    2. **Craft a Malicious Image**: Create a PNG image file (e.g., `xss_image.png`). Use an image editor or a simple drawing tool. Within the image, visually represent a basic webpage structure. Subtly embed an XSS payload as part of the visual content. For example, within the image of what looks like a heading or paragraph text, include the raw HTML for an XSS payload like `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS Vulnerability!')>`. The goal is to make this payload visually part of the webpage screenshot so the AI interprets it as code to be generated.
    3. **Upload Malicious Image**: Open the `screenshot-to-code` frontend in a web browser (`http://localhost:5173`). Use the application's image upload functionality to upload the crafted `xss_image.png`.
    4. **Select Stack and Generate Code**: Choose any supported stack (e.g., "HTML + Tailwind") in the application's interface. Initiate the code generation process by clicking the "Generate Code" or similar button.
    5. **Inspect Generated Code**: Once the code generation is complete, carefully review the output code displayed in the application's frontend. Look for the XSS payload that was visually represented in the input image. Verify if the AI has generated HTML code that includes the raw `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS Vulnerability!')>` tag or a similar JavaScript-based XSS attack vector.
    6. **Preview Generated Code**: Use the application's preview feature (if available) to render the generated code within the browser. Alternatively, copy the generated HTML code, save it to a new HTML file (e.g., `test_xss.html`), and open this file directly in a web browser.
    7. **Verify XSS Execution**: Check if the XSS payload executes when the generated code is rendered in the browser. In this example, you should expect to see an alert dialog box pop up displaying "XSS Vulnerability!". If the alert appears, it confirms that the AI has generated code with an XSS vulnerability based on the malicious input image, and that the application did not prevent this.
