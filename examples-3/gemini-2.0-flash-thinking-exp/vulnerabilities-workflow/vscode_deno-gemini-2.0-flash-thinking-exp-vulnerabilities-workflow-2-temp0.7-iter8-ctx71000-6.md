- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Deno Executable Path Execution

- Description:
    1.  An attacker can create a malicious project.
    2.  Inside this project, the attacker crafts a `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    3.  In the `.vscode/settings.json`, the attacker sets the `deno.path` setting to point to a malicious executable, either within the project or on a network share accessible to the user. For example, `"/path/to/malicious.sh"` or `"\\\\evil-server\\share\\malicious.exe"`.
    4.  The user opens this malicious project in Visual Studio Code and activates the Deno extension.
    5.  When the Deno extension starts, it reads the `deno.path` setting from `.vscode/settings.json`.
    6.  The extension then attempts to execute the specified path as the Deno executable.
    7.  If the path points to a malicious executable, it will be executed with the privileges of the user running VSCode.

- Impact:
    - Critical: Arbitrary code execution. If an attacker can trick a user into opening a malicious project, they can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine with the user's privileges. This could lead to complete compromise of the user's system, including data theft, malware installation, and further propagation of attacks.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code directly uses the path provided in `deno.path` setting without any validation or sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Path validation: The extension should validate the `deno.path` setting to ensure it points to a legitimate Deno executable and not a potentially malicious script or program. This could include:
        - Checking if the path is an absolute path.
        - Checking if the file extension is a known executable extension (e.g., `.exe` on Windows, no extension or execution bits set on Linux/macOS).
        - Whitelisting known safe directories for Deno executables, or blacklisting suspicious directories.
        - Using OS-specific APIs to verify that the executable is indeed a Deno executable (though this might be complex).
    - User confirmation: Before executing a Deno executable from a `deno.path` setting, especially if it's a workspace setting, the extension could prompt the user to confirm if they trust the executable path.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the Deno extension installed in Visual Studio Code.
    - The user must open a malicious project in Visual Studio Code.
    - The malicious project must contain a `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets the `deno.path` setting to a malicious executable.
    - The user must activate the Deno extension in the malicious project (either explicitly enabling it or implicitly by having a `deno.json` file in the project root).

- Source Code Analysis:
    1.  `client\src\util.ts`: The `getDenoCommandPath()` function retrieves the `deno.path` setting from workspace configuration using `getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath()`.

    ```typescript
    // File: ..\vscode_deno\client\src\util.ts
    export async function getDenoCommandPath() {
      const command = getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath(); // Get deno.path from config
      const workspaceFolders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
      if (!command || !workspaceFolders) {
        return command ?? await getDefaultDenoCommand();
      } else if (!path.isAbsolute(command)) {
        // ... (relative path resolution logic) ...
      } else {
        return command; // Directly return user-provided path without validation
      }
    }

    function getWorkspaceConfigDenoExePath() {
      const exePath = workspace.getConfiguration(EXTENSION_NS)
        .get<string>("path"); // Retrieve "deno.path" setting
      // ...
      return exePath;
    }
    ```

    2.  `client\src\commands.ts`: The `startLanguageServer()` function calls `getDenoCommandPath()` to get the executable path and uses it to spawn the Language Server Process.

    ```typescript
    // File: ..\vscode_deno\client\src\commands.ts
    export function startLanguageServer(
      context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
      extensionContext: DenoExtensionContext,
    ): Callback {
      return async () => {
        // ...
        const command = await getDenoCommandPath(); // Get deno command path
        if (command == null) {
          // ... error handling ...
          return;
        }

        const serverOptions: ServerOptions = {
          run: {
            command, // Use the path directly as command
            args: ["lsp"],
            options: { env },
          },
          debug: {
            command, // Use the path directly as command
            args: ["lsp"],
            options: { env },
          },
        };
        // ... create and start LanguageClient ...
      }
    }
    ```

            C --> D{vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("deno").get("path")};
            D -- deno.path setting --> E[Return user provided path];
            B -- Path from deno.path --> F[Return path to startLanguageServer()];
            A -- Command Path --> G[LanguageClient: spawn process];
            G -- Execute path as Deno CLI --> H[Malicious Executable Execution];

    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1.  **Setup:**
        - Create a new directory named `malicious-deno-project`.
        - Inside `malicious-deno-project`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
        - Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
          ```json
          {
              "deno.path": "./malicious.sh"
          }
          ```
        - In the root of `malicious-deno-project`, create a file named `malicious.sh` (or `malicious.bat` on Windows) with the following content:
          ```bash
          #!/bin/bash
          echo "Malicious script executed!" > malicious_output.txt
          # Add more malicious commands here, e.g., reverse shell, data exfiltration
          ```
          (For Windows `malicious.bat`):
          ```batch
          @echo off
          echo Malicious script executed! > malicious_output.txt
          :: Add more malicious commands here
          ```
        - Make `malicious.sh` executable (`chmod +x malicious.sh`).
        - Create a dummy Deno file, e.g., `main.ts` in `malicious-deno-project` to trigger extension activation if auto-enable on project is active.
        - Open the `malicious-deno-project` directory in Visual Studio Code.
    2.  **Execution:**
        - Ensure the Deno extension is activated for this workspace. You might need to enable Deno for the workspace if it's not automatically enabled.
        - Observe the output.
    3.  **Verification:**
        - Check if the `malicious_output.txt` file has been created in the `malicious-deno-project` directory and contains the message "Malicious script executed!".
        - If successful, this confirms that the malicious script specified in `deno.path` was executed by the extension.
