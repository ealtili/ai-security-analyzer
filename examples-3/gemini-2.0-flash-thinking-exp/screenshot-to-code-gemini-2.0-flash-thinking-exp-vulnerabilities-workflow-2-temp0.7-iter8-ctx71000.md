## Combined Vulnerability List

### 1. Image Processing Vulnerability via PIL

* Description:
    1. An attacker uploads a maliciously crafted image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG) to the application.
    2. The backend application, specifically the `process_image` function in `backend/image_processing/utils.py`, uses the Pillow (PIL) library to process the uploaded image. This processing includes resizing, format conversion (to JPEG), and quality reduction. For video uploads, similar processing may occur on extracted frames from video files using PIL.
    3. A vulnerability exists if the malicious image is crafted to exploit a parsing or processing flaw within the Pillow library itself. For example, a specially crafted PNG file could trigger a buffer overflow, integer overflow, memory corruption vulnerabilities, or even arbitrary file read when Pillow attempts to decode or manipulate it.
    4. If exploited, this could lead to arbitrary code execution on the backend server or arbitrary file read, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server, read sensitive data, or perform other malicious actions.

* Impact:
    - **Critical**. Arbitrary code execution on the backend server or **High** Arbitrary file read. This allows the attacker to completely compromise the server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, further attacks on users or infrastructure, or read sensitive files from the server's filesystem, such as configuration files, source code, or other application data.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical (for code execution) / High (for file read)

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Resizing and Re-encoding**: The `process_image` function resizes and re-encodes images to JPEG, which can sometimes mitigate certain types of image-based attacks by normalizing the image data.
    - **Size and Dimension Limits for Claude API**: The application enforces size and dimension limits to comply with Claude API requirements.

    *Code Snippet from `backend/image_processing/utils.py`:*
    ```python
    from PIL import Image
    import io
    import base64

    def process_image(image_data_url: str) -> tuple[str, str]:
        # ...
        img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes)) # Vulnerable line
        # ...
        img.save(output, format="JPEG", quality=quality)
        # ...
        return ("image/jpeg", base64.b64encode(output.getvalue()).decode("utf-8"))
    ```

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Lack of robust validation of image file headers and content before processing with PIL.
    - **Security Scanning of PIL**: The project dependencies, including Pillow, should be regularly scanned for known vulnerabilities.
    - **Sandboxing/Isolation**: Running the image processing in a sandboxed environment or isolated process.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: While CSP is frontend-focused, a strict CSP could help mitigate the impact of XSS if arbitrary code execution is leveraged to inject malicious scripts into the generated code.

* Preconditions:
    - The application must be running and accessible to the attacker.
    - The attacker needs to be able to upload an image file to the application.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`backend/llm.py` -> `stream_claude_response`**: This function handles Claude API calls and image processing for Claude models.
    2. **`stream_claude_response` calls `process_image` from `backend/image_processing/utils.py`**:
       ```python
       (media_type, base64_data) = process_image(image_data_url)
       ```
    3. **`backend/image_processing/utils.py` -> `process_image`**:
       ```python
       img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes))
       ```

    5. **Monitor Backend Server**: Observe the backend server for signs of exploitation: crashes, errors, or code execution indicators.
    6. **Analyze Logs and System State**: Examine logs for errors, crashes, or suspicious activity.

### 2. Video Processing Vulnerability via PIL and MoviePy

* Description:
    1. An attacker uploads a maliciously crafted video file to the application.
    2. The backend application, specifically the `split_video_into_screenshots` function in `backend/video/utils.py`, uses the MoviePy library to decode the video and extract frames. Subsequently, it uses the Pillow (PIL) library to process these extracted frames.
    3. Vulnerabilities can arise from MoviePy's video decoding (potentially through underlying libraries like FFmpeg) or from PIL's processing of extracted frames. A crafted video file could exploit vulnerabilities during video decoding, frame extraction, or when PIL processes these frames, leading to issues similar to image processing vulnerabilities.
    4. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the backend server or arbitrary file read.

* Impact:
    - **Critical**. Arbitrary code execution on the backend server, or **High** Arbitrary file read, similar to the image processing vulnerability.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical (for code execution) / High (for file read)

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Frame Limit**: The `TARGET_NUM_SCREENSHOTS` constant limits the number of frames processed.
    - **JPEG Conversion**: Converting video frames to JPEG using PIL.

    *Code Snippets from `backend/video/utils.py`:*
    ```python
    from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip
    from PIL import Image
    import io
    import base64

    def split_video_into_screenshots(video_data_url: str) -> list[Image.Image]:
        # ...
        clip = VideoFileClip(temp_video_file.name) # Potential MoviePy vulnerability
        # ...
        for i, frame in enumerate(clip.iter_frames()):
            # ...
            frame_image = Image.fromarray(frame)  # type: ignore # Potential PIL vulnerability when creating image from frame
            images.append(frame_image)
            # ...
        clip.close()
        return images
    ```

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Lack of validation for video file headers and content before processing with MoviePy and PIL.
    - **Security Scanning of MoviePy and PIL**: Dependencies like MoviePy, FFmpeg, and Pillow should be regularly scanned for known vulnerabilities.
    - **Sandboxing/Isolation**: Running the video and image processing in sandboxed environments or isolated processes.
    - **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for video uploads.

* Preconditions:
    - The application must be running and accessible to the attacker.
    - The application must support video uploads as an input mode.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`backend/routes/generate_code.py` -> `stream_code`**: Handles video input mode.
    2. **`stream_code` calls `create_prompt`**.
    3. **`prompts/create_prompt.py` -> `create_prompt`**: Calls video prompt assembly functions for video input.
    4. **`backend/video/utils.py` -> `assemble_claude_prompt_video`**: Calls `split_video_into_screenshots`.
    5. **`backend/video/utils.py` -> `split_video_into_screenshots`**:
       ```python
       clip = VideoFileClip(temp_video_file.name) # MoviePy video loading
       # ...
       frame_image = Image.fromarray(frame)  # PIL image creation from frame
       images.append(frame_image)
       ```

    2. **Set up the Application**: Ensure the application is running and accessible.
    3. **Access the Application Interface**: Open the web application in a browser and navigate to the video upload functionality.
    4. **Upload Malicious Video**: Upload the crafted malicious video file.
    5. **Monitor Backend Server**: Observe the backend server for signs of exploitation.
    6. **Analyze Logs and System State**: Examine backend and system logs for errors or suspicious activity.

### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability via AI-Generated Code and Prompt Injection

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious input such as a screenshot, mockup, or video frame, or even a URL for screenshotting. This input is designed to inject malicious instructions or code into the code generation process.
    2. The user uploads this malicious input to the application.
    3. The backend processes the input and uses it to construct a prompt for the AI model. Critically, the content of the user-provided input is included in the prompt without sanitization.
    4. The AI model, interpreting the malicious instructions or code embedded in the input as part of the design requirements, generates code that includes the attacker's injected payload, such as JavaScript code or other potentially harmful content.
    5. The backend sends this AI-generated code, containing the malicious payload, to the frontend.
    6. The frontend, without proper sanitization, renders this AI-generated code in the user's browser. This can occur when displaying the generated code to the user within the application itself, or if the user deploys the generated code into their own web application.
    7. When a user views the generated code within the application or implements it in their own application, the malicious JavaScript code is executed in their browser, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

* Impact:
    - **High**. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Consequences of XSS can include:
        - **Account Hijacking**: Stealing session cookies or authentication tokens.
        - **Credential Theft**: Capturing user login credentials.
        - **Data Theft**: Exfiltrating sensitive data.
        - **Website Defacement**: Modifying website content.
        - **Redirection to Malicious Sites**: Redirecting users to phishing or malware sites.
        - **Malware Distribution**: Spreading malware to website visitors.
        - **Client-Side Code Manipulation**: Altering the intended functionality of the generated code.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. There are no explicit mitigations in the provided project files to prevent prompt injection or XSS in the AI-generated code. The application directly uses user inputs to construct prompts and renders AI-generated code without sanitization.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization/Validation**: Implement robust input sanitization and validation on uploaded screenshots, mockups, and video frames.
    - **Prompt Engineering for Security**: Refine prompts to minimize prompt injection risks by separating user content from system instructions.
    - **Output Sanitization**: Implement sanitization of the generated code before presenting it to the user. Use HTML sanitization libraries to remove or neutralize potentially malicious code, especially JavaScript.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a strict CSP to reduce the risk of XSS.
    - **User Awareness and Education**: Educate users about prompt injection risks and advise them to review generated code carefully.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to craft a malicious screenshot, mockup, or video, or identify a vulnerable URL for screenshotting.
    - The user must upload this malicious input to the application.
    - The application must generate code based on the input.
    - The frontend must render the generated code without sanitization.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`backend/routes/generate_code.py` (WebSocket Entry Point)**: Receives user input including image/video data.
    2. **`prompts/__init__.py` (Prompt Assembly)**: `assemble_prompt` directly embeds `image_data_url` into the prompt without sanitization.
    3. **`video/utils.py` (Video Frame Extraction)**: Processes video inputs, extracts frames, and uses them similarly to image uploads.
    4. **`llm.py` (LLM Interaction)**: Sends prompts with unsanitized image/video frame content to LLMs.
    5. **`codegen/utils.py`**: `extract_html_content` extracts HTML but does not sanitize it.
    6. **Frontend Rendering**: Assumed to render received HTML directly without sanitization.

    [Malicious Code Generated by LLM] --> [Backend] --> [Frontend (WebSocket)] --> [User Receives Malicious Code & Renders it - XSS]
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a Malicious Screenshot/Mockup/Video**: Craft an input containing malicious JavaScript (e.g., `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>`).
    2. **Access the Application**: Open the application in a browser.
    3. **Upload the Malicious Input**: Use the application's UI to upload the crafted input.
    4. **Select Stack and Generate Code**: Choose any stack and generate code.
    5. **Review Generated Code**: Examine the generated code for injected JavaScript.
    6. **Verify Malicious Code Injection**: Check if the injected JavaScript is in the generated code.
    7. **Execute Generated Code (Impact Confirmation)**: Copy the generated code, create an HTML file, paste the code, and open it in a browser to verify XSS execution.

### 4. Unprotected Backend API Endpoint - Image/Video to Code Conversion

* Description:
    The backend API endpoint responsible for converting images and videos to code lacks authentication and authorization mechanisms. This allows any external user to send requests to this endpoint, providing an image or video and triggering the AI code conversion process without any form of access control.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. Identify the backend API WebSocket endpoint `/generate-code`.
    2. Establish a WebSocket connection to this endpoint.
    3. Send a JSON payload with parameters for code generation, including image or video data.
    4. The backend server processes the request and returns generated code without authentication.

* Impact:
    - **High**.
        - **Abuse of AI API Credits:** Unauthorized users can consume application owner's AI API credits, leading to unexpected financial costs.
        - **Resource Exhaustion:** Overload the backend server and AI APIs, causing performance degradation or service unavailability.
        - **Denial of Service (Resource based):** Resource abuse can lead to economic or temporary DoS.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. No authentication or authorization checks are implemented for the `/generate-code` WebSocket endpoint.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Authentication**: Implement authentication for the `/generate-code` endpoint.
    - **Authorization**: Implement authorization to control access to the code generation feature.
    - **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on the `/generate-code` endpoint.
    - **Usage Quotas**: Consider usage quotas to limit AI API credit consumption.

* Preconditions:
    - The backend WebSocket endpoint `/generate-code` must be publicly accessible.
    - The attacker needs to know the WebSocket endpoint URL and message format.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`backend/routes/generate_code.py`**: Defines the `/generate-code` WebSocket endpoint.
    2. **`stream_code` function**: Processes incoming WebSocket messages directly without authentication or authorization checks.
    3. **Absence of Security Measures**: No middleware, decorators, or code for authentication or authorization on API endpoints.

    *Code Snippet from `backend/routes/generate_code.py`:*
    ```python
    @router.websocket("/generate-code")
    async def stream_code(websocket: WebSocket):
        await websocket.accept()
        print("Incoming websocket connection...")
        params: dict[str, str] = await websocket.receive_json() # Receives parameters directly without authentication
        # ... [Code generation logic] ...
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites**: Running backend instance, image/video file, WebSocket client.
    2. **Steps**:
        a. Identify WebSocket URL (`ws://<backend-host>:<backend-port>/generate-code`).
        b. Establish WebSocket connection.
        c. Construct and send JSON message with image/video data and parameters.
        d. Observe server responses over WebSocket.
    3. **Expected Result**: Code generation starts and code is returned without authentication.
    4. **Success Condition**: Receiving generated code without authentication confirms vulnerability.
