      You are cybersecurity expert, working with development team that is building application described in PROJECT FILES. Your task is to create mitigation strategies for application described in PROJECT FILES. Focus on mitigation strategies for threats introduced by application in PROJECT FILES and omit general, common mitigation strategies.

      Create mitigation strategies list with: mitigation strategy, description (describe in details step by step how can developers or users reduce the risk), list of threats mitigated (describe what threats are mitigated and what is their severity), impact (describe the impact of the mitigation strategy - how much risk is reduced for each threat), currently implemented (describe if this mitigation strategy is currently implemented in the project and where), missing implementation (describe where this mitigation strategy is missing in the project).

      - When the `CURRENT MITIGATION STRATEGIES` is not empty, it indicates that a draft of this document was created in previous interactions using earlier batches of `PROJECT FILES`. In this case, integrate new findings from the current `PROJECT FILES` into the existing `CURRENT MITIGATION STRATEGIES`. Ensure consistency and avoid duplication.

      - If the `CURRENT MITIGATION STRATEGIES` is empty, proceed to create a new threat model based on the current `PROJECT FILES`.

      Use valid markdown formatting.
