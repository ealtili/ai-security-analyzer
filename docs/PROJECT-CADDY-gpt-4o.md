# Project Design Document - Caddy Server Reverse Proxy (Updated)

## Business Posture

**Business Priorities and Goals:**
1. Provide a flexible reverse proxy mechanism for distributing incoming client requests across multiple backend services.
2. Support dynamic, round-robin, and weight-based load balancing to ensure efficient resource utilization.
3. Facilitate easy integration with backend applications through minimal configuration efforts and compatibility with multiple protocols.
4. Offer internal certificate authority (CA) functionalities via PKI module for seamless internal certification management and ACME server support.

**Business Risks:**
1. Configuration errors or suboptimal proxy strategies could lead to service downtime or reduced performance.
2. Complex interaction with multiple backend services may introduce integration challenges.
3. Evolving security standards demand regular updates and compliance checks.
4. Improper certificate lifecycle management could lead to security vulnerabilities.

## Security Posture

**Existing Security Controls:**
- Security Control: Structured configuration and input handling in Caddyfile and Go structuring - Observed in `caddyfile.go` files for different modules.
- Security Control: Context map to retain request tracing across proxies and handlers - Implemented in `tracer.go`.
- Security Control: Response compression and transfer encoding to optimize client-server communications - Managed in `net/http/httputil`.
- Security Control: Graceful degradation and retries for fast failover and resilience during service outages.
- Security Control: Enforced safe operation mode for template execution preventing command execution - Managed using `template/escape` package.
- Security Control: PKI Management with functionalities to handle internal certificate authorities, root, and intermediate certificates - Implemented in `caddypki/*.go`.
- Security Control: ACME server handler to manage certificate issuing through ACME challenges - Implemented in `acmeserver/acmeserver.go`.
- Security Control: On-Demand TLS certificate management to handle certificate requests at handshake time - Implemented in `ondemand.go`.
- Security Control: PEM Loader to handle certificate loading without persistent storage - Implemented in `pemloader.go`.
- Security Control: Session Ticket Service for managing TLS session tickets to enable session resumption - Implemented in `sessiontickets.go`.

**Accepted Risks:**
- Accepted Risk: Third-party module reliance might result in varied update cycles and delayed security patches.

**Recommended Security Controls:**
- Recommended Control: Implementation of timeout and circuit-breaker mechanisms to manage long-standing or unresponsive backend connections.
- Recommended Control: Incorporating validation checks for upstream hosts to prevent common vulnerabilities such as host header attacks.
- Recommended Control: Employing rate-limiting mechanisms on client requests to prevent denial of service scenarios.

**Security Requirements:**
- Authentication: Usage of OAuth or similar token-based mechanics for secured proxy service requests with third-party systems.
- Authorization: Dynamic route mappings should authorize known host-protocol pairs.
- Input Validation: Confirm incoming requests conform to expected URI and parameter structures.
- Cryptography: Derivative of TLS for communicating with secure backends leveraging mutual TLS where applicable.

### Build

**Build Process:**
- **Developer**: Submits code to VCS.
- **CI/CD Flow**: Initiated upon code commit, triggering automated pipelines.
- **Validation**: Builds execute tests, checks, static and dynamic analysis.
- **Artifact**: Successful builds dispatched to centralized repository.

```mermaid

    code_commit --> repository(GitHub)
    repository --> ci_system(CI/CD Pipeline)

```

**Build Security Controls:**
- Application of automated audits including SAST.
- Multi-stage builds limit exposure during Docker publication.
- Hardened CI configurations extend protection against supply chain attacks.

## Risk Assessment

- **Critical Business Processes**: Secure routing of client requests to provide uninterrupted content delivery to end-users, requiring robust failure and resilience management.
- **Data Protection Goals**: Encrypt user communication, whereas sensitive configuration variables should be encrypted in material stores.

## Questions & Assumptions

- **Questions**:
  1. Are user connections typically short-lived, or do they require session persistence?
  2. What is the throughput each backend can effectively handle, and how is it horizontally managed?
  3. Are there specific legal compliance (e.g., GDPR) considerations for logging and monitoring activities?

- **Assumptions**:
  - Backend services behind the proxy are secured independently with compliant measurement standards.
  - Failover strategies are configured properly to handle downtime scenarios, ensuring high availability.
  - Users will primarily access through public cloud services, suggesting incoming traffic from multiple regions.
