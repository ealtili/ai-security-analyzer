# BUSINESS POSTURE

The "AI Create Project Security Design" project aims to automate the creation of comprehensive security design documents using AI language models. The primary business priorities and goals are:

- **Efficiency**: Streamline the process of generating security design documents to save time and resources.
- **Consistency**: Ensure that all security designs adhere to industry standards and best practices.
- **Accessibility**: Make security design processes accessible to organizations lacking extensive security expertise.
- **Scalability**: Enable rapid generation of security designs for multiple or large-scale projects.

Key business risks that need to be addressed include:

- **Reliance on AI Accuracy**: Dependence on AI-generated content may result in oversight of critical security issues.
- **Compliance Risks**: Generated documents may not fully comply with specific regulatory requirements or industry standards.
- **Data Privacy Concerns**: Processing sensitive project data with AI services could expose confidential information.
- **Adoption Resistance**: Potential skepticism from stakeholders regarding the reliability of AI-generated security designs.

# SECURITY POSTURE

**Existing Security Controls:**

- **Security Control**: Utilization of Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines via GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment (evident in `/app/README.md` and `/app/.github/workflows/ci.yaml`).
- **Security Control**: Implementation of code quality and security checks using tools such as `pytest` for testing, `mypy` for type checking, `ruff` for linting, and `bandit` for security scanning (configured in `/app/pyproject.toml`).
- **Security Control**: Management of dependencies with `poetry`, ensuring consistent and reproducible builds (as seen in `pyproject.toml` and `/app/build.sh`).
- **Security Control**: Exclusion of sensitive files and directories from processing to prevent unauthorized access (handled in `/app/ai_create_project_sec_design/loaders.py`).

**Accepted Risks:**

- **Accepted Risk**: Potential for AI models to produce incomplete or incorrect security designs due to limitations in training data or context understanding.
- **Accepted Risk**: Dependency on third-party services (AI providers) which may have their own vulnerabilities or change their API terms.

**Recommended Security Controls:**

- **Security Control**: Implement dependency vulnerability scanning using tools like `Safety` or `Dependabot` to detect and remediate vulnerable packages.
- **Security Control**: Enforce secure storage and rotation of API keys and secrets, possibly integrating with vault services (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
- **Security Control**: Introduce manual review steps for AI-generated documents by security professionals to validate accuracy and compliance.
- **Security Control**: Employ network security measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems if deploying as a web service.

**Security Requirements:**

- **Authentication**: Secure handling and storage of API keys for AI service providers (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `/app/ai_create_project_sec_design/constants.py`).
- **Authorization**: Restrict tool usage to authorized users; implement role-based access controls if necessary.
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs and project files to prevent injection attacks and processing of malicious code.
- **Cryptography**: Use encryption for data in transit (TLS/HTTPS) when communicating with AI services and encrypt sensitive data at rest if stored locally.

# DESIGN

The "AI Create Project Security Design" tool is designed to process project files, interact with AI language models, and generate security design documents. The application is developed in Python and leverages several modules to achieve its functionality.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

**Critical Business Processes to Protect:**

- **Security Design Generation**: Ensuring the tool generates accurate and comprehensive security designs.
- **Data Integrity and Confidentiality**: Protecting sensitive project data during processing and transmission.
- **Service Availability**: Maintaining uptime of the tool, especially if provided as a service.

**Data to Protect and Sensitivity:**

- **Project Source Code**: May contain proprietary or confidential information.
- **API Keys and Credentials**: Sensitive information that grants access to external services.
- **Generated Security Documents**: Could reveal internal architecture and vulnerabilities if exposed.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

**Questions:**

1. What measures are in place to secure API keys and prevent unauthorized access?
2. Are there policies for data retention and deletion, especially regarding sensitive project files?
3. How does the tool handle projects with large codebases that may exceed API limitations?
4. What fallback mechanisms exist if AI service providers are unavailable or return errors?
5. Is there a review process for AI-generated content before it's accepted or merged into the repository?

**Assumptions:**

- The tool is intended for use within controlled environments by trusted users.
- All communications with AI service providers are encrypted and secured.
- Users have the necessary permissions and rights to process the project files with third-party services.
- The AI models used comply with relevant data protection regulations and standards.
- The generated documents are reviewed by qualified personnel to ensure accuracy and compliance.
