MITIGATION STRATEGIES:

- Mitigation strategy: API Key Rotation
  - Description: Implement a system for regular rotation of API keys used by Meal Planner applications to access the AI Nutrition-Pro API. This includes:
    1.  Developing a mechanism within the Web Control Plane for generating new API keys and invalidating old ones.
    2.  Securely storing and managing API keys within the Control Plane Database.
    3.  Providing an interface in the Web Control Plane for administrators or Meal Planner application managers to initiate API key rotation.
    4.  Communicating new API keys securely to Meal Planner applications (e.g., via out-of-band communication or a secure API endpoint).
    5.  Configuring the API Gateway to enforce the use of only valid, non-expired API keys.
  - Threats mitigated:
    - API Key Compromise (High severity): If API keys are static and long-lived, a single compromise grants persistent unauthorized access.
  - Impact: Significantly reduces the risk of prolonged unauthorized access if an API key is compromised. Limits the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit a leaked key.
  - Currently implemented: Not explicitly mentioned in the document. Authentication with API keys is mentioned, but rotation is not.
  - Missing implementation: Web Control Plane (API key rotation management), API Gateway (enforcement of key rotation), Meal Planner integration process (for key updates).

- Mitigation strategy: Robust Rate Limiting and Throttling
  - Description: Enhance rate limiting capabilities in the API Gateway (Kong) to protect against abuse and denial-of-service attacks. This includes:
    1.  Defining rate limits based on various criteria such as API key, IP address, or request type.
    2.  Implementing different rate limits for different API endpoints based on their sensitivity and resource consumption.
    3.  Configuring Kong to return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) when rate limits are exceeded.
    4.  Monitoring rate limiting effectiveness and adjusting limits dynamically based on traffic patterns and detected anomalies.
    5.  Consider implementing adaptive rate limiting that automatically adjusts limits based on real-time traffic analysis.
  - Threats mitigated:
    - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks (High severity): Prevents attackers from overwhelming the API with excessive requests, ensuring availability for legitimate users.
    - Brute-force attacks (Medium severity): Makes it harder for attackers to brute-force API keys or other sensitive information by limiting the number of attempts within a given timeframe.
  - Impact: Protects the API infrastructure from overload and ensures fair usage of resources. Maintains service availability during peak loads or attack attempts.
  - Currently implemented: Mentioned as a feature of API Gateway (Kong), but the robustness and granularity of the configuration are not detailed.
  - Missing implementation: Detailed configuration of rate limiting rules in Kong, monitoring and alerting on rate limiting events, potentially adaptive rate limiting mechanisms.

- Mitigation strategy: Database Access Control and Encryption
  - Description: Implement strong security measures for both Control Plane Database and API database to protect sensitive data. This involves:
    1.  Implementing strict access control policies using database roles and permissions, following the principle of least privilege.
    2.  Ensuring that only authorized services and users can access the databases, with minimal necessary permissions granted.
    3.  Enabling encryption at rest for both RDS instances to protect data stored on disk.
    4.  Enforcing encryption in transit (TLS) for all connections to the databases from the Web Control Plane and Backend API.
    5.  Regularly auditing database access logs to detect and investigate any suspicious activity.
  - Threats mitigated:
    - Data Breach (High severity): Protects sensitive data (tenant information, billing data, dietitian content, LLM interactions) stored in databases from unauthorized access.
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive data (High severity): Prevents internal or external attackers from gaining access to confidential information.
  - Impact: Protects the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data stored in the databases. Reduces the impact of a potential database compromise.
  - Currently implemented: Mentioned as "TLS" for database connections, but encryption at rest and detailed access control policies are not explicitly stated.
  - Missing implementation: Configuration of encryption at rest for RDS instances, detailed database access control policies, database access audit logging and monitoring.

- Mitigation strategy: Secure Configuration and Access Control for Web Control Plane

- Mitigation strategy: Data Minimization and Anonymization for LLM Interactions
  - Description: Minimize the amount of potentially sensitive data sent to the external ChatGPT-3.5 service and implement anonymization techniques where possible. This includes:
    1.  Reviewing the data sent to ChatGPT-3.5 and identifying any potentially sensitive information (e.g., PII, confidential dietitian content).
    2.  Removing or anonymizing sensitive data before sending requests to ChatGPT-3.5, if feasible for the AI functionality.
    3.  Considering using data pseudonymization techniques to replace sensitive data with pseudonyms, if necessary for the LLM to function correctly, and manage pseudonymization keys securely.
    4.  Regularly reviewing and updating data minimization and anonymization strategies as the application evolves and new data types are processed.
  - Threats mitigated:
    - Data Breach via ChatGPT (Medium to High severity, depending on the sensitivity of data exposed and ChatGPT's security posture): Reduces the risk of sensitive data being exposed if ChatGPT-3.5 or OpenAI's systems are compromised.
    - Privacy violations (Medium to High severity): Mitigates potential privacy concerns related to sharing user or dietitian data with a third-party LLM service.
