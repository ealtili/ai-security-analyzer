Here are the mitigation strategies for the AI Nutrition-Pro application based on the provided architecture description:

-   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure API Key Management and Lifecycle
    *   **Description:** Implement a robust system for generating, securely distributing, storing, rotating, and revoking API keys issued to Meal Planner applications. API keys should not be hardcoded or stored in insecure locations. Consider using secrets management systems. Implement automated key rotation policies and clear procedures for revoking compromised keys immediately.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Abuse of Compromised API Key:** An attacker gaining access to a Meal Planner's API key could impersonate that application, potentially accessing data or consuming resources. Severity: High.
    *   **Impact:** High reduction in the risk of unauthorized access and resource abuse via compromised API keys.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** The document mentions "Authentication with Meal Planner applications - each has individual API key," but does not detail the management lifecycle.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Details on secure generation, distribution, storage best practices for clients, rotation, and timely revocation procedures are missing.

-   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enhanced Input Validation and Sanitization for LLM Interaction
    *   **Description:** Before passing any user-provided content (samples, requests from Meal Planner apps) to the ChatGPT-3.5 API, implement strict validation and sanitization. This involves checking input format, size, and potentially filtering or encoding characters that could be interpreted as instructions or malicious prompts by the LLM (Prompt Injection). Consider using libraries or frameworks designed for sanitizing user input before sending it to an external service, especially an LLM.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Prompt Injection via Malicious Input:** An attacker could craft input that manipulates the LLM into generating harmful, biased, or unintended content, or potentially revealing confidential information it might have access to (though less likely with a public API like ChatGPT-3.5). Severity: Medium to High (depending on the potential for harmful output or information leakage).
        *   **Excessive LLM Usage/Costs:** Malformed or excessively large inputs could potentially lead to higher processing costs or unexpected behavior. Severity: Low to Medium.
    *   **Impact:** High reduction in the risk of prompt injection attacks and potential reduction in unexpected LLM costs due to malformed input.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** The API Gateway performs "filtering of input," but it's unclear if this specifically addresses LLM injection vectors.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Explicit validation and sanitization logic within the API Application specifically designed for inputs destined for the LLM is not described.

-   **Mitigation Strategy:** Granular Authorization within Backend Services
    *   **Description:** While the API Gateway provides ACL rules for initial authorization, implement more granular access control logic within the API Application and Web Control Plane. This ensures that authenticated users/applications (via API keys) are only permitted to perform actions and access data they are explicitly authorized for, based on their specific tenant or role. This goes beyond simple path-based ACLs at the gateway.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Actions by Authenticated Users/Apps:** Even if an API key is valid, the associated application might attempt to access data or perform actions belonging to a different tenant or exceeding its privileges. Severity: High.
        *   **Data Leakage Between Tenants:** Without granular checks, one tenant's application could potentially access another tenant's data (samples, requests, responses, control plane data). Severity: High.
    *   **Impact:** High reduction in the risk of horizontal privilege escalation (accessing other tenants' data) and vertical privilege escalation (performing unauthorized administrative actions).
    *   **Currently Implemented:** API Gateway has "ACL rules that allow or deny certain actions." It's unclear if granular checks exist within the backend services.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Detailed authorization logic within the API Application and Web Control Plane to enforce tenant and role-based access control is not described.

-   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Database Access
    *   **Description:** Configure the database credentials used by the API Application and Web Control Plane to have the minimum necessary permissions on their respective Amazon RDS instances. Instead of granting broad administrative rights, restrict permissions to only the specific tables and SQL operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) required for the application's function.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Exfiltration and Tampering on Database Compromise:** If an application container is compromised, an attacker with broad database permissions could steal or modify sensitive data in bulk (dietitian content, tenant data, billing info). Severity: High.
    *   **Impact:** Moderate to High reduction in the potential impact of a container compromise by limiting what an attacker can do with the database connection.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** The document states applications "read/write data" using TLS, but doesn't specify the database user permissions.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Explicit configuration of database user privileges following the principle of least privilege is not described.

-   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Access Control for Web Control Plane
    *   **Description:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for the Web Control Plane used by administrators. This should include multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrator logins and granular role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure administrators can only perform actions appropriate for their specific role (e.g., server configuration, problem resolution, onboarding, billing checks). Access should ideally be restricted to trusted networks or require VPN access.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Administrative Access:** An attacker gaining access to the Control Plane could potentially disrupt the service, alter configurations, access sensitive tenant/billing data, or manipulate the system. Severity: High.
    *   **Impact:** High reduction in the risk of compromise of the central management interface.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** The document describes the Web Control Plane's roles but doesn't specify its own security access controls (authentication, authorization, network restrictions).
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Specific security measures for administrator access to the Web Control Plane (MFA, granular RBAC, network restrictions) are not described.

-   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Monitoring and Alerting for LLM Usage
    *   **Description:** Integrate monitoring and alerting specifically for the volume and cost of calls made to the ChatGPT-3.5 API. Set thresholds based on expected usage patterns. Trigger alerts when usage spikes unexpectedly, which could indicate malicious activity, faulty logic in the application, or a compromised API key being used excessively.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Excessive LLM Usage/Costs:** Malicious activity or errors could lead to unexpectedly high bills from the external LLM provider. Severity: Medium.
        *   **Abuse Detection:** Anomalous LLM usage patterns can be an indicator of other security issues, such as a compromised API key or successful exploitation attempt. Severity: Low (as a primary mitigation) to Medium (as a detection mechanism).
    *   **Impact:** High reduction in the financial impact of uncontrolled LLM usage and improved detection capabilities for certain types of abuse.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not mentioned in the architecture description.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Monitoring and alerting specifically tied to the usage metrics of the external LLM service.
