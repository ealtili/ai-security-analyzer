### Mitigation Strategies for AI Nutrition-Pro Application

Here are mitigation strategies for the AI Nutrition-Pro application, focusing on threats introduced by the described architecture.

#### Mitigation Strategy 1: Implement API Gateway High Availability

*   **Description:** Deploy the Kong API Gateway in a highly available configuration. This can be achieved by running multiple instances of Kong behind a load balancer. Configure health checks for the load balancer to automatically route traffic away from unhealthy instances. Use a distributed data store for Kong configuration to ensure consistency across instances. This setup ensures that if one API Gateway instance fails, others can seamlessly take over, maintaining service availability.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Single point of failure (High severity): If the API Gateway fails, all external access to the application is lost.
*   **Impact:** High - Significantly reduces the risk of application downtime due to API Gateway failure, improving overall system resilience and availability.
*   **Currently implemented:** Not explicitly mentioned in the document. The document mentions "Kong API Gateway" but doesn't specify a high availability setup.
*   **Missing implementation:** High availability configuration for the Kong API Gateway. This includes deploying multiple instances, setting up a load balancer, and using a distributed configuration store.

#### Mitigation Strategy 2: Implement Robust Input Validation and Sanitization

*   **Description:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization at both the API Gateway and the Backend API.
    1.  **API Gateway:** Configure Kong to perform initial input filtering and validation based on expected data types, formats, and sizes. Utilize Kong plugins or custom plugins to enforce input schemas and reject requests with invalid input before they reach the Backend API.
    2.  **Backend API:**  Within the Backend API (Golang application), implement comprehensive input validation logic for all API endpoints. Validate all incoming data against defined schemas, checking for data type, format, length, and allowed values. Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection, LLM prompt injection). Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection. For LLM interactions, sanitize user inputs before including them in prompts to ChatGPT-3.5.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Injection attacks (High severity): SQL injection, NoSQL injection, LLM prompt injection, command injection, etc., could lead to data breaches, system compromise, or manipulation of LLM behavior.
    *   Input manipulation (Medium severity): Malicious or malformed input could cause unexpected application behavior or errors.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks (Medium severity): Processing excessively large or malformed inputs could consume resources and lead to service disruption.
*   **Impact:** High - Significantly reduces the risk of injection attacks and input-related vulnerabilities, improving application security and stability.
*   **Currently implemented:** Input filtering is mentioned as a responsibility of the API Gateway.
*   **Missing implementation:** Detailed input validation and sanitization logic at both the API Gateway level (beyond basic filtering) and within the Backend API application code. Specific sanitization for LLM prompt injection is also missing.

#### Mitigation Strategy 3: Implement Database Security Hardening and Access Control

*   **Description:** Enhance the security of both Control Plane Database and API database by implementing database security best practices:
    1.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant database access only to the necessary components and users with the minimum required privileges. For example, the Backend API should only have access to the API database, and the Web Control Plane should only access the Control Plane Database.
    2.  **Network Segmentation:** Ensure databases are not directly accessible from the public internet. Restrict network access to databases to only authorized internal components (e.g., Backend API, Web Control Plane) using network security groups or firewalls.
    3.  **Regular Security Patching and Updates:** Keep the database systems (Amazon RDS instances) and underlying operating systems up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.
    4.  **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce strong password policies for database users and consider implementing multi-factor authentication for database administrators.
    5.  **Data Encryption at Rest:** Enable encryption at rest for both RDS instances to protect sensitive data stored in the databases.
    6.  **Regular Database Backups:** Implement regular automated database backups and test the restoration process to ensure data recoverability in case of data loss or system failure.
    7.  **Database Auditing:** Enable database auditing to track database access and modifications for security monitoring and incident investigation.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data breaches (Critical severity): Unauthorized access to sensitive data in databases could lead to data theft, leakage, or manipulation.
    *   Unauthorized access to data (High severity): Internal or external attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data if database security is weak.
*   **Impact:** High - Significantly reduces the risk of database compromise and data breaches, protecting sensitive tenant data, billing information, and dietitian content.
*   **Currently implemented:** TLS for database connections is mentioned, indicating encryption in transit.
*   **Missing implementation:** Detailed database security hardening measures, including principle of least privilege, network segmentation, encryption at rest, database auditing, and comprehensive backup and recovery plans.

#### Mitigation Strategy 4: Implement Prompt Injection Attack Prevention for LLM Interaction

*   **Description:** Implement specific measures to prevent prompt injection attacks when interacting with ChatGPT-3.5 from the Backend API:
    1.  **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs received by the Backend API before including them in prompts sent to ChatGPT-3.5. Remove or neutralize potentially malicious input patterns or commands that could manipulate the LLM's behavior.
    2.  **Prompt Engineering:** Design prompts carefully to minimize the risk of injection. Clearly separate instructions from user input within the prompt. Use delimiters or formatting to distinguish between system instructions and user-provided content.
    3.  **Output Monitoring and Validation:** Monitor and validate the responses received from ChatGPT-3.5. Look for unexpected or malicious outputs that might indicate a successful prompt injection attempt. Implement mechanisms to filter or sanitize LLM responses before presenting them to users or Meal Planner applications.
    4.  **Contextual Awareness:**  Maintain context awareness in prompts. If possible, structure prompts to limit the LLM's scope and prevent it from executing unintended commands or actions based on injected input.
    5.  **Regular Security Review of Prompts:** Regularly review and update prompts used for LLM interaction to identify and mitigate potential injection vulnerabilities as new attack techniques emerge.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Prompt injection attacks (Medium to High severity): Attackers could manipulate the LLM's behavior to generate unintended content, bypass security controls, or potentially leak sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Reduces the risk of prompt injection attacks and their potential consequences, ensuring the integrity and security of LLM-generated content.
*   **Currently implemented:** Not mentioned in the document.
*   **Missing implementation:** Prompt injection prevention measures in the Backend API's interaction with ChatGPT-3.5. This includes input sanitization, prompt engineering best practices, and output monitoring.

#### Mitigation Strategy 5: Implement Robust Rate Limiting and Throttling

*   **Description:** Enhance rate limiting and throttling capabilities at the API Gateway to protect against abuse and denial of service attacks:
    1.  **Granular Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting based on various criteria, such as API keys (per Meal Planner application), IP addresses, or user accounts. This allows for fine-grained control over API usage.
    2.  **Adaptive Rate Limiting:** Consider implementing adaptive rate limiting that dynamically adjusts limits based on real-time traffic patterns and system load. This can help to automatically mitigate sudden traffic spikes or attacks.
    3.  **Throttling:** Implement throttling mechanisms to not only limit the number of requests but also to slow down or delay requests when limits are exceeded. This can further discourage abuse and protect backend resources.
    4.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitor rate limiting effectiveness and set up alerts for when rate limits are frequently exceeded or when potential rate limiting bypass attempts are detected.
    5.  **Customizable Error Responses:** Configure API Gateway to return informative and customizable error responses when rate limits are exceeded, guiding legitimate users and discouraging malicious actors.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks (High severity): Attackers could overwhelm the application with excessive requests, leading to service disruption.
    *   Resource exhaustion (Medium severity): High request volumes could exhaust backend resources, impacting performance and availability for legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Reduces the risk of DoS attacks and resource exhaustion, ensuring service availability and fair resource allocation.
*   **Currently implemented:** Rate limiting is mentioned as a responsibility of the API Gateway.
*   **Missing implementation:** Details on the robustness and granularity of rate limiting configuration are missing. Adaptive rate limiting, throttling, monitoring, and customizable error responses are likely not implemented.

#### Mitigation Strategy 6: Implement Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring

*   **Description:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring across all components of the AI Nutrition-Pro application:
    1.  **Centralized Logging:** Implement a centralized logging system to collect logs from all components (API Gateway, Web Control Plane, Backend API, Control Plane Database, API database). Use a log management solution (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, AWS CloudWatch Logs) for efficient log storage, searching, and analysis.
    2.  **Detailed Logging:** Log relevant events, including:
        *   API requests and responses (including headers and bodies, if appropriate and sensitive data is masked).
        *   Authentication and authorization events.
        *   Errors and exceptions.
        *   Security events (e.g., suspicious activity, failed login attempts, rate limiting events).
        *   Performance metrics (e.g., request latency, resource utilization).
    3.  **Real-time Monitoring:** Set up real-time monitoring dashboards to visualize key metrics and system health. Monitor for anomalies, errors, and security events.
    4.  **Alerting:** Configure alerts to notify administrators of critical errors, security incidents, performance degradation, or other anomalies that require immediate attention.
    5.  **Log Retention and Analysis:** Define log retention policies and regularly analyze logs for security incidents, performance bottlenecks, and application issues.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Lack of visibility (Medium severity): Without proper logging and monitoring, it's difficult to detect and diagnose issues, including security incidents.
    *   Delayed incident response (Medium severity): Delayed detection of security incidents can increase their impact and allow attackers to persist longer.
    *   Security breaches (High severity): Lack of monitoring can lead to undetected security breaches and data compromises.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Improves incident detection and response capabilities, enhances security visibility, and facilitates troubleshooting and performance optimization.
*   **Currently implemented:** Not mentioned in the document.
*   **Missing implementation:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring infrastructure and implementation across all application components.

#### Mitigation Strategy 7: Implement Dependency on ChatGPT-3.5 Resiliency

*   **Description:** Implement strategies to mitigate the application's dependency on the external ChatGPT-3.5 service:
    1.  **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Implement the circuit breaker pattern for calls to ChatGPT-3.5 from the Backend API. This pattern prevents the application from repeatedly attempting to call ChatGPT-3.5 when it is unavailable or experiencing issues. When ChatGPT-3.5 is detected as unhealthy, the circuit breaker should open, and the application should gracefully handle the failure (e.g., return a cached response, display an error message, or use a fallback mechanism).
    2.  **Fallback Mechanism:** Explore and implement a fallback mechanism in case ChatGPT-3.5 is unavailable or experiencing performance issues. This could involve:
        *   Using a cached version of previously generated content.
        *   Using a simpler, less feature-rich AI model as a backup.
        *   Providing a degraded user experience that does not rely on LLM functionality.
    3.  **Asynchronous Communication:** Use asynchronous communication patterns for interacting with ChatGPT-3.5 to prevent blocking the Backend API's main threads and improve responsiveness.
    4.  **Monitoring ChatGPT-3.5 Availability:** Monitor the availability and performance of ChatGPT-3.5 service. Implement health checks and alerts to detect outages or performance degradation.
    5.  **Vendor Diversification (Long-term):** In the long term, consider diversifying LLM providers to reduce reliance on a single external service. Explore alternative LLM solutions and potentially integrate with multiple providers for redundancy.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Dependency on external service (Medium severity): Application availability and functionality are dependent on the availability of ChatGPT-3.5. Outages or performance issues with ChatGPT-3.5 can directly impact AI Nutrition-Pro.
    *   External service security issues (Medium severity): Security vulnerabilities or breaches in ChatGPT-3.5 could potentially indirectly impact AI Nutrition-Pro if not properly isolated.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Reduces the impact of ChatGPT-3.5 outages or performance issues on the application, improving overall resilience and user experience.
*   **Currently implemented:** Not mentioned in the document.
*   **Missing implementation:** Circuit breaker, fallback mechanisms, asynchronous communication, and monitoring for ChatGPT-3.5 dependency are not implemented. Vendor diversification is a long-term consideration that is also missing.
