# Threat Modeling Analysis for the Fabric Agent Action Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

### Overview

**Fabric Agent Action** is a GitHub Action that automates complex workflows by leveraging [Fabric Patterns](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/tree/main/patterns) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Built with [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph), it intelligently selects and executes patterns using an agent-based approach. The action integrates with multiple LLM providers, including OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic.

**Key Functionalities:**

- **Seamless Integration:** Easily incorporate the action into existing workflows.
- **Multi-Provider Support:** Choose between OpenAI, OpenRouter, or Anthropic based on preference and availability.
- **Configurable Agent Behavior:** Select agent types (`router`, `react`, `react_issue`, or `react_pr`) and customize behavior.
- **Flexible Pattern Management:** Include or exclude specific Fabric Patterns to optimize performance.

### Key Components and Features

- **Agents:** Different types (`router`, `react`, `react_issue`, `react_pr`) that process Fabric patterns.
- **LLM Providers:** Supports OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic for LLM interactions.
- **Configuration Options:** Customizable inputs for agent behavior, LLM models, temperatures, and patterns inclusion/exclusion.
- **Fabric Patterns:** A collection of predefined patterns from the Fabric project executed by the agent.
- **Security Controls:** Access control patterns recommended to prevent unauthorized usage and protect API costs.

### Dependencies

- **LangGraph and LangChain Libraries:** Used for building the agents' graphs and managing LLM interactions.
- **LLM APIs:** Requires API keys for OpenAI, OpenRouter, or Anthropic.
- **Fabric Patterns Repository:** Relies on the Fabric project for patterns execution.

## 2. Define the Root Goal of the Attack Tree

**Attacker's Ultimate Objective:**

To exploit vulnerabilities in the Fabric Agent Action to execute unauthorized code or commands, access sensitive data (including API keys), or misuse LLM APIs, thereby compromising systems that use the action.

## 3. Identify High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)

1. **Trigger Unauthorized Workflow Execution**
   - Exploit misconfigurations to trigger the action with malicious inputs.

2. **Inject Malicious Inputs via Issue/PR Comments**
   - Use specially crafted comments to cause the action to execute unintended commands or code.

3. **Exploit Insecure Handling of Secrets**
   - Gain access to API keys or secrets stored in GitHub secrets.

4. **Tamper with Fabric Patterns**
   - Modify or replace Fabric patterns to execute malicious code.

5. **Compromise the Action's Codebase**
   - Introduce malicious code into the action's repository or deceive users into using a malicious version.

6. **Abuse LLM APIs for Malicious Purposes**

## 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

### High-Risk Paths

1. **Inject Malicious Inputs via Issue/PR Comments**
   - **Justification:** Public repositories allow anyone to comment. If the action processes these comments without proper validation and access control, it can lead to unauthorized code execution.

2. **Trigger Unauthorized Workflow Execution**
   - **Justification:** Misconfigured workflows can be exploited to trigger actions by unauthorized users, especially in forked repositories or through insufficient permission checks.

### Critical Nodes

- **Access Control Implementation**
  - Mitigating unauthorized workflow execution and malicious input injection requires robust access control measures in workflows.

- **Input Validation and Sanitization**
  - Proper validation of all inputs can prevent code injection and unintended command execution.

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies

- **Enforce Strict Access Controls**
  - Implement checks in workflows to ensure only authorized users can trigger the action.
  - Use `if` conditions to validate the comment author's identity against trusted users.

- **Validate and Sanitize Inputs**
  - Implement thorough input validation to prevent injection attacks.
  - Sanitize inputs received from issue comments and pull requests.

- **Secure Handling of Secrets**
  - Use GitHub secrets securely and avoid exposing them in logs or outputs.
  - Limit the scope of secrets and enforce regular rotation.

- **Monitor and Rate Limit API Usage**
  - Implement monitoring to detect unusual API usage patterns.
  - Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse and control costs.

- **Verify Integrity of Fabric Patterns**
  - Avoid runtime downloading of patterns; include them in the repository.
  - Use checksum verification if downloads are necessary.

- **Secure the Codebase**
  - Enforce branch protection rules and mandatory code reviews.
  - Monitor for unauthorized access attempts and unusual activities.

## 9. Summarize Findings

### Key Risks Identified

- **Unauthorized Workflow Execution:** High risk due to potential misconfigurations and public access.
- **Malicious Input Injection:** High risk from unvalidated inputs via issue or PR comments.
- **Exposure of Secrets:** Critical impact if API keys are exfiltrated.
- **Tampering with Patterns:** Potential for executing malicious code if patterns are compromised.
- **Abuse of LLM APIs:** Financial impact and potential data leakage from uncontrolled API usage.

### Recommended Actions

- **Implement Robust Access Controls:** Secure workflows to limit action triggers to authorized users.
- **Enhance Input Validation:** Sanitize all inputs and implement strict validation to prevent injections.
- **Protect Secrets:** Securely manage API keys and monitor their usage.
- **Control Pattern Updates:** Include patterns in the repository and verify their integrity.
- **Monitor and Limit API Usage:** Set up alerts and rate limiting to detect and prevent abuse.
- **Strengthen Codebase Security:** Apply best practices in code repository management and security.

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

### Questions

- **Input Validation Mechanisms:**
  - Are there existing safeguards to validate and sanitize inputs from issue comments or pull requests?
- **Pattern Update Process:**
  - How frequently are Fabric Patterns updated, and is runtime downloading necessary?
- **Workflow Configurations:**
  - Are default workflows secure against unauthorized triggering, especially in public repositories?

### Assumptions

- **Public Repository Usage:**
  - The action is used in public repositories where anyone can comment unless restricted.
- **Current Lack of Input Validation:**
  - Inputs from issue comments are not currently validated or sanitized.
- **Secure Storage of Secrets:**
  - API keys are stored in GitHub secrets but may be exposed through logging or outputs if not properly managed.

---

**Note:** Addressing these risks promptly will significantly enhance the security posture of the Fabric Agent Action, safeguarding both the action and the systems that rely on it.
