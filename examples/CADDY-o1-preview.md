### DEPLOYMENT

Caddy can be deployed in various environments. Here, we describe a typical deployment on a Linux server, including configuration loading from the Caddyfile, utilization of the events system, logging, metrics collection, reverse proxy functionality, FastCGI, PKI management, ACME server, On-Demand TLS, Session Ticket Management, and other modules.

### BUILD

The build process uses Continuous Integration (CI) workflows defined in the `.github/workflows` directory. GitHub Actions are used to automate testing, building, and releasing.

**Build Process Overview:**

1. **Code Commit:** Developers push code changes to the repository.
2. **CI Trigger:** GitHub Actions are triggered on push or pull requests (Defined in `ci.yml`, `cross-build.yml`, `lint.yml`).
3. **Environment Setup:** The CI environment sets up the required Go version and dependencies.
4. **Static Analysis and Linting:** Code quality checks using `golangci-lint` (Configured in `lint.yml`).
5. **Building:** The code is compiled into binaries for different platforms (Managed in `cross-build.yml`).
6. **Testing:** Automated tests are run to ensure code integrity, including integration tests and unit tests in various modules.
7. **Fuzz Testing:** Fuzz tests are performed to find edge-case bugs.
8. **Releasing:** On tagging a release, artifacts are built and published (Defined in `release.yml`).

**Security Controls in Build Process:**

- Security control: Use of Go modules ensures dependency management and integrity (`go.mod`, `go.sum` files).
- Security control: Automated linting and static code analysis to detect vulnerabilities early.
- Security control: Integration and unit tests for critical components to ensure security and functionality.
- Security control: Fuzz testing to find security issues and bugs.
- Security control: Access controls on CI/CD pipelines to prevent unauthorized changes.
- Security control: Signing release artifacts to verify the integrity of distributed binaries.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**Critical Business Processes to Protect:**

- Web Content Delivery: Ensure uninterrupted and secure delivery of web content to users.
- Configuration Integrity: Maintain the integrity and confidentiality of configuration files and data, including Caddyfile parsing.
- TLS Certificate Management: Maintain the integrity and confidentiality of TLS certificates and keys.
- Authentication Processes: Secure handling of user authentication and credential management.
- Event Handling: Ensure that the event system is secure and cannot be abused to manipulate server behavior.
- Administrative Access: Protect admin interfaces and configuration endpoints from unauthorized access and potential tampering.
- Logging and Monitoring: Ensure that logging and metrics collection do not expose sensitive information and are protected from unauthorized access.
- Testing Infrastructure: Ensure the security and reliability of the testing framework to prevent false positives/negatives.
- File Serving: Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories through the file server.
- Reverse Proxy Operations: Secure the proxying of requests to backend services to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage.
- Backend Server Communication: Ensure secure and authenticated communication with backend services.
- Dynamic Content Execution: Secure execution of dynamic content via FastCGI to prevent code injection and unauthorized execution.
- Template Rendering: Safely render templates to prevent injection attacks and exposure of sensitive data.
- Authentication Mechanisms: Protect forward authentication processes to prevent unauthorized access.
- Tracing Data Integrity: Ensure tracing data does not leak sensitive information and is protected from unauthorized access.
- PKI Management: Secure management of PKI operations to prevent compromise of certificates and keys.
- Certificate Issuance Processes: Ensure that certificate issuance via the internal CA and ACME server is secure and cannot be abused.
- Key Management: Protect cryptographic keys used in PKI and ensure proper storage and handling.
- Compliance with CA/B Forum Baseline Requirements: Operating a CA may require compliance with industry standards.
- On-Demand TLS Processes: Protect the on-demand TLS functionality to prevent unauthorized certificate issuance and misuse.
- Session Ticket Key Management: Ensure that session ticket keys are securely generated, stored, and rotated.
- Certificate Loading Mechanisms: Securely handle certificate loading from various sources to prevent injection of malicious certificates.

**Data to Protect and Their Sensitivity:**

- User Credentials: Highly sensitive; compromise could lead to unauthorized access.
- TLS Private Keys: Highly sensitive; compromise could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Configuration Data: Sensitive; unauthorized changes could disrupt services or introduce vulnerabilities.
- Event Data: Sensitive; could reveal internal server processes or be manipulated to alter server behavior.
- Log Data: May contain sensitive user information and must be protected to maintain confidentiality and integrity.
- Metrics Data: Could reveal server performance and usage patterns; should be protected to prevent misuse.
- User Data: Data passing through the server must be protected to maintain confidentiality and integrity.
- Access Logs: May contain sensitive user information that must be protected.
- Test Artifacts: Ensure that test data and logs do not expose sensitive information.
- Backend Data: Data received from or sent to backend services via the reverse proxy; must be protected to prevent data leakage or manipulation.
- FastCGI Inputs and Outputs: Data processed via FastCGI may contain sensitive information and should be secured.
- Template Variables: Data used in templates could expose sensitive information if improperly handled.
- Authentication Tokens: Tokens and credentials used in forward authentication must be protected.
