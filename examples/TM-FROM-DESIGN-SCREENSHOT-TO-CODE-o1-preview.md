# TRUST BOUNDARIES

1. **User's Browser to Frontend Application**: The application cannot fully trust inputs from the user's browser.
2. **Frontend Application to Backend API**: Trust boundary between client-side and server-side; backend cannot trust the frontend blindly.
3. **Backend API to External AI Services**: Communication with OpenAI and Anthropic APIs over the internet crosses a trust boundary.
4. **Browser Storage**: Locally stored data in the user's browser can be accessed by scripts; trust boundary exists between application code and stored data.
5. **Hosted Environment to External Users**: The hosted version is accessible publicly; trust boundary between the server and any external client.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

**Questions**:

1. **Authentication Implementation**:
   - Are there any plans to implement authentication mechanisms for the hosted version to prevent unauthorized access?
2. **API Key Management**:
   - How are API keys secured on the frontend, and is there a possibility to avoid storing them in browser storage?
3. **Input Handling**:
   - What validation mechanisms are currently in place for user-provided images and inputs on both frontend and backend?
4. **Server Security**:
   - What server hardening practices are currently implemented to secure the hosting environment?
5. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Is there a logging and monitoring system to detect and respond to potential security incidents?

**Assumptions**:

- **User Responsibility**:
  - Users running the application locally are responsible for securing their environment and API keys.
- **Open Source Nature**:
  - The open-source code is regularly reviewed and updated to mitigate vulnerabilities inherent in publicly accessible codebases.
- **Communication Security**:
  - All communications between components and external services are conducted over secure channels (HTTPS) with proper certificate validation.
- **Resource Management**:
  - There are no current mechanisms for resource management such as rate limiting, but they are planned for future implementation.
- **Input Validation**:
  - Input validation is recognized as necessary but is not fully implemented on both frontend and backend.
