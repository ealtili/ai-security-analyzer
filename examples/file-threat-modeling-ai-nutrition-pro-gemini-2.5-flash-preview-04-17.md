# APPLICATION THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS

*   **Tenant Data:** Information about the different Meal Planner applications and their configurations, stored in the Control Plane Database. This includes API keys, billing information, and onboarding details.
*   **Dietitian Content Samples:** Proprietary content samples provided by dietitians via Meal Planner applications, stored in the API Database. This data is sensitive intellectual property.
*   **LLM Request/Response Data:** The specific prompts sent to ChatGPT and the generated responses, stored in the API Database. This data reveals the application's interaction patterns with the LLM and potentially sensitive context from the dietitian samples.
*   **Application Configuration Data:** Settings and parameters managed by the Administrator via the Web Control Plane, stored in the Control Plane Database. Misconfiguration can impact security and functionality.
*   **API Keys:** Credentials used by Meal Planner applications to authenticate with the API Gateway. Compromise allows unauthorized access and potential spoofing.
*   **Internal Service Credentials/Secrets:** Credentials used by internal services (API Gateway, Web Control Plane, API Application) to communicate with each other, databases, or external services (like OpenAI). Compromise allows internal system access or data exfiltration.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES

*   **External System Trust Boundary:** Separates the AI Nutrition-Pro internal network from external systems like Meal Planner applications and ChatGPT-3.5. Meal Planner applications are partially trusted (authenticated via API keys), while ChatGPT is an untrusted external API.
*   **Administrator Trust Boundary:** Separates the trusted Administrator user from the Web Control Plane interface. Authentication and authorization are required to cross this boundary.
*   **Internal Container Trust Boundary:** Separates the different internal containers (API Gateway, Web Control Plane, API Application) from each other. While within the same logical boundary (AI Nutrition-Pro), communication between them should be authenticated and authorized.
*   **Database Trust Boundary:** Separates the application containers (Web Control Plane, API Application) from the databases (Control Plane Database, API Database). Access to databases should be restricted and authenticated.

## DATA FLOWS

*   **Meal Planner -> API Gateway:** HTTPS/REST. Crosses External System Trust Boundary. Authenticated using API Key.
*   **API Gateway -> Backend API:** HTTPS/REST. Crosses Internal Container Trust Boundary.
*   **Backend API -> ChatGPT:** HTTPS/REST. Crosses External System Trust Boundary. Requires API key/credentials for ChatGPT.

*   **Backend API -> API database:** TLS. Crosses Database Trust Boundary. Requires database credentials.
*   **App Control Plane -> Control Plane Database:** TLS. Crosses Database Trust Boundary. Requires database credentials. (Duplicate flow from diagram, listed for completeness).

## APPLICATION THREATS

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | STRIDE CATEGORY | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0001 | API Gateway | An attacker could spoof a legitimate Meal Planner application by using a stolen API key. | Spoofing | API Gateway relies solely on API keys for authentication of Meal Planner applications. Compromise of a key allows unauthorized access masquerading as the legitimate client. | The system uses individual API keys for each Meal Planner application. (Ref: Security 1) | Implement additional authentication factors for Meal Planner applications, such as IP whitelisting or mutual TLS, especially for high-privilege actions. Implement API key rotation policies and monitoring for unusual usage patterns. | Moderate - API keys can be leaked or stolen if not handled securely by the Meal Planner application or during transmission/storage. | High - Allows unauthorized access to AI generation features, potential data theft or misuse of the system under the guise of a legitimate client, leading to billing issues and reputation damage. | High |
| 0002 | Meal Planner -> API Gateway Data Flow | An attacker could intercept and tamper with requests or responses between Meal Planner and API Gateway. | Tampering | Data is exchanged over a network. While TLS is used, implementation flaws could exist. | Network traffic is encrypted using TLS. (Ref: Security 3) | Ensure TLS is correctly configured and enforced with strong cipher suites and certificate validation. Implement request/response integrity checks (e.g., digital signatures) for critical data flows, although this adds complexity. | Low - TLS mitigates this significantly, assuming correct implementation. | Moderate - Tampered requests could lead to incorrect AI generation or data storage. Tampered responses could mislead the Meal Planner application or end user. | Low |
| 0003 | API Database | An attacker could tamper with dietitian content samples or LLM request/response data stored in the database. | Tampering | If the API Application or the database credentials/access controls are compromised, data at rest can be modified. | Access to the database is restricted to the API Application and communication uses TLS. (Ref: Data Flow diagrams) | Implement robust input validation and sanitization in the API Application. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Enforce principle of least privilege for database user accounts. Implement database activity monitoring and integrity checks. | Moderate - Depends on the security of the API Application and database configuration. | High - Corrupted training data or LLM interaction logs could degrade AI quality, lead to incorrect output, or hide malicious activity. | High |
| 0004 | Administrator -> Web Control Plane Data Flow | An administrator could repudiate configuration changes made via the Web Control Plane. | Repudiation | The system needs a way to definitively attribute configuration changes to a specific administrator account. | Not explicitly mentioned in the provided file. | Implement detailed logging and auditing of all administrator actions within the Web Control Plane, including timestamps and the identity of the administrator performing the action. Store logs securely and make them tamper-evident. | Moderate - Possible if logging is insufficient or missing. | Moderate - Makes incident investigation and accountability difficult. | Moderate |
| 0005 | API Database | An attacker could gain unauthorized access to and disclose dietitian content samples or LLM request/response data from the API Database. | Information Disclosure | The database contains sensitive and proprietary information. Compromise of the database server, credentials, or a vulnerability in the API Application could lead to data leakage. | Access is restricted to the API Application via TLS. (Ref: Data Flow diagrams) | Enforce strong access controls on the database. Encrypt data at rest. Regularly audit database access logs. Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems monitoring database traffic. | High - Databases are common targets, and a single vulnerability can expose large amounts of data. | Critical - Leakage of proprietary dietitian content or LLM interactions is a major breach, impacting IP, potentially exposing sensitive user data within prompts, and causing significant reputation damage. | Critical |
| 0006 | Control Plane Database | An attacker could gain unauthorized access to and disclose tenant data (API keys, billing info) from the Control Plane Database. | Information Disclosure | The database contains sensitive tenant and operational data. Compromise of the database server, credentials, or a vulnerability in the Web Control Plane could lead to data leakage. | Access is restricted to the Web Control Plane via TLS. (Ref: Data Flow diagrams) | Encrypt sensitive fields (like API keys) in the database. Enforce strong access controls on the database. Regularly audit database access logs. Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems monitoring database traffic. | High - Contains critical operational and tenant data. | Critical - Leakage of API keys allows spoofing (0001). Leakage of billing/tenant data is a major privacy and business risk. | Critical |
| 0007 | API Gateway | An attacker could perform a Denial of Service attack by overwhelming the API Gateway with requests. | Denial of Service | The API Gateway is the entry point for Meal Planner applications and handles rate limiting, but it can still be a target for high-volume attacks. | API Gateway provides rate limiting. (Ref: API Gateway description) | Configure robust rate limiting and burst protection on the API Gateway. Implement WAF rules to filter malicious traffic. Utilize network-level DoS protection services (e.g., AWS Shield). | High - Standard attack vector against public APIs. | High - Prevents legitimate Meal Planner applications from accessing the service, disrupting business operations. | High |
| 0008 | Backend API -> ChatGPT Data Flow | Excessive or malicious requests from the Backend API could lead to high costs on the ChatGPT-3.5 service. | Denial of Service | An attacker compromising the Backend API or injecting malicious input could cause it to make excessive calls to the LLM, leading to unexpected billing costs. | Not explicitly mentioned. | Implement rate limiting or quota management within the Backend API for calls to the external LLM service. Monitor LLM API usage and set up billing alerts. Validate and sanitize input before constructing LLM prompts. | Moderate - Requires compromise of the Backend API or successful input injection. | High - Can lead to significant, unexpected operational costs. | High |
| 0009 | API Application | An attacker could achieve Elevation of Privilege within the API Application, potentially gaining access to database credentials or internal network access. | Elevation of Privilege | Vulnerabilities in the API Application (e.g., code injection, deserialization flaws) could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or gain higher privileges than intended. | Not explicitly mentioned. | Implement secure coding practices (input validation, avoiding risky functions). Use least privilege for the application's runtime environment and permissions. Regularly scan the application code for vulnerabilities (SAST). | High - Application code often contains vulnerabilities. | Critical - Could lead to full compromise of the API Application, access to sensitive data, and potentially lateral movement within the internal network. | Critical |
| 0010 | Web Control Plane | An attacker could achieve Elevation of Privilege within the Web Control Plane, potentially gaining administrator privileges or access to sensitive configuration/database credentials. | Elevation of Privilege | Vulnerabilities in the Web Control Plane (e.g., authentication bypass, injection flaws, broken access control) could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access or higher privileges. | Authentication of clients is mentioned for API Gateway, but not explicitly for the Web Control Plane. | Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for the Web Control Plane. Use least privilege for administrator accounts. Implement secure coding practices. Regularly scan the application code for vulnerabilities (SAST). | High - Web applications are frequent targets for privilege escalation attacks. | Critical - Could lead to full control over application configuration, access to all tenant data, and potentially compromise of the entire system. | Critical |

# DEPLOYMENT THREAT MODEL

Deployment Architecture: The description mentions AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) for containers and Amazon RDS for databases. A common architecture would involve deploying these within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), using Security Groups for network segmentation, and potentially an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of the API Gateway. We will assume this standard AWS deployment pattern.

## ASSETS

*   **ECS Cluster/Tasks:** The runtime environment hosting the API Gateway, Web Control Plane, and API Application containers.
*   **RDS Instances:** The database servers for Control Plane Database and API Database.
*   **Container Images:** The Docker images deployed to ECS.
*   **AWS Infrastructure Configuration:** VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, Load Balancers, IAM Roles, ECS Service definitions, RDS configuration.
*   **Secrets Management:** AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store used to store database credentials, API keys, LLM credentials, etc.
*   **Network Traffic:** Data flowing between AWS components within the VPC and to/from external networks.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES

*   **VPC Boundary:** Separates the internal AWS network infrastructure from the public internet.
*   **Security Group Boundaries:** Network-level boundaries restricting traffic between different components (e.g., API Gateway SG vs. Backend API SG vs. RDS SG).
*   **ECS Task Boundary:** The boundary around individual container tasks within the ECS cluster.
*   **RDS Instance Boundary:** The boundary around the database instances.
*   **AWS Account Boundary:** The highest level boundary, separating the entire infrastructure from other AWS accounts.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Security Groups | Misconfigured Security Groups could allow unauthorized network access between components or from the internet to internal services. | Security Groups are the primary network access control mechanism in AWS. Errors can expose services. | Not explicitly detailed, standard AWS practice implies Security Groups are used. | Implement strict, least-privilege Security Group rules allowing traffic only on necessary ports and protocols between specific sources/destinations. Regularly audit Security Group configurations. | High - Misconfiguration is a very common cloud security issue. | Critical - Can bypass application-level controls and expose databases or internal services directly to attackers. | Critical |
| 1002 | Secrets Management (e.g., Parameter Store, Secrets Manager) | Secrets (database credentials, API keys, LLM keys) are exposed due to misconfiguration or compromised IAM roles. | Secrets are critical assets needed by applications at runtime. If stored insecurely or accessed with excessive permissions, they can be leaked. | Not explicitly detailed how secrets are managed. | Use a dedicated secrets management service (AWS Secrets Manager, Parameter Store Secure String) instead of storing secrets in environment variables or code. Restrict access to secrets using fine-grained IAM policies for ECS tasks/services. | Moderate - Common vulnerability if not managed correctly. | Critical - Compromised secrets allow attackers to access databases, external services (incurring costs), or impersonate clients. | Critical |
| 1003 | RDS Instances | Data exfiltration from RDS instances due to compromised credentials or network access. | RDS databases hold sensitive data (tenant info, dietitian samples, LLM interactions). | Access is restricted by Security Groups and requires credentials. (Inferred from standard AWS practices). | Enforce strong, unique credentials for database users. Rotate credentials regularly. Enable encryption at rest and in transit (already mentioned TLS). Monitor database access logs. Restrict egress traffic from database subnets where possible. | High - Databases are prime targets. | Critical - Leads to massive data breach of sensitive tenant, dietitian, and operational data. | Critical |
| 1004 | ECS Tasks (Containers) | Vulnerable container images are deployed, leading to compromise of the running application instances. | Applications run within Docker containers. If the base image or application dependencies have known vulnerabilities, the container can be exploited. | Not explicitly mentioned. | Implement vulnerability scanning in the build pipeline (see Build Threat Model). Use minimal, trusted base images. Keep dependencies updated. | High - Software vulnerabilities are common. | High - Compromise of a container can lead to data theft, unauthorized actions, or pivot points for further attacks. | High |
| 1005 | IAM Roles/Policies | Misconfigured IAM roles grant excessive permissions to ECS tasks or administrators, leading to privilege escalation within the AWS environment. | IAM controls access to AWS resources. Overly broad permissions can allow compromised entities to access unrelated services or data. | Not explicitly detailed how IAM roles are configured. | Apply the principle of least privilege to all IAM roles used by ECS tasks and administrators. Regularly audit IAM policies. Use condition keys to further restrict permissions (e.g., allowing actions only from specific VPCs). | Moderate - IAM misconfigurations are frequent and powerful. | Critical - Allows attackers to potentially control the entire AWS account, access all data, or disrupt services. | Critical |
| 1006 | Load Balancer (ALB) | Denial of Service attack against the ALB, preventing legitimate traffic from reaching the API Gateway. | The ALB is the public entry point. | Not explicitly mentioned, but standard practice for public-facing web services on AWS. | Utilize AWS Shield Standard/Advanced for DDoS protection. Configure ALB security policies and WAF rules to filter malicious traffic. Ensure ALB and backend target capacity is sufficient. | High - Standard attack vector against public endpoints. | High - Prevents users (Meal Planners) from accessing the application, disrupting business operations. | High |

# BUILD THREAT MODEL

Build Process: The description mentions Golang and Docker containers deployed to AWS ECS. A typical build process would involve:
1. Source code in a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, CodeCommit).
2. A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline) triggered by code commits.
3. Building the Golang application binaries.
4. Building Docker images containing the application binaries.
5. Storing Docker images in a registry (e.g., Amazon ECR).
6. Deployment trigger (manual or automated) from the registry to ECS.
We will assume a standard automated CI/CD pipeline process.

## ASSETS

*   **Source Code:** The Golang source code for the Web Control Plane and API Application.
*   **Build Configuration:** Dockerfiles, CI/CD pipeline scripts (e.g., Jenkinsfile, GitHub Actions workflow).
*   **CI/CD System:** The build server/runners executing the pipeline.
*   **Build Secrets:** Credentials needed by the pipeline (e.g., for accessing dependencies, pushing to ECR).
*   **Built Artifacts:** Docker images stored in the container registry (ECR).
*   **Dependencies:** External libraries and packages used by the Golang application and Docker images.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES

*   **Developer Machine Trust Boundary:** Separates the developer's potentially less secure local environment from the trusted source code repository and CI/CD system.
*   **Source Code Repository Trust Boundary:** Separates the code repository from the CI/CD system. Access control within the repository is crucial.
*   **CI/CD System Trust Boundary:** The boundary around the build environment itself. This system needs access to source code and potentially secrets.
*   **Container Registry Trust Boundary:** Separates the CI/CD system from the image registry (ECR).

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2001 | Source Code Repository | Malicious code is injected into the source code repository, potentially introducing backdoors or vulnerabilities into the application. | The build process starts from source code. If the repository is compromised or code review processes are weak, malicious code can be introduced. | Not explicitly mentioned regarding source code security. | Implement strong access controls on the source code repository. Enforce multi-factor authentication for commits. Implement mandatory code review processes (e.g., pull requests requiring review from multiple team members). Use branch protection rules. | High - Insider threat or compromised developer accounts are significant risks. | Critical - Introduces vulnerabilities or malicious functionality directly into the deployed application. | Critical |
| 2002 | Dependencies | Supply chain attack via vulnerable or malicious third-party libraries used in the Golang application or Docker images. | Applications rely heavily on external dependencies. Compromised or vulnerable dependencies can introduce security flaws. | Not explicitly mentioned. | Implement automated dependency scanning (e.g., using tools like Trivy, Snyk) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify known vulnerabilities. Verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies. Consider using a private dependency mirror. | High - Supply chain attacks are increasingly common. | High - Can introduce critical vulnerabilities or backdoors without changes to the application's own code. | High |
| 2003 | CI/CD System (Runner/Agent) | A compromised CI/CD runner or build agent is used to leak secrets, tamper with the build process, or inject malicious code into artifacts. | The CI/CD system has access to source code, build secrets, and the ability to push artifacts. It is a high-value target. | Not explicitly mentioned. | Isolate CI/CD runners/agents. Run them with minimal privileges. Avoid storing long-lived secrets directly on runners. Use ephemeral runners. Monitor CI/CD system logs for suspicious activity. | Moderate - CI/CD infrastructure requires careful security configuration. | Critical - A compromised build system can undermine the security of all deployed applications, allowing attackers to push malicious versions. | Critical |
| 2004 | Build Secrets | Secrets used during the build process (e.g., ECR push credentials, dependency access tokens) are leaked from the CI/CD environment or configuration. | Secrets are necessary for the pipeline to function but are sensitive assets. | Not explicitly mentioned how build secrets are managed. | Store build secrets securely in the CI/CD system's secrets management feature (e.g., GitHub Actions Secrets, Jenkins Credentials Manager, AWS Secrets Manager accessible via IAM roles). Avoid hardcoding secrets in build scripts or Dockerfiles. Use temporary credentials where possible. | Moderate - Common source of leaks if not handled carefully. | High - Leaked credentials could allow attackers to push malicious images to the registry or access other internal resources. | High |
| 2005 | Container Registry (ECR) | Tampering with built Docker images stored in the container registry before deployment. | If the registry is not secured correctly, an attacker could replace legitimate images with malicious ones or modify existing ones. | Not explicitly mentioned regarding registry security. | Implement strong access controls (IAM policies) on the container registry (ECR) allowing push/pull only from authorized CI/CD roles and deployment systems. Enable image scanning in the registry. Use image signing (e.g., Notary, Sigstore) to verify image integrity before deployment. | Moderate - Requires access to the registry with push permissions. | Critical - Allows attackers to deploy malicious versions of the application. | Critical |
| 2006 | Build Process | Repudiation of who triggered a specific build or code change that resulted in a deployed artifact. | Without proper logging and audit trails, it can be difficult to determine accountability for changes introduced via the build pipeline. | Not explicitly mentioned regarding build process logging. | Ensure the CI/CD pipeline logs who triggered a build and which specific commit/source code version was used. Link builds back to specific commits and users in the source code repository. Store build logs securely. | Low - Most modern CI/CD systems provide some level of traceability by default. | Low - Primarily impacts incident response and accountability, less direct impact on system availability or data. | Low |
