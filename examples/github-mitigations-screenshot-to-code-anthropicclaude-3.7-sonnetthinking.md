# Mitigation Strategies for screenshot-to-code Integration

## 1. Screenshot Content Validation

**Description:**
- Implement validation service specifically for screenshots submitted to the AI model
- Verify file format matches allowed types for screenshot-to-code (PNG, JPG, WebP)
- Check image dimensions meet the requirements expected by the AI model
- Implement binary file signature verification to confirm MIME type authenticity
- Add preprocessing step to normalize screenshots before sending to AI services
- Prevent screenshot manipulation designed to influence AI code generation

**Threats Mitigated:**
- High severity: Malicious screenshots designed to trigger prompt injection in the AI model
- Medium severity: Specially crafted images intended to generate vulnerable code
- Medium severity: Resource exhaustion through abnormally complex screenshots
- Low severity: Screenshots containing sensitive data that could leak into generated code

**Impact:**
- Significantly reduces risk of AI prompt manipulation through image content
- Prevents potential parser exploits in the screenshot processing pipeline
- Improves reliability of code generation from validated images

**Currently Implemented:**
- Basic file type validation in frontend components
- Simple image preprocessing in the screenshot capture flow

**Missing Implementation:**
- No comprehensive screenshot validation pipeline
- Missing image content analysis before AI processing
- No checks for potentially malicious patterns in screenshots
- Lacking server-side validation of screenshot integrity

## 2. Generated Code Sandboxing

**Description:**
- Create isolated environment specifically for rendering code produced by screenshot-to-code
- Implement Content Security Policy for the code preview component
- Disable potentially dangerous JavaScript APIs in the preview environment
- Add runtime monitoring specific to screenshot-to-code generated content
- Implement DOM purification before rendering the generated HTML/CSS
- Create feature-specific limits on generated code execution

**Threats Mitigated:**
- Critical severity: Execution of malicious code from compromised AI generations
- High severity: Self-XSS through manipulated screenshot inputs
- Medium severity: Data exfiltration through generated code accessing application context

**Impact:**
- Isolates potentially untrusted code generated from screenshots
- Prevents screenshot-to-code outputs from affecting main application
- Significantly reduces XSS risk from AI-generated code

**Currently Implemented:**
- Basic preview functionality without security isolation
- Simple rendering of generated code without sandboxing

**Missing Implementation:**
- No CSP implementation for screenshot-to-code preview component
- Missing iframe sandboxing in code preview functionality
- No isolation between the generated code and application context
- Lacking content sanitization before rendering

## 3. AI Prompt Injection Protections

**Description:**
- Implement sanitization for screenshot-derived content before AI prompt construction
- Create specific prompt templates for screenshot-to-code with parameterized inputs
- Add detection patterns for prompt injection attempts via screenshots
- Implement AI guardrails specific to code generation from images
- Validate AI responses for signs of prompt compromise
- Limit screenshot-to-code prompt context to only essential information

**Threats Mitigated:**
- Critical severity: Model prompt injection leading to malicious code generation
- High severity: Prompt manipulation to extract API keys or sensitive data
- Medium severity: Jailbreaking attempts to generate harmful or vulnerable code

**Impact:**
- Substantially reduces successful prompt injection attacks through screenshots
- Prevents the AI model from being manipulated into creating malicious code
- Limits potential for harmful code generation from the screenshot input

**Currently Implemented:**
- Basic prompt templating in `backend/prompts.py`
- Some hardcoded prompts with minimal parameterization

**Missing Implementation:**
- No specific protections against screenshot-based prompt injection
- Missing validation of screenshot-derived prompt components
- No detection system for prompt manipulation attempts
- Lacking proper parameterization in prompt construction

## 4. Model Output Verification

**Description:**
- Implement pattern-matching to detect malicious code in screenshot-to-code outputs
- Create verification step for common web vulnerabilities in generated HTML/CSS/JS
- Add sanitization pipeline specifically for code generated from screenshots
- Implement staged review process for generated code before execution
- Create allowlists of permitted HTML/CSS features in screenshot-to-code output
- Use secondary validation to verify security of primary model's code generation

**Threats Mitigated:**
- High severity: Hidden malicious code in AI-generated outputs
- High severity: Vulnerable code patterns in generated HTML/CSS/JS
- Medium severity: Insecure coding practices in the generated code

**Impact:**
- Catches potentially harmful code before it reaches the rendering stage
- Provides additional security layer for the AI code generation process
- Reduces likelihood of security flaws in screenshot-to-code outputs

**Currently Implemented:**
- No verification system for AI-generated code in the project

**Missing Implementation:**
- No pattern matching for security issues in generated code
- Missing validation pipeline for screenshot-to-code outputs
- No allowlist filtering for permitted HTML/CSS/JS features
- Lacking security review stage in the generation process

## 5. AI Service Configuration

**Description:**
- Implement server-side proxy specifically for screenshot-to-code AI requests
- Configure minimal-scope API keys dedicated to screenshot-to-code functionality
- Set up usage quotas and rate limiting specific to the screenshot processing feature
- Create request-specific, time-limited tokens for AI API access
- Implement secure handling of API responses containing generated code
- Configure AI temperature and sampling parameters to reduce harmful outputs

**Threats Mitigated:**
- Critical severity: API key exposure through screenshot-to-code requests
- High severity: Excessive API usage through automated screenshot submissions
- Medium severity: AI model abuse to generate harmful content

**Impact:**
- Prevents direct client exposure of AI service credentials
- Significantly reduces risk of API abuse through screenshot-to-code
- Limits potential financial damage from credential theft

**Currently Implemented:**
- Basic environment variable usage for API keys in `backend/main.py`
- Simple configuration of AI providers in environment settings

**Missing Implementation:**
- No server-side proxy pattern for AI service requests
- Missing rate limiting specific to screenshot processing
- No separation of AI credentials by feature
- Lacking secure token generation for API requests
- Missing secure configuration of AI model parameters
