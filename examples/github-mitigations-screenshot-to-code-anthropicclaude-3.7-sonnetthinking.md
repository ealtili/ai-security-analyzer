# Mitigation Strategies for screenshot-to-code

## 1. Server-side API Key Proxy

**Mitigation Strategy**: Implement a server-side proxy service for OpenAI API interactions

**Description**:
1. Create a dedicated backend service that securely stores the OpenAI API key
2. Develop an authenticated endpoint for the frontend to request code generation
3. Pass screenshots from frontend to backend for processing
4. Backend makes the actual OpenAI API calls using the securely stored key
5. Return only the generated code to the frontend

**Threats Mitigated**:
- API key exposure in client-side code (High severity) - Prevents unauthorized access to the OpenAI API key
- API quota theft and abuse (High severity) - Prevents unauthorized users from consuming the service quota
- Financial impact from uncontrolled API usage (Medium severity) - Prevents unexpected billing charges

**Impact**:
- Eliminates direct API key exposure by removing it from client-side code entirely
- Provides centralized control over API interactions
- Enables proper monitoring and rate limiting of API usage

**Currently Implemented**:

**Missing Implementation**:
- Backend proxy service needs to be created
- Secure API key storage on server-side is missing
- Authentication mechanism between frontend and backend is absent
