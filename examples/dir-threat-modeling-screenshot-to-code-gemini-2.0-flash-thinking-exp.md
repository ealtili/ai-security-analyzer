- Threat: API Key Exposure
  - Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to API keys for services like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate, or ScreenshotOne. This could happen through exposed configuration files, insecure storage, or compromised developer environments. With these keys, the attacker can make unauthorized requests to the AI services or screenshot services, potentially incurring financial costs for the application owner, exhausting API quotas, or abusing the services for malicious purposes.
  - Impact: Financial loss due to unauthorized API usage, disruption of service due to quota exhaustion, potential abuse of AI or screenshot services leading to reputational damage or service suspension.
  - Affected component: Backend configuration (config.py, .env files), Frontend settings storage (browser local storage), Screenshot functionality (screenshot.py).
  - Current mitigations: API keys are intended to be stored in environment variables (`.env` files), which are not committed to the repository. Frontend settings, including API keys entered by users, are stored in the browser's local storage, which is client-side only.
  - Missing mitigations: Implement more robust secret management practices, especially for production environments. Consider using a dedicated secret management vault, environment variables in containerized deployments, or backend-for-frontend key proxying to avoid direct exposure of API keys to the frontend. For hosted versions, server-side key management is crucial.
  - Risk severity: High

- Threat: Prompt Injection Attacks
  - Description: An attacker crafts malicious screenshots or video inputs designed to manipulate the AI model's output. By injecting specific commands or instructions within the visual input, the attacker could cause the AI to generate unintended code, bypass intended functionalities, leak sensitive information, or even introduce vulnerabilities into the generated code.
  - Impact: Generation of vulnerable or malicious code, exposure of sensitive information through AI responses, application malfunction or unpredictable behavior, potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the generated code if user-provided content is not properly handled.
  - Affected component: Backend (LLM interaction in llm.py, prompts in prompts directory), Frontend (input handling), Video processing (video/utils.py).
  - Current mitigations: The application relies on the inherent safety measures of the chosen AI models (Claude, GPT, Gemini). There is no explicit input sanitization or output validation implemented in the provided code to prevent prompt injection.
  - Missing mitigations: Implement robust input validation and sanitization techniques to filter potentially malicious visual inputs. Employ prompt hardening strategies to make prompts less susceptible to injection. Validate and sanitize the AI-generated code output before presenting it to the user or using it in further processes to prevent execution of unintended or harmful code. Consider implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential XSS risks from generated code.
  - Risk severity: Medium

- Threat: Exposure of Debugging Artifacts
  - Description: If debugging is enabled (e.g., `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` flag or debug mode in `video/utils.py`), the application writes debug logs and potentially saves screenshots to temporary directories (`DEBUG_DIR`, `tmp_screenshots_dir`). If these directories are inadvertently exposed (e.g., through misconfigured server settings, exposed Docker volumes, or accidental deployment with debug mode enabled), an attacker could gain access to these files. This could lead to information disclosure, including insights into application logic, configurations, user data, API interactions, and potentially visual input data.
  - Impact: Information disclosure of application internals and potentially sensitive data, reverse engineering of application logic, identification of vulnerabilities through debug logs and debugging artifacts, exposure of user screenshots or video frames.
  - Affected component: Backend (DebugFileWriter.py, config.py, video/utils.py).
  - Current mitigations: Debugging features are intended for development and local testing. Debug directories are likely intended to be within the local filesystem and not directly accessible in a production deployment.
  - Missing mitigations: Ensure that debug mode and debugging features are strictly disabled in production deployments. Implement proper access controls and restrict access to debug directories in non-local environments if debugging is necessary. Regularly review and sanitize debug logs to avoid accidental exposure of sensitive information. Implement secure temporary file handling and cleanup to prevent persistent storage of debugging artifacts in production.
  - Risk severity: Medium

- Threat: Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies
  - Description: The application relies on numerous third-party libraries and packages in both the frontend (`package.json`, `yarn.lock`) and backend (`pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`). These dependencies may contain known security vulnerabilities. If these vulnerabilities are not addressed, attackers could exploit them to compromise the application, potentially leading to code execution, denial of service, or data breaches.
  - Impact: Application compromise, denial of service, data breaches, unauthorized access to system resources.
  - Affected component: Backend dependencies (pyproject.toml), Frontend dependencies (package.json).
  - Current mitigations: Dependency management is handled using Poetry for the backend and Yarn for the frontend, which helps in managing and installing dependencies.
  - Missing mitigations: Implement a process for regular dependency vulnerability scanning and updates. Utilize tools like `poetry audit` and `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities. Establish a policy for promptly updating vulnerable dependencies to their patched versions. Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool for continuous monitoring of dependency vulnerabilities.
  - Risk severity: Medium

- Threat: Insecure Operation in Mock Mode
  - Description: The application has a mock mode (`MOCK=true` environment variable) that simulates AI responses using predefined, static outputs from `mock_llm.py`. If mock mode is unintentionally enabled in a production environment, or if these mock responses are not carefully designed, it could lead to several security issues. The application might exhibit unexpected behavior, bypass intended security checks that rely on real AI processing, or expose hardcoded data that could be sensitive or misleading if served in a live setting.
  - Impact: Application malfunction, bypass of intended security logic, serving of incorrect or misleading data to users, potential for denial of service if mock responses are resource-intensive or lead to errors.
  - Affected component: Backend (mock_llm.py, config.py, main.py).
  - Current mitigations: Mock mode is intended for development and debugging purposes, as indicated in `config.py`.
  - Missing mitigations: Enforce strict controls to ensure mock mode is never enabled in production deployments. Implement environment-specific configurations to prevent accidental activation of mock mode in live environments. Clearly document the security implications and intended use case of mock mode to prevent misuse.
  - Risk severity: Medium

- Threat: Unauthorized Access to Evaluation Interface
  - Description: The application includes an evaluation interface accessible via the `/evals` route in the frontend. This interface allows for rating and reviewing the outputs of different AI models and prompts, as described in `Evaluation.md`. If this evaluation interface is not properly secured with authentication and authorization, unauthorized users could access it. This could lead to exposure of evaluation datasets (input screenshots, prompts, model outputs), rating data, and potentially insights into model performance and prompt engineering strategies, which might be considered sensitive or proprietary.
  - Impact: Information disclosure of evaluation data, potential competitive disadvantage if evaluation data is sensitive, unauthorized manipulation of evaluation ratings.
  - Affected component: Frontend (evals route in frontend application), Backend (evals router in routes/evals.py).
  - Current mitigations: There is no explicit mention of access control or authentication for the `/evals` route in the provided files.
  - Missing mitigations: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to the `/evals` interface to authorized personnel only. This is especially critical for hosted versions or any deployment where unauthorized access is a concern. Consider using role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for accessing and modifying evaluation data.
  - Risk severity: Medium

- Threat: Path Traversal in Evaluation Routes
  - Description: The evaluation routes in `evals.py` (`/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, `/best-of-n-evals`) accept folder paths as query parameters. If these paths are not properly validated and sanitized, an attacker could potentially manipulate these parameters to access files and directories outside the intended evaluation data directories. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.
  - Impact: Information disclosure, unauthorized access to server files, potential for further exploitation depending on the files accessed.
  - Affected component: Backend (evals router in routes/evals.py).
  - Current mitigations: The code checks if the provided folder exists using `os.path.exists()`. However, this does not prevent path traversal if the folder path itself is maliciously crafted (e.g., using "../" sequences).
  - Missing mitigations: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for folder paths in the evaluation routes. Use secure path handling techniques to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities, such as using absolute paths, canonicalization, or restricting allowed paths to a whitelist. Avoid directly using user-provided paths in file system operations without proper validation.
  - Risk severity: High
