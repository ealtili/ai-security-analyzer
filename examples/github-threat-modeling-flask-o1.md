## Threat 1: Insecure Use of the Built-in Development Server
- Description: Running Flask’s built-in development server in production (or on an open network) exposes the application to risks. It is not designed for secure, high-concurrency environments and can leak details about the environment if errors occur.
- Impact: Attackers may exploit concurrency limitations, discover internal error messages, or otherwise gain unexpected access to application internals.
- Affected Flask Component: The built-in development server (app.run() in development mode).
- Risk Severity: Medium
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Use a production-ready WSGI server (for example, Gunicorn or uWSGI).
  - Keep the development server strictly for local development.

## Threat 2: Exposed Debug Mode and Interactive Debugger
- Description: Flask’s debug mode provides an interactive debugger that can be used to execute arbitrary code. If debug mode is enabled on a publicly accessible host, attackers can visit the debugger console and run privileged commands.
- Impact: Full compromise of application host, exposure of sensitive environment variables, and data exfiltration.
- Affected Flask Component: Flask debug mode (app.run(debug=True) or FLASK_DEBUG environment variable).
- Risk Severity: High
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Always disable debug mode in production.
  - Ensure environment variables (like FLASK_DEBUG) are set to safe values before deployment.

## Threat 3: Unsigned/Unencrypted Cookie-Based Sessions
- Description: By default, Flask stores session data directly in a client-side cookie which is only signed (to prevent tampering) but not encrypted. If the secret key used for signing is weak or leaked, attackers could forge session data or read sensitive information if stored in the session.
- Impact: Session hijacking, privilege escalation, or manipulation of session-state data.
- Affected Flask Component: Flask’s session management (flask.session).
- Risk Severity: Medium
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Use a secure, random, and unique secret key.
  - Consider server-side session storage or an encrypted session extension.
  - Avoid storing overly sensitive data in the session.

## Threat 4: Jinja2 Template Injection
- Description: Flask uses Jinja2 for templating. If user input is placed into templates without proper safeguards (for example, passing unsanitized data into “{{ }}”), an attacker can craft malicious template expressions that run server-side code.
- Impact: Remote code execution, information disclosure, data exfiltration, and full server compromise.
- Affected Flask Component: Jinja2 template engine integration.
- Risk Severity: High
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Avoid rendering raw user-supplied content within Jinja2 expressions.
  - Use safe filtering functions (like |safe or markupsafe) only when absolutely necessary and after validation.
  - Validate and sanitize all user input before displaying in templates.

## Threat 5: Route Collisions and Blueprint Misconfiguration
- Description: Flask’s blueprint registration and route definitions can unintentionally collide, overriding critical endpoints or exposing unwanted routes. If routes are not carefully managed, attackers may access unprotected or sensitive endpoints.
- Impact: Unauthorized access, overwriting of security-critical routes, or unintended exposure of application functionality.
- Affected Flask Component: Flask’s Blueprint system (flask.Blueprint) and route registration (app.route, blueprint.route).
- Risk Severity: Low
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Use descriptive, non-overlapping blueprint names and URL prefixes.
  - Regularly review route definitions to detect collisions.
  - Confirm expected behavior when multiple blueprints are merged into the main app.

## Threat 6: Race Conditions and Data Leaks in Application Context
- Description: Flask uses a thread-local (or coroutine-local) context for requests. If the application uses shared data structures or misuses request-level globals like request or g in a multi-threaded environment, race conditions or data leakage can occur.
- Impact: Data from one user’s session/context might leak into another’s response or cause unpredictable behavior under load.
- Affected Flask Component: The application and request context mechanism (flask.g, flask.request).
- Risk Severity: Medium
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Ensure that any shared resources are properly synchronized or avoided.
  - Limit the use of request globals in multi-threaded contexts; store user-specific data in safe, isolated structures.
  - If concurrency is high, rigorously test under realistic loads to catch context-related leaks.
