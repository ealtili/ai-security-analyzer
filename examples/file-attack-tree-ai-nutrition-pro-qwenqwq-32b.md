## 1. Understand the Project

### Project Name: AI Nutrition-Pro
### Overview
AI Nutrition-Pro is an application that provides AI-driven nutrition planning services. It integrates with external Meal Planner applications and leverages the ChatGPT-3.5 LLM to generate dietitian-curated content. Key components include an API Gateway (Kong), a Web Control Plane (Golang on AWS ECS), two Amazon RDS databases, and external system interactions via REST/TLS.

### Key Components and Features
- **API Gateway**: Authentication, rate limiting, and input filtering (Kong).
- **Web Control Plane**: Manages client onboarding, configuration, and billing.
- **Control Plane Database**: Stores tenant, billing, and configuration data (Amazon RDS).
- **API Application**: Delivers core AI functionality via REST APIs.
- **API Database**: Stores dietitian content samples and LLM interactions (Amazon RDS).
- **External Systems**: Meal Planner apps (use API keys) and ChatGPT-3.5 (LLM integration).

### Dependencies
- Kong API Gateway, Golang, AWS ECS, Amazon RDS, OpenAI API.

## 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

### High-Risk Paths
1. **Exposed Meal Planner API keys** (Step 4.1): Likely due to insecure coding practices or logging. Easy to exploit for unauthorized access.
2. **SQL injection via API endpoints** (Step 3.1): Critical if input validation is weak, leading to full database compromise.
3. **Weak admin authentication** (Step 2.1): Poor password policies or lack of MFA could grant full control over the system.

### Critical Nodes
- **Meal Planner API key exposure**: Addresses both Steps 4.1 and 4.2.
- **Database input validation**: Mitigates Steps 3.1 and 1.3.
- **Web Control Plane authentication**: Critical for Steps 2.1 and 2.2.

---

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies

1. **API Key Management**:
   - Enforce strict rotation policies and audit key usage.
   - Use IAM roles with least privilege instead of hardcoded keys.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Implement rigorous sanitization (e.g., ORM queries for SQLi prevention).
   - Validate all API parameters using Kong plugins.

3. **Web Control Plane Security**:
   - Mandate MFA for admin accounts.
   - Audit ACL rules and enforce RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

4. **Database Hardening**:
   - Enable AWS RDS encryption and audit logs.
   - Restrict network access to databases via VPC security groups.

5. **ChatGPT Integration Safeguards**:
   - Rotate OpenAI API keys frequently.
   - Sanitize LLM outputs to block malicious content (e.g., phishing templates).

6. **Monitoring**:
   - Set alerts for unusual API activity (e.g., sudden API key usage spikes).

---

## 9. Summarize Findings

### Key Risks Identified
- **Exposed API keys** enable unauthorized access to core services.
- **SQLi vulnerabilities** could lead to full database compromise.
- **Weak admin authentication** risks full system control.

### Recommended Actions
1. Prioritize securing API keys (both Meal Planner and ChatGPT).
2. Harden input validation and database security.
3. Enforce MFA for admins and strict RBAC policies.

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

**Questions**:
- Is the Kong API Gateway patched with the latest security updates?
- Are AWS IAM roles properly restricted to the Control Plane and API databases?

**Assumptions**:
- The Meal Planner apps are developed by third parties; their security practices are out of scope.
- ChatGPT API keys are stored securely, but we assume potential leakage points exist.
