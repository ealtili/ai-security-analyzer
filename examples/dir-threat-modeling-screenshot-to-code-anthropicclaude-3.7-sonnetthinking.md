## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

1. Authentication and Authorization: The code doesn't show any authentication mechanism for the API. Is this intended to be an open API or will authentication be added?

2. Data Retention: How long are user uploads (images/videos) retained? Are they deleted after processing or stored for some period?

3. AI Model Versions: How are AI model versions managed and updated? Are there mechanisms to test new models before deployment?

4. Rate Limiting: Is there any rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse of the API or underlying AI services?

5. External Service Redundancy: Is there any failover mechanism if one AI provider becomes unavailable?

6. Deployment Environment: What specific cloud platform or hosting service is used for the production deployment?

7. CI/CD Implementation: The repository doesn't show CI/CD configuration files. What build and deployment automation is in place?

8. Monitoring and Alerting: What monitoring systems are in place to detect abuse, errors, or security incidents?

9. Screenshot Service Security: What measures are in place to prevent abuse of the screenshot service for scanning internal networks or sensitive sites?

10. Video Processing Limits: Are there limits on video size, duration, or frame count to prevent resource exhaustion?

Assumptions:
- The application is intended for public use, with both open-source and commercial hosted versions
- User uploads are not persistently stored beyond what's needed for processing
- The application doesn't handle user accounts or persistent user data
- The primary security concerns are protecting API keys and preventing abuse of AI services
- The code generation is intended to be safe for end users to use and run
- Temporary files created during processing are cleaned up after use
