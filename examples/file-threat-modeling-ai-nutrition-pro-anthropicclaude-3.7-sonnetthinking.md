## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

1. How is authentication implemented for administrators accessing the Web Control Plane? The threat model assumes basic authentication but multi-factor authentication would be preferable.

3. What kind of monitoring and logging is implemented? The threat model assumes basic logging but recommends comprehensive monitoring.

4. How are API keys managed and rotated? The model assumes manual management but recommends automated rotation.

5. Is there any API request validation beyond what the API Gateway provides? Additional validation in the Backend API would be recommended.

6. How are container images built and what security scanning is performed? The model assumes standard CI/CD practices but recommends comprehensive security scanning.

7. What data retention policies are in place for LLM interactions? The model assumes data is retained but recommends clear policies.

8. How is the ChatGPT API key protected? The model assumes standard secret management but recommends enhanced protection.
