## ASSETS

The following assets require protection within the **Fabric Agent Action** system:

1. **API Keys for LLM Providers**: High sensitivity; unauthorized access could lead to misuse and financial costs.
2. **Source Code and Workflow Configurations**: Medium sensitivity; contains logic and secrets that could be exploited.
3. **User Input Data**: Medium sensitivity; may contain proprietary or confidential information.
4. **Integrity of Automated Workflows**: Ensuring workflows execute correctly without unauthorized modifications.
5. **GitHub Secrets**: Includes sensitive information like API keys and tokens.
6. **Action Execution Environment**: The GitHub Actions Runner where the action executes.
7. **Communication Data with LLM Providers**: Data sent to external LLM services.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES

The trust boundaries within the system are as follows:

1. **User and GitHub Platform**: Boundary between the developer (user) and the GitHub platform.
2. **GitHub Platform and GitHub Actions Runner**: Boundary between the GitHub platform and the runner executing actions.
3. **GitHub Actions Runner and External LLM Provider**: Boundary between the runner (trusted environment) and the external LLM provider's API.
4. **Fabric Agent Action and LLM Provider API**: Boundary when the action communicates with the LLM API.
5. **Public Repositories and External Contributors**: Boundary between the repository and external users (e.g., contributors via pull requests).
6. **GitHub Actions Runner and Internet**: Boundary between the runner and external networks.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

**Questions**:

1. **Authentication Enhancements**: Are additional authentication mechanisms needed beyond GitHub's built-in controls to enhance security?
2. **API Key Management**: How are API keys rotated and managed to minimize the risk of key compromise?
3. **Support for Additional LLM Providers**: Are there plans to support additional LLM providers or self-hosted models for greater flexibility?
4. **Compliance Requirements**: What are the compliance requirements concerning data processing with external LLM services?
5. **Workflow Configuration Guidance**: How are users instructed to properly configure workflow access controls as outlined in the documentation?
6. **Logging Practices**: Are there guidelines on what should and should not be logged to prevent unintentional information disclosure?
7. **Input Validation Mechanisms**: What mechanisms are in place to ensure that user inputs are properly sanitized and validated?

**Assumptions**:
