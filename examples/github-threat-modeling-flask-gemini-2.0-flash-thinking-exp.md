## High and Critical Flask-Specific Threats

Here is a threat list focusing on high and critical severity threats directly related to the Flask framework.

### Threat List:

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into user-controlled input that is directly embedded into Jinja2 templates without proper escaping. When the template is rendered by Flask, the injected code is executed on the server. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining full control of the application and server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breach, denial of service, defacement.
    *   **Flask Component Affected:** Templating (Jinja2, `render_template_string`, `render_template`)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always escape user-provided data** when rendering it in Jinja2 templates.
        *   Utilize Jinja2's autoescaping feature and ensure context-aware escaping.
        *   Avoid using `render_template_string` with user-controlled input if possible.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful SSTI.
        *   Regularly audit templates for potential injection points.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Deserialization
    *   **Description:** If the Flask application uses insecure deserialization methods (like `pickle`) on untrusted data from requests (e.g., cookies, request body), an attacker can craft malicious serialized data. When Flask deserializes this data, it can execute arbitrary code on the server. This is often relevant if using Flask extensions or custom code that handles session data or request parameters using insecure deserialization.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Flask Component Affected:** Potentially Flask extensions or custom code handling data deserialization (e.g., `pickle`, `marshal` if misused), indirectly related to Flask request handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid using insecure deserialization methods like `pickle` for untrusted data.**
        *   If deserialization is necessary, use secure alternatives like JSON or libraries specifically designed for safe deserialization.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* deserialization.
        *   Restrict deserialization to trusted data sources only.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Debug Mode Enabled in Production
    *   **Description:** Running a Flask application with `debug=True` in a production environment exposes sensitive information. Flask's debug mode provides detailed error messages, an interactive debugger, and allows execution of arbitrary code through the debugger console. This information and functionality can be exploited by attackers to gain insights into the application's internals and potentially execute malicious code directly via the debugger.
    *   **Impact:**  Critical information disclosure (source code, configuration, environment variables), remote code execution, complete server compromise.
    *   **Flask Component Affected:** Flask Application (`app.run(debug=True)`)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never run Flask applications in production with `debug=True`.**
        *   Ensure debug mode is explicitly disabled in production configurations (e.g., `debug=False` or environment variable configuration).
        *   Use separate configurations for development and production environments.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Misconfiguration or Bypass
    *   **Description:** An attacker can forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user if CSRF protection provided by Flask extensions like Flask-WTF is not correctly implemented or is bypassed. The attacker tricks the user's browser into sending malicious requests to the Flask application, potentially performing actions without the user's knowledge or consent.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions on behalf of users, data modification, privilege escalation, account takeover.
    *   **Flask Component Affected:** Flask-WTF (CSRF protection), Forms
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable and correctly configure Flask-WTF's CSRF protection.**
        *   Ensure CSRF tokens are included in all forms and AJAX requests that modify server-side state.
        *   Validate CSRF tokens on the server-side for all state-changing requests using Flask-WTF's form validation features.
        *   Use `flask-wtf` form handling and CSRF protection features consistently across the application.
        *   Thoroughly test CSRF protection implementation and ensure it covers all relevant endpoints.
