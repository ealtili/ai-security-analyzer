Okay, here's a draft of the mitigation strategies document, focusing on the threats introduced by the architecture described in `EXAMPLE_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**MITIGATION STRATEGIES**

Here's a breakdown of mitigation strategies tailored to the AI Nutrition-Pro application architecture:

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization for all API Endpoints

    *   **Description:**  Implement strict input validation and sanitization at multiple layers:
        1.  **API Gateway (Kong):**  Use Kong's built-in plugins or custom plugins to validate incoming request parameters, headers, and body content against a predefined schema.  Reject requests that do not conform to the expected format (e.g., incorrect data types, unexpected characters, excessive length).  This should include checks for common attack vectors like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.
        2.  **Backend API (Golang):**  Implement input validation *again* within the Golang application logic.  This provides defense-in-depth.  Use appropriate libraries and functions to sanitize data *before* it is used in any database queries or passed to external systems (like ChatGPT).  This includes escaping special characters, validating data types, and enforcing length limits.  Consider using a dedicated input validation/sanitization library.
        3.  **Control Plane (Golang):** Similar to the Backend API, validate and sanitize all inputs received by the control plane, especially those used in database queries or system configurations.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Prevents malicious SQL code from being injected through API requests and compromising the `API database` or `Control Plane Database`.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):**  While the primary focus isn't a web UI, if any data is ever rendered in a web context, this prevents stored XSS attacks.
        *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting OS commands through the API.
        *   **Data Corruption/Invalid Data (Medium Severity):** Ensures that only valid data is stored in the databases, maintaining data integrity.
        *   **Malicious Input to ChatGPT (Medium Severity):** Prevents crafted prompts designed to elicit undesired or harmful responses from the LLM.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **SQL Injection:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **XSS:** Risk reduced if applicable.
        *   **Command Injection:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Malicious Input to ChatGPT:** Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. The document mentions "filtering of input" at the API Gateway, but details are lacking on the extent and specific mechanisms.  No mention of validation within the Golang applications.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Detailed schema validation at the API Gateway (Kong).
        *   Comprehensive input validation and sanitization within the `Backend API` (Golang) application logic.
        *   Comprehensive input validation and sanitization within the `Web Control Plane` (Golang) application logic.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Communication with ChatGPT (and other External Systems)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Use HTTPS:** Ensure all communication with ChatGPT's API is done over HTTPS (TLS). This is already mentioned in the architecture, but it's crucial to verify the implementation.
        2.  **API Key Protection:** Securely store and manage the API key used to authenticate with ChatGPT.  Do *not* hardcode it in the application code. Use a secure secrets management solution (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).  Rotate the API key regularly.
        3.  **Rate Limiting (ChatGPT):** Implement rate limiting specifically for calls to the ChatGPT API. This prevents abuse and potential cost overruns if the application is compromised.  This can be done at the API Gateway (Kong) or within the `Backend API` logic.
        4.  **Monitor ChatGPT Usage:** Track API usage and costs associated with ChatGPT.  Set up alerts for unusual activity or exceeding predefined thresholds.
        5.  **Validate ChatGPT Responses:** While difficult to fully "validate" LLM responses, implement checks for unexpected content, excessive length, or potentially harmful language.  This is a defense-in-depth measure.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack (High Severity):** HTTPS prevents eavesdropping and tampering with communication between the `Backend API` and ChatGPT.
        *   **API Key Compromise (High Severity):** Secure storage and rotation minimize the impact of a leaked API key.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) / Cost Overruns (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting prevents excessive API usage.
        *   **Malicious/Unexpected Output from ChatGPT (Medium Severity):** Monitoring and basic response validation provide some level of protection.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **MitM Attack:** Risk significantly reduced (assuming proper TLS configuration).
        *   **API Key Compromise:** Impact minimized.
        *   **DoS/Cost Overruns:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Malicious Output:** Risk slightly reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** HTTPS is mentioned.  No mention of API key protection, rate limiting, monitoring, or response validation.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Secure API key storage and management.
        *   Rate limiting for ChatGPT API calls.
        *   Monitoring of ChatGPT usage and costs.
        *   Basic validation of ChatGPT responses.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure API Key Management and Authorization for Meal Planner Applications

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Secure Storage:** Store API keys for Meal Planner applications securely, using a secrets management solution (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).  Do *not* hardcode them.
        2.  **Regular Rotation:** Implement a process for regularly rotating API keys.  This minimizes the impact of a compromised key.
        3.  **Least Privilege:** Ensure that each Meal Planner application's API key only grants access to the specific resources and actions it requires (following the principle of least privilege).  Use Kong's ACL rules effectively.
        4.  **Revocation Mechanism:** Implement a mechanism to quickly revoke API keys if a Meal Planner application is compromised or no longer authorized.
        5.  **Audit Logging:** Log all API key usage, including successful and failed authentication attempts.  Monitor these logs for suspicious activity.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized Meal Planner applications from accessing the API.
        *   **API Key Compromise (High Severity):** Minimizes the impact of a compromised key through rotation and revocation.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Least privilege prevents a compromised application from accessing resources beyond its intended scope.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **API Key Compromise:** Impact minimized.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** The document mentions API key authentication and ACL rules.  No mention of secure storage, rotation, revocation, or audit logging.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Secure storage of API keys.
        *   Regular rotation of API keys.
        *   Mechanism for revoking API keys.
        *   Audit logging of API key usage.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Database Security (Control Plane and API Databases)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Encryption at Rest:** Ensure that both the `Control Plane Database` and `API database` are encrypted at rest.  This protects data if the underlying storage is compromised.  Amazon RDS provides options for encryption.
        2.  **Encryption in Transit:**  Ensure that all communication with the databases is encrypted using TLS. This is mentioned in the architecture, but verify the implementation.
        3.  **Database User Permissions:**  Use separate database users with the least necessary privileges for the `Web Control Plane` and `Backend API`.  Do *not* use a single, highly privileged user for all database operations.
        4.  **Regular Backups:** Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy for both databases.  Test the recovery process regularly.
        5.  **Database Firewall:** Configure the database firewall (e.g., AWS security groups) to allow access *only* from the `Web Control Plane` and `Backend API` instances.  Block all other traffic.
        6.  **Audit Logging:** Enable database audit logging to track all database activity, including successful and failed login attempts, queries, and data modifications.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Encryption at rest and in transit protect data confidentiality.
        *   **Unauthorized Database Access (High Severity):** Least privilege and firewall rules restrict access.
        *   **Data Loss (High Severity):** Backups provide a recovery mechanism.
        *   **Data Tampering (High Severity):** Audit logging helps detect unauthorized modifications.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Breach:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Data Loss:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced (detection capability).

    *   **Currently Implemented:** TLS in transit is mentioned. No mention of encryption at rest, least privilege for database users, backups, firewall configuration, or audit logging.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Encryption at rest for both databases.
        *   Least privilege database user permissions.
        *   Regular, tested database backups.
        *   Database firewall configuration.
        *   Database audit logging.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Deployment and Configuration of AWS Services

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Principle of Least Privilege (IAM):**  Use IAM roles and policies to grant the minimum necessary permissions to the AWS resources used by the application (ECS, RDS, etc.).  Avoid using overly permissive roles.
        2.  **Secure Container Images:**  Use secure base images for Docker containers.  Scan container images for vulnerabilities before deployment.  Regularly update base images and application dependencies to patch security flaws.
        3.  **Network Segmentation (VPC):**  Deploy the application components within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with appropriate subnets and security groups to isolate different tiers of the application (e.g., separate subnets for the API Gateway, Backend API, and databases).
        4.  **Security Hardening:**  Apply security hardening best practices to the operating systems and software running on the ECS instances.
        5.  **Monitoring and Logging (CloudWatch):**  Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor the health and performance of the application and infrastructure.  Configure logging and alerts for security-related events.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Compromise of AWS Resources (High Severity):** Least privilege and network segmentation limit the impact of a compromised component.
        *   **Vulnerable Software (High Severity):** Secure container images and regular updates reduce the risk of known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Network segmentation and security hardening restrict access.
        *   **Delayed Incident Response (Medium Severity):** Monitoring and logging enable timely detection and response to security incidents.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Compromise of AWS Resources:** Impact minimized.
        *   **Vulnerable Software:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Delayed Incident Response:** Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**  The architecture uses AWS services (ECS, RDS), but details on secure configuration are lacking.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Detailed IAM role and policy configuration.
        *   Secure container image practices.
        *   VPC network segmentation.
        *   Security hardening of ECS instances.
        *   Comprehensive monitoring and logging with CloudWatch.
