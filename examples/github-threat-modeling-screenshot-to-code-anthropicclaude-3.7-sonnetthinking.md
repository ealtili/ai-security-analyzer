# Threat Model for Applications Using screenshot-to-code

## Threat 1: AI Prompt Injection via Screenshots
- **Threat**: Attackers could create images with embedded text or visual patterns designed to hijack or manipulate the AI prompt.
- **Description**: Since screenshot-to-code passes images directly to AI models (GPT-4 Vision, Claude, etc.), attackers might embed text in screenshots that override the system's instructions, causing the AI to generate malicious code or bypass security constraints.
- **Impact**: The AI could generate harmful code containing vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious functionality that executes when previewed or deployed.
- **Affected Component**: The AI service integration module that constructs prompts and communicates with external AI APIs.
- **Risk Severity**: Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Strengthen system prompts with explicit instructions to ignore text in images
  - Implement output validation to detect suspicious or malicious code patterns
  - Consider image pre-processing to detect and blur text that might be prompt injection attempts
  - Add monitoring for unusual AI responses that might indicate prompt manipulation

## Threat 2: Unsafe Code Execution in Preview
- **Threat**: Execution of malicious code in the browser preview environment.
- **Description**: The tool renders and executes generated code in the preview pane. If an attacker successfully manipulates the AI to generate malicious JavaScript, this code could execute in the user's browser during preview.
- **Impact**: Cross-site scripting (XSS), data theft, cookie stealing, session hijacking, or other client-side attacks within the user's browser.
- **Affected Component**: The code preview component and iframe implementation.
- **Risk Severity**: High
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Implement a sandboxed iframe with strong Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - Strip potentially dangerous JavaScript functions before rendering
  - Use static rendering instead of executing dynamic JavaScript in previews
  - Add client-side security scanning of generated code before execution

## Threat 3: Exposure of Sensitive Information in Screenshots
- **Threat**: Unintentional transmission of confidential data to third-party AI services.
- **Description**: Users might upload screenshots containing sensitive information (credentials, API keys, personal data, internal business logic) without realizing these images are processed by external AI services.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information to third parties, potential data breaches, or compliance violations.
- **Affected Component**: The screenshot upload pipeline and AI service integration.
- **Risk Severity**: High
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Add clear warnings about how screenshots are processed and where they're sent
  - Implement optional client-side tools to blur/redact sensitive areas
  - Consider using local AI models for processing sensitive content
  - Provide education on what types of screenshots are safe to upload

## Threat 4: API Key Exposure
- **Threat**: Exposure of AI service API keys.
- **Description**: The application requires API keys for services like OpenAI or Anthropic, which could be exposed through insecure storage, client-side code, or logs.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized use of API keys leading to financial losses through unexpected charges, quota exhaustion, or malicious use of the compromised keys.
- **Affected Component**: API key management and configuration.
- **Risk Severity**: High
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Ensure all API requests are proxied through backend services and keys never reach the client
  - Implement proper key rotation policies
  - Use scoped API keys with minimal permissions
  - Monitor API usage for unusual patterns that might indicate key compromise

## Threat 5: Excessive Resource Consumption
- **Threat**: Resource exhaustion attacks through manipulated inputs.
- **Description**: Attackers could upload extremely large or complex images designed to consume excessive computational resources or API quota.
- **Impact**: Denial of service for legitimate users, excessive API costs, or degraded application performance.
- **Affected Component**: The screenshot upload and processing pipeline.
- **Risk Severity**: Medium
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Implement strict file size and dimension limits
  - Add timeouts for AI API calls
  - Implement per-user rate limiting and usage quotas
  - Monitor for unusual patterns of resource usage that might indicate abuse

## Threat 6: Insecure Generated Code
- **Threat**: Security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code.
- **Description**: The AI might generate code with security vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, insecure configurations, or improper input handling, especially when replicating functionality visible in screenshots.
- **Impact**: Deployment of vulnerable code that could lead to security breaches in production environments.
- **Affected Component**: The generated code output from AI models.
- **Risk Severity**: High
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Implement automated security scanning of all generated code
  - Enhance system prompts with security-focused instructions
  - Provide clear warnings that generated code requires security review before production use
  - Develop a library of secure component templates the AI can reference

## Threat 7: Dependency on External AI Services
- **Threat**: Security and availability risks from external service dependencies.
- **Description**: The application relies heavily on third-party AI services that could be compromised, experience outages, or significantly change their APIs or terms of service.
- **Impact**: Service disruption, unexpected behavior changes, or potential security implications if an AI provider is compromised.
- **Affected Component**: AI service integration modules.
- **Risk Severity**: Medium
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Implement graceful degradation for API failures
  - Support multiple AI providers for redundancy
  - Develop fallback mechanisms for critical functionality
  - Monitor for changes in AI provider behavior or API specifications

## Threat 8: Generated Code with Hidden Functionality
- **Threat**: Subtly malicious code that evades detection.
- **Description**: The AI might generate code that appears legitimate but contains hidden functionality that's difficult to detect during review, such as obfuscated malicious code or time-delayed exploits.
- **Impact**: Security breaches that might go undetected for extended periods, data exfiltration, or system compromise.
- **Affected Component**: The generated code output.
- **Risk Severity**: Medium
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Implement multi-stage code review processes combining automated tools and human review
  - Use behavior analysis and dynamic testing of generated code
  - Apply the principle of least privilege when deploying generated code
  - Consider runtime monitoring for unusual behavior in deployed code

## Threat 9: Intellectual Property Violations in Generated Code
- **Threat**: Copyright or license violations in AI-generated code.
- **Description**: The AI models might generate code that too closely resembles copyrighted implementations, especially when processing screenshots of popular websites or applications.
- **Impact**: Potential legal liabilities, copyright claims, or licensing violations for users deploying the generated code.
- **Affected Component**: The code generation algorithms and their outputs.
- **Risk Severity**: Medium
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Include disclaimers about intellectual property responsibility
  - Implement detection for suspiciously close matches to known designs
  - Encourage modification of generated code rather than using it verbatim
  - Provide guidance on appropriate use cases and licensing considerations

## Threat 10: Insecure Server-Side Code Generation
- **Threat**: Generation of vulnerable server-side application code.
- **Description**: If screenshot-to-code generates server-side logic, it might create code with server-side vulnerabilities like command injection, insecure file operations, or improper authentication.
- **Impact**: Server-side security vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution, unauthorized access, or data breaches in deployed applications.
- **Affected Component**: Server-side code generation templates and logic.
- **Risk Severity**: High
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Provide secure templates for server-side code generation
  - Implement specific validation for server-side code
  - Add explicit warnings about the risks of using generated server-side code
  - Consider limiting server-side code generation capabilities

This threat model specifically addresses risks introduced by integrating screenshot-to-code into applications, focusing on the unique security challenges of AI-generated code from images rather than general web application security concerns.
