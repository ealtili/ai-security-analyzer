- **Impact**: Service degradation, increased operational costs, denial of service for legitimate users, potential billing increases for API usage.
- **Component Affected**: The image processing pipeline and AI inference components.
- **Risk Severity**: Medium
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Implement timeouts for processing and code generation
  - Set resource limits for individual requests (memory, processing time)
  - Enforce image size and complexity limitations
  - Implement queue mechanisms to prevent resource hogging by individual users

## Data Exfiltration via Generated Network Requests

- **Threat**: Generation of code that includes unauthorized external network requests.
- **Description**: The AI might generate code that includes fetch requests, WebSocket connections, form submissions, or other means of sending data to third-party servers when rendered in a browser.
- **Impact**: Potential exfiltration of sensitive data when the generated code is executed in a user's browser, leading to data theft.
- **Component Affected**: JavaScript code generation component.
- **Risk Severity**: High
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Analyze generated code for network requests and flag or remove them
  - Implement CSP recommendations that restrict network connections
  - Provide clear warnings when network code is generated
  - Offer sanitized versions of generated code with external network capabilities removed

## Sensitive Information Disclosure

- **Threat**: Screenshots containing sensitive information being processed insecurely.
- **Description**: Users might inadvertently upload screenshots containing sensitive information (credentials, personal data, internal documents), which could be processed, stored, or transmitted insecurely through the tool's workflow.
- **Impact**: Exposure of sensitive information, potential privacy violations, confidentiality breaches, regulatory compliance issues.
- **Component Affected**: Screenshot upload, processing, storage, and AI analysis components.
- **Risk Severity**: High
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Implement clear warnings about not uploading screenshots containing sensitive information
  - Provide tools to redact or blur sensitive areas before processing
  - Minimize data retention periods for uploaded screenshots
  - Ensure secure transmission and storage of screenshots with encryption

## UI Element Misinterpretation Leading to Security Issues

- **Threat**: Misinterpretation of security-critical UI elements in screenshots.
- **Description**: The AI might misinterpret security-critical elements in screenshots (login forms, permission dialogs, payment forms) leading to the generation of code that handles sensitive functionality incorrectly or insecurely.
- **Impact**: Implementation of authentication, authorization, or other security controls that appear correct but contain fundamental security flaws.
- **Component Affected**: Visual interpretation component of the AI model.
- **Risk Severity**: High
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Add specific warnings when security-critical elements are detected in screenshots
  - Provide special handling and additional validation for generated code related to authentication/authorization
  - Offer secure templates for security-critical components rather than generating them from scratch
  - Include clear comments in generated code about security limitations and required review

## Evasion of Content Filters

- **Threat**: Bypassing content moderation systems through visual manipulation.
- **Description**: Attackers might use visual tricks (unusual fonts, image-based text, subtle color variations) to smuggle harmful content past content filters while still being interpreted correctly by the AI.
- **Impact**: Generation of harmful, offensive, or malicious code that evades detection systems.
- **Component Affected**: Content filtering and screenshot analysis components.
- **Risk Severity**: Medium
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Implement multi-layered content filtering (pre-processing, during AI analysis, and post-generation)
  - Regularly update content filters based on new evasion techniques
  - Use image recognition to detect attempts to hide or obfuscate text
  - Implement human review for edge cases or suspicious content

## Adversarial Examples Affecting Code Generation

- **Threat**: Use of adversarial examples to manipulate the AI's visual understanding.
- **Description**: Attackers might craft screenshots with subtle visual perturbations specifically designed to confuse AI vision models, potentially causing them to generate unexpected or malicious code.
