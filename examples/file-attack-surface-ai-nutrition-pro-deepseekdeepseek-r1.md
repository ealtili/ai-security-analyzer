# Attack Surface Analysis for AI Nutrition-Pro

## Attack Surface Identification

### Digital Assets & Entry Points
1. **API Gateway (Kong)**
   - Internet-facing HTTPS/REST interface
   - Vulnerabilities: API key management, ACL rule misconfigurations, potential DDoS exposure
   - Reference: Primary entry point in architecture diagram

2. **Web Control Plane**
   - Admin interface (Golang app in AWS ECS)
   - Vulnerabilities: Privileged access management, potential XSS/CSRF
   - Reference: Accessed by administrators for system configuration

3. **Backend API (Golang app)**
   - Internal HTTPS/REST interface
   - Vulnerabilities: Input validation, ChatGPT integration risks
   - Reference: Communicates with API Gateway and ChatGPT

4. **Databases (Amazon RDS)**
   - Control Plane DB: Tenant/billing data
   - API DB: Dietitian content/LLM interactions
   - Vulnerabilities: Insecure access policies, unencrypted sensitive data
   - Reference: TLS connections mentioned in architecture

5. **External Integrations**
   - Meal Planner Apps (HTTPS/REST)
   - ChatGPT API (HTTPS)
   - Vulnerabilities: Third-party data handling, API key leakage

### Authentication Mechanisms
- API keys for Meal Planner apps (External Docs)
- TLS for all external communications
- AWS ECS/IAM permissions for internal components

## Threat Enumeration (STRIDE Model)

### Spoofing
1. **API Key Compromise**
   - Stolen keys could allow impersonation of Meal Planner apps
   - Vector: API Gateway authentication layer

### Tampering
1. **Data Interception**
   - Manipulation of dietitian samples/LLM requests in transit
   - Vector: Between Backend API and ChatGPT

### Repudiation
1. **Logging Gaps**
   - Missing audit trails for admin actions in Web Control Plane

### Information Disclosure
1. **Database Exposure**
   - Unencrypted PII in RDS instances (if breached)
   - Vector: Control Plane DB/API DB access

### Denial of Service
1. **API Resource Exhaustion**
   - Flooding API Gateway with malicious requests
   - Vector: Internet-facing HTTPS endpoint

### Elevation of Privilege
1. **Admin Credential Theft**
   - Compromised Web Control Plane access
   - Vector: Golang application interface

## Impact Assessment

| Threat               | CIA Impact | Severity | Likelihood | Affected Users     | Business Impact      |
|----------------------|------------|----------|------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| API Key Compromise   | C-I        | Critical | High       | All clients        | Financial/Reputational |
| Database Exposure    | C          | High     | Medium     | Clients/Admins     | Legal/Compliance     |
| Admin Credential     | C-I-A      | Critical | Low        | System-wide        | Full system compromise|
| API DoS              | A          | Medium   | Medium     | Active users       | Service disruption   |
| ChatGPT Data Leakage | C          | High     | Low        | Clients            | Intellectual property|

## Threat Ranking
1. **Critical**
   - API Key Compromise (Easy exploitation path, high business impact)
   - Admin Credential Theft (Full system control potential)

2. **High**
   - Database Exposure (Sensitive data at risk)
   - ChatGPT Data Leakage (IP protection failure)

3. **Medium**
   - API DoS (Mitigated by rate limiting)
   - Data Interception (Requires TLS bypass)

## Mitigation Recommendations

1. **API Security Enhancement**
   - Rotate API keys regularly & implement OAuth 2.0 (Spoofing)
   - Add WAF integration to Kong Gateway (DoS)

2. **Data Protection**
   - Enable RDS encryption-at-rest (Information Disclosure)
   - Implement data sanitization before ChatGPT calls (Tampering)

3. **Access Control**
   - Add MFA for Web Control Plane access (Elevation)
   - Implement RBAC for admin actions (Repudiation)

4. **Monitoring**
   - Add request signing for Meal Planner apps
   - Implement CloudTrail logging for AWS resources

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

### Assumptions
1. API keys are only authentication method for external systems
2. RDS instances use standard AWS security groups
3. No application-level encryption beyond TLS
4. ChatGPT data processing isn't GDPR-compliant by default

### Open Questions
1. Are API keys rotated automatically?
2. Is there input validation for LLM prompts/responses?
3. Are database backups encrypted?
4. What's the retention policy for audit logs?
5. Is there DDoS protection for the API Gateway?
