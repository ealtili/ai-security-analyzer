- Exploit API Key Exposure and Storage (1.1.2)
- Exploit Insecure CORS Configuration (3.1)

### Critical Nodes
- `config.py` (Environment variables and API keys)
- `routes/generate_code.py` (Code generation process)
- `image_processing/utils.py` (Image processing functions)

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies

- **Validate and Sanitize all Environment Variables and API Keys** before usage.
- **Use secure storage methods** for API keys, such as encrypted storage or environment variable vaults.
- **Implement Input Validation** for all user inputs and URL parameters.
- **Restrict CORS Configuration** in both frontend and backend.
- **Implement Secure Image and Video Processing** functions.
- **Validate and Sanitize User Inputs** for code generation.

- **Monitor and Audit** all logs and generate alerts for unusual behavior.


## 9. Summarize Findings

### Key Risks Identified
- Missing validation and exposure of sensitive data through environment variables
- Missing input validation leading to malicious code generation
- Insecure CORS configurations and image/video processing functions

### Recommended Actions
- Implement strict validation and sanitization
- Secure storage and handling of sensitive data
- Restrict CORS and secure image/video processing

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

- **Questions:**
  - Are all the environment variables validated and sanitized?
  - Can the image and video processing functions handle untrusted data securely?
- **Assumptions:**
  - The project relies heavily on AI models and environmental configuration.
  - The code generation and image/video processing functions need to be thoroughly validated.
