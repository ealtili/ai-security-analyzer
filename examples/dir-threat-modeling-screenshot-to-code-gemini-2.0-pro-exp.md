Okay, here's the updated threat model, incorporating the new files (`backend/routes/evals.py`, `backend/routes/generate_code.py`, `backend/routes/home.py`, `backend/routes/screenshot.py`, `backend/video/utils.py`, `backend/ws/constants.py`) and integrating them with the previous threat model. I've maintained the structure, avoided tables, and focused on medium, high, and critical risks.

**Threat Model: screenshot-to-code**

This threat model focuses on the `screenshot-to-code` application, which converts screenshots and videos into code using AI models.

---

**Threats:**

1.  **Threat:** Malicious API Key Usage / Account Takeover
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a user's OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini API key. The attacker could then use the key to make requests to the respective AI service, incurring costs for the legitimate user and potentially accessing other services linked to that account.  The README indicates keys are stored in the browser's local storage, making them potentially vulnerable. The application also supports setting API keys via environment variables, which, if misconfigured, could expose the keys. The `generate_code.py` route handles API keys from both environment variables and the settings dialog.
    *   **Impact:** Financial loss for the user, potential access to other sensitive data associated with the compromised API key, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Backend (`config.py`, `main.py`, `llm.py`, `routes/generate_code.py`), Frontend (where API keys are stored and used).
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The application uses environment variables (`.env` files) and browser local storage, which are standard practices. Instructions are provided for users to obtain and manage their API keys.  `generate_code.py` prioritizes API keys from the settings dialog over environment variables.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement more robust API key management. Consider using a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) instead of relying solely on `.env` files or local storage.
        *   Provide guidance to users on securing their API keys, including regularly rotating keys and setting appropriate usage limits.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual API usage patterns.
        *   Consider implementing session management and authentication, even for the open-source version, to limit the impact of a compromised key.
        *   Encrypt API keys stored in local storage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

2.  **Threat:** Prompt Injection in Image Alt Text
    *   **Description:** The application uses the `alt` text of placeholder images (`https://placehold.co`) to generate images using DALL-E 3 or Replicate. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious screenshot with specially designed `alt` text that, when processed by the image generation models, could lead to undesired behavior, such as generating inappropriate content, or potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in the image generation models themselves.
    *   **Impact:** Generation of inappropriate or offensive content, potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in the image generation models (though this is less likely), denial of service if the generated content triggers safety filters.
    *   **Affected Component:** Backend (`image_generation/core.py`, `image_generation/replicate.py`, `routes/generate_code.py`).
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The application uses placeholder images from a specific domain (`placehold.co`), which limits the scope of user-provided input. The code extracts dimensions from the placeholder URL.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization of the `alt` text before passing it to the image generation models.  This should include whitelisting allowed characters and patterns, and rejecting any input that doesn't conform.
        *   Consider using a proxy or intermediary service to further isolate the image generation process.
        *   Monitor and log image generation requests and responses for suspicious activity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium

3.  **Threat:** Denial of Service via Excessive API Requests
    *   **Description:** An attacker could submit a large number of requests to the application, consuming the user's API key quota and potentially causing a denial of service for legitimate users. This could be done by uploading many screenshots or repeatedly triggering the code generation process. The `generate_code.py` route handles code generation and is a potential target.
    *   **Impact:** Financial loss for the user due to excessive API usage, denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** Backend (`main.py`, `routes/generate_code.py`, `routes/screenshot.py`, `llm.py`).
    *   **Current Mitigations:** None explicitly mentioned in the provided files.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on the API endpoints to restrict the number of requests from a single user or IP address within a given time period. This is especially important for the `/generate-code` WebSocket endpoint.
        *   Implement request validation to ensure that only valid screenshots are processed.
        *   Monitor API usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.
        *   Consider using a queue system to handle requests asynchronously and prevent overload.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

4.  **Threat:** Model Hallucination Leading to Security Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** The AI models (GPT-4 Vision, Claude, Gemini) might "hallucinate" and generate code that contains security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, SQL injection vulnerabilities, or insecure configurations. This is particularly relevant since the application generates functional code, including JavaScript. The `generate_code.py` route is where the code generation happens.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of security vulnerabilities into the generated code, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or other security incidents if the generated code is deployed without careful review.
    *   **Affected Component:** Backend (`llm.py`, `prompts/`, `routes/generate_code.py`), Frontend (generated code).
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The prompts include instructions to the LLMs to pay attention to detail and generate functional code. The project uses well-known libraries like Tailwind, React, and Bootstrap.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement a code review process that includes security analysis of the generated code. This could involve using static analysis tools or manual review by security experts.
        *   Add prompts that specifically instruct the LLM *not* to generate insecure code, and to follow secure coding best practices.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment to execute the generated code and test for vulnerabilities.
        *   Provide clear warnings to users that the generated code should be reviewed and tested before deployment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

5.  **Threat:** Data Leakage via Debugging Information
    *   **Description:** The application includes debugging features that write detailed information to files, including potentially sensitive data like API responses and intermediate code representations. If the `DEBUG_DIR` is misconfigured or exposed, an attacker could gain access to this information.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, including API keys (if present in debug logs), prompt details, and generated code.
    *   **Affected Component:** Backend (`config.py`, `debug/DebugFileWriter.py`).
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` flag controls whether debugging is enabled, and `DEBUG_DIR` specifies the output directory. The debug directory is created with a UUID.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Ensure that the `DEBUG_DIR` is configured to a secure location that is not accessible from the web.
        *   Review the debugging code to ensure that sensitive information, such as API keys, is not logged even when debugging is enabled. Consider redacting or masking sensitive data.
        *   Implement automatic deletion of old debug files after a certain period.
        *   Disable debugging features in production environments.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium

6.  **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** The application relies on numerous third-party libraries (e.g., FastAPI, Uvicorn, OpenAI, Anthropic, React, Tailwind CSS).  Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Impact:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in dependencies could lead to a wide range of impacts, including arbitrary code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Backend (`pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`), Frontend (`package.json`, `yarn.lock`).
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The project uses dependency management tools (Poetry for the backend, Yarn for the frontend) which specify the versions of the dependencies.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Regularly update dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) to identify and track vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Consider using a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to gain visibility into the dependencies and their associated risks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

7.  **Threat:** Exposure of Internal File Paths
    *   **Description:** The `video_to_app.py` script uses hardcoded file paths (`VIDEO_DIR`, `SCREENSHOTS_DIR`, `OUTPUTS_DIR`).  The `evals.py` routes also expose and use file paths for accessing evaluation data. If the application is misconfigured or if an attacker can manipulate input, these paths might be exposed, potentially revealing information about the server's file system structure.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially aiding further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Backend (`video_to_app.py`, `routes/evals.py`).
    *   **Current Mitigations:** None.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding file paths. Use relative paths or configuration variables that are not directly exposed to user input.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization for all parameters that interact with the file system (e.g., `folder`, `folder1`, `folder2` in `evals.py`).  Ensure that user-provided paths are within expected directories and do not contain malicious characters (e.g., "../"). Use path validation libraries.
        *   Implement least privilege principle. The application should run with minimal necessary file system access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium

8.  **Threat:** Insecure Processing of User-Uploaded Videos/Images
    *   **Description:** The application processes user-uploaded videos and images. If not handled securely, this could lead to vulnerabilities such as server-side request forgery (SSRF) or the processing of malicious files. The `image_processing/utils.py` file processes images to meet Claude's requirements, resizing and compressing them. `video/utils.py` processes videos and extracts frames. The `screenshot.py` route uses an external API (screenshotone.com) to capture screenshots, which introduces a dependency on a third-party service.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for SSRF, processing of malicious files, leading to server compromise or data breaches. Dependency on external service availability and security.
    *   **Affected Component:** Backend (`image_processing/utils.py`, `video_to_app.py`, `video/utils.py`, `routes/screenshot.py`).
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The `process_image` function in `image_processing/utils.py` resizes and compresses images, which can mitigate some risks associated with excessively large or malformed images. It checks image dimensions and size. `video/utils.py` limits the number of extracted frames.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Validate the MIME type of uploaded files to ensure they are actually images or videos.
        *   Use a dedicated image and video processing library that is known to be secure against common image/video-based vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider processing images and videos in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement strict size limits for uploaded files.
        *   For the `screenshot.py` route, consider implementing a fallback mechanism in case the external screenshot service is unavailable. Monitor the external service for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Sanitize filenames generated from user input or timestamps to prevent potential path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

9. **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Evaluation Endpoints
    *   **Description:** The `routes/evals.py` file defines several endpoints (`/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, `/run_evals`, `/models`, `/best-of-n-evals`) that allow for running and viewing evaluations.  These endpoints do not appear to have any authentication or authorization mechanisms, potentially allowing anyone with access to the backend to run evaluations or view evaluation results.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to evaluation data, potential manipulation of evaluation results, and potential resource exhaustion if the `/run_evals` endpoint is abused.
    *   **Affected Component:** Backend (`routes/evals.py`).
    *   **Current Mitigations:** None.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement authentication and authorization for the evaluation endpoints. This could involve requiring an API key, user login, or other access control mechanisms.
        *   Implement rate limiting on the `/run_evals` endpoint to prevent abuse.
        *   Consider restricting access to these endpoints based on IP address or network location.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

10. **Threat:** WebSocket Connection Hijacking / Man-in-the-Middle
     * **Description:** The `/generate-code` endpoint uses WebSockets for communication. If the connection is not secured (using WSS instead of WS), an attacker could potentially intercept or modify the data transmitted between the client and server. This could expose sensitive information like the generated code, prompt details, or even API keys if they are transmitted over the WebSocket.
     * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential modification of generated code, leading to security vulnerabilities or incorrect functionality.
     * **Affected Component:** Backend (`routes/generate_code.py`).
     * **Current Mitigations:** None explicitly mentioned. The code uses `await websocket.accept()`, which *should* handle the upgrade to WSS if the client initiates a secure connection, but this is not enforced.
     * **Missing Mitigations:**
         *   Enforce the use of secure WebSockets (WSS) by rejecting insecure (WS) connections. This can typically be done at the web server or reverse proxy level (e.g., Nginx, Apache).
         *   Ensure that the client-side code also uses WSS to connect to the backend.
         *   Consider implementing additional security measures, such as using a token-based authentication system for WebSocket connections.
     * **Risk Severity:** High

11. **Threat:** SSRF via Screenshot API
    *   **Description:** The `/api/screenshot` endpoint takes a URL as input and uses an external API (screenshotone.com) to capture a screenshot. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious URL, causing the backend server to make requests to internal systems or other unintended targets.
    *   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), potentially allowing the attacker to access internal resources, scan internal networks, or exploit vulnerabilities in other services.
    *   **Affected Component:** Backend (`routes/screenshot.py`).
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The code uses a specific API endpoint (`https://api.screenshotone.com/take`) and passes the target URL as a parameter.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement a strict allowlist of allowed domains for the `url` parameter. Only permit screenshots of known, trusted websites.
        *   Consider using a dedicated SSRF prevention library or technique.
        *   Do not allow the user to control the full URL passed to the screenshot API.
        *   Monitor and log all requests made to the external screenshot API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
---

This updated threat model incorporates the new files and provides a more comprehensive assessment of the application's security posture. It is crucial to address the identified threats, especially those with high and critical severity, to ensure the security and integrity of the `screenshot-to-code` application.
