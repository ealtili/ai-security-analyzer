Here is the combined list of vulnerabilities, formatted as markdown with main paragraphs and subparagraphs for each vulnerability:

### Vulnerability Report

- **Vulnerability Name:** Information Disclosure via Debug Logs

- **Description:**
    - Step 1: An attacker identifies that the application might be running in debug mode in a production environment. This could be inferred through error messages, verbose logging, or by observing unexpected behavior that suggests debugging features are active.
    - Step 2: The attacker attempts to access the debug directory, potentially by guessing common debug directory names or by identifying the configured `DEBUG_DIR` through misconfiguration (if exposed). For example, if `DEBUG_DIR` is set to `/tmp/debug-logs` and the web server configuration exposes `/tmp` directory, the attacker could try to access `/debug-logs`.
    - Step 3: If the debug directory is accessible via the web server, the attacker can browse and download debug log files. These files, as written by `DebugFileWriter.py`, contain generated HTML code and the "thinking process" of the LLM. This "thinking process" could reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings, prompts used, and potentially snippets of user-provided data processed by the LLM.

- **Impact:**
    - Exposure of generated HTML code: This might not be critical on its own, but could reveal details about the application's functionality and structure that an attacker could use to find other vulnerabilities.
    - Exposure of LLM "thinking process": This is more serious as it could reveal the prompts used to interact with the LLMs, internal logic of the application, and potentially expose details about how user inputs are processed and sent to the LLMs. This information can be leveraged to craft more targeted attacks, including prompt injection attacks (though prompt injection is not a direct vulnerability of *this* application as per instructions, understanding the prompts is still valuable for attackers).
    - Depending on the content of the debug logs and the application's context, more sensitive information might be unintentionally logged and exposed.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The code checks `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` in `DebugFileWriter.__init__` to determine if debug logging should be active.
    ```python
    class DebugFileWriter:
        def __init__(self):
            if not IS_DEBUG_ENABLED:
                return
    ```
    - This mitigation depends on the `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` environment variable being correctly set to `False` in production environments.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Ensure `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` is always `False` in production:** The primary missing mitigation is a robust deployment process that guarantees `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` is set to `False` in production. This could involve infrastructure-as-code, configuration management, or CI/CD pipelines with environment-specific configurations.
    - **Restrict web server access to debug directory:** Even if debug mode is accidentally enabled, the web server should be configured to prevent public access to the `DEBUG_DIR`. This is a crucial security measure. Web server configuration (like Nginx or Apache) should explicitly deny access to this directory.
    - **Securely manage `DEBUG_DIR` location:** The `DEBUG_DIR` should be located outside the web server's document root and in a location that is not easily guessable.
    - **Regularly review and sanitize debug logs:** Implement processes to regularly review debug logs and ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently being logged. Consider log sanitization techniques to remove or mask sensitive data before it's written to logs.
    - **Consider removing debug logging in production builds:** For enhanced security, consider conditional compilation or build processes that completely remove debug logging code from production builds instead of relying solely on a configuration flag.

- **Preconditions:**
    - `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` environment variable is set to `True` in the production environment.
    - The web server is configured to serve files from the `DEBUG_DIR` or a parent directory, making the debug logs accessible via HTTP requests.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File: `backend\config.py`**
        ```python
        IS_DEBUG_ENABLED = bool(os.environ.get("IS_DEBUG_ENABLED", False))
        DEBUG_DIR = os.environ.get("DEBUG_DIR", "")
        ```
        - `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` is controlled by the `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` environment variable, defaulting to `False`.
        - `DEBUG_DIR` is controlled by the `DEBUG_DIR` environment variable, defaulting to an empty string, which might resolve to the current working directory depending on how `os.path.expanduser` is used.

    - **File: `backend\debug\DebugFileWriter.py`**
        ```python
        import os
        import logging
        import uuid

        from config import DEBUG_DIR, IS_DEBUG_ENABLED


        class DebugFileWriter:
            def __init__(self):
                if not IS_DEBUG_ENABLED:
                    return

                try:
                    self.debug_artifacts_path = os.path.expanduser(
                        f"{DEBUG_DIR}/{str(uuid.uuid4())}"
                    )
                    os.makedirs(self.debug_artifacts_path, exist_ok=True)
                    print(f"Debugging artifacts will be stored in: {self.debug_artifacts_path}")
                except:
                    logging.error("Failed to create debug directory")

            def write_to_file(self, filename: str, content: str) -> None:
                try:
                    with open(os.path.join(self.debug_artifacts_path, filename), "w") as file:
                        file.write(content)
                except Exception as e:
                    logging.error(f"Failed to write to file: {e}")

            def extract_html_content(self, text: str) -> str:
                return str(text.split("<html>")[-1].rsplit("</html>", 1)[0] + "</html>")
        ```
        - The `DebugFileWriter` class is responsible for writing debug information to files.
        - The `__init__` method checks `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED`. If `False`, it effectively disables debug logging.
        - If `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` is `True`, it creates a directory using `DEBUG_DIR` and a UUID.
        - `write_to_file` method writes content to a file within the debug directory.
        - `extract_html_content` method extracts HTML, which suggests HTML code is being logged.

    - **File: `backend\llm.py`**
        ```python
        from debug.DebugFileWriter import DebugFileWriter
        # ...
        debug_file_writer = DebugFileWriter()
        # ...
        if IS_DEBUG_ENABLED:
            debug_file_writer.write_to_file(
                f"pass_{current_pass_num - 1}.html",
                debug_file_writer.extract_html_content(response_text),
            )
            debug_file_writer.write_to_file(
                f"thinking_pass_{current_pass_num - 1}.txt",
                response_text.split("</thinking>")[0],
            )
        ```
        - In `stream_claude_response_native` function, if `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` is true, `DebugFileWriter` is used to write HTML code and thinking process to files.

    - **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Request to Backend] --> B{IS_DEBUG_ENABLED == True?};
        B -- Yes --> C[DebugFileWriter Created];
        B -- No --> NoDebug[No Debug Logging];
        C --> D{stream_claude_response_native};
        D -- During LLM Stream --> E[DebugFileWriter.write_to_file (HTML & Thinking)];
        E --> F[Debug Logs in DEBUG_DIR];
        F --> G[Web Server Serves DEBUG_DIR?];
        G -- Yes --> H[Information Disclosure Vulnerability];
        G -- No --> NoVuln[No Vulnerability (in this path)];
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    - Step 1: Deploy the `screenshot-to-code` application in a test environment, ensuring that `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED=True` environment variable is set. Configure the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to serve the directory specified by `DEBUG_DIR` (e.g., `/tmp/debug-logs`) at a publicly accessible URL path, for example, `/debug-logs`.
    - Step 2: Use the application to convert a screenshot to code. This will trigger the debug logging in `llm.py`.
    - Step 3: As an external attacker, try to access the debug log directory through the web browser by navigating to the configured URL path (e.g., `http://<your-app-domain>/debug-logs`).
    - Step 4: If directory listing is enabled, you should see a list of directories corresponding to UUIDs created by `DebugFileWriter`.
    - Step 5: Enter one of the UUID directories. You should see files like `pass_1.html`, `thinking_pass_1.txt`, `full_stream.txt`.
    - Step 6: Open and examine the content of these files. Verify that they contain generated HTML code and the thinking process of the LLM, confirming information disclosure.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Directory Traversal in Evals Routes

- **Description:**
    - Step 1: An attacker identifies the `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, or `/best-of-n-evals` endpoints.
    - Step 2: The attacker crafts a malicious request to one of these endpoints, providing a manipulated `folder`, `folder1`, `folder2`, etc. query parameter containing directory traversal sequences like `../` to access directories outside of the intended evaluation directory.
    - Step 3: The backend application uses `os.listdir` and `os.path.join` to process files within the user-provided folder path without proper sanitization or validation.
    - Step 4: If successful, the attacker can read files and directories outside the intended evaluation directory, potentially gaining access to sensitive information, application code, or configuration files.

- **Impact:**
    - Information Disclosure: Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server file system that the application has access to. This could include source code, configuration files, environment variables, or other sensitive data.
    - Potential for further exploitation: Depending on the server configuration and accessed files, directory traversal can be a stepping stone for more severe attacks like Remote Code Execution (if they can access configuration files with credentials or upload files - although upload functionality is not directly visible in provided files).

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None in the provided code. The application checks if the folder exists using `folder_path.exists()`, but not if the path is within allowed boundaries or sanitized against directory traversal.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  The application must validate and sanitize the `folder` parameters in `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, and `/best-of-n-evals` endpoints to prevent directory traversal. This should include:
        - Whitelisting allowed base directories for evaluations.
        - Using secure path manipulation functions that prevent traversal outside of the intended directories (e.g., `os.path.abspath` and checking if it starts with the allowed base path).
        - Rejecting paths containing directory traversal sequences like `../`.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application process runs with minimal necessary privileges to reduce the impact of a successful directory traversal attack.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must be running and accessible to external attackers.
    - The attacker must be able to send HTTP GET requests to the `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, or `/best-of-n-evals` endpoints.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File: `backend\routes\evals.py`**
        - **`get_evals` function:**
            ```python
            @router.get("/evals", response_model=list[Eval])
            async def get_evals(folder: str):
                if not folder:
                    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Folder path is required")

                folder_path = Path(folder)
                if not folder_path.exists():
                    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=f"Folder not found: {folder}")

                try:
                    evals: list[Eval] = []
                    # Get all HTML files from folder
                    files = {
                        f: os.path.join(folder, f)
                        for f in os.listdir(folder)
                        if f.endswith(".html")
                    }
                    # ... rest of the code
            ```
            - The `folder` parameter from the query is directly used in `os.path.join` and `os.listdir` without any sanitization. An attacker can inject `../` sequences in the `folder` parameter to traverse directories.
        - **`get_pairwise_evals` and `get_best_of_n-evals` functions:** These functions have similar code patterns and are also vulnerable as they process `folder1`, `folder2` etc. parameters in the same insecure way.

- **Security Test Case:**
    - Step 1: Deploy the application in a test environment.
    - Step 2: As an external attacker, craft a malicious GET request to `/evals` endpoint with a directory traversal payload in the `folder` parameter. For example: `http://<your-app-domain>/evals?folder=../../backend/config.py` (assuming `backend/config.py` is outside the intended eval directory).
    - Step 3: Send the request and observe the response.
    - Step 4: If the vulnerability exists, the response body might contain an error because it tries to process `config.py` as an HTML file, or it might list files from the directory where `config.py` is located, or in some cases, if the web server is configured to serve static files, it might even serve the content of `config.py` directly if it's in a served directory. A successful test would be if you can observe access to files or directories outside the expected evaluation directory.
    - Step 5: Try to access sensitive files like application configuration files to confirm information disclosure. For example: `http://<your-app-domain>/evals?folder=../../backend/config.py`.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Overly Permissive CORS Policy
  - **Description:**
    The backend is configured with FastAPI’s CORSMiddleware using an “allow all” policy (using `allow_origins=["*"]`, `allow_methods=["*"]`, and `allow_headers=["*"]`). An attacker can build a malicious web page that sends cross‑origin AJAX requests to all backend endpoints. In a scenario where sensitive data or functions are exposed by these endpoints, the attacker could have the victim’s browser send authenticated requests (especially given that credentials are allowed) and read the responses.
    Steps to trigger:
      1. The attacker hosts a malicious page on a domain they control.
      2. Using JavaScript, they send an AJAX request (with credentials) to one of the backend endpoints (for example, a code‐generation or screenshot endpoint).
      3. Because the server responds with permissive CORS headers, the browser makes the response available to the attacker’s script.
  - **Impact:**
    Sensitive responses may be read by an attacker’s site (if any endpoints later deal with private data or administrative actions), exposing internal state or enabling misuse of APIs.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The project does enforce CORS via FastAPI middleware—but with a wildcard setting that allows any origin.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    In production environments the list of allowed origins should be restricted to only those domains that need access. Additionally, tighter permissions for credentials and methods could be enforced.
  - **Preconditions:**
    The backend must be publicly accessible.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    In `backend/main.py` the following middleware is added:
    ```python
    app.add_middleware(
        CORSMiddleware,
        allow_origins=["*"],
        allow_credentials=True,
        allow_methods=["*"],
        allow_headers=["*"],
    )
    ```
    This setting causes every origin to be allowed access.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a simple HTML page on an attacker‑controlled domain that uses JavaScript (e.g., using XMLHttpRequest or fetch with credentials).
    2. Request a backend endpoint (e.g., `/api/screenshot` or `/generate-code`) from this page.
    3. Verify that the browser allows the response to be read (inspect using developer tools) even though the request is cross‑origin.
    4. Conclude that the overly permissive CORS configuration is in effect.

- **Vulnerability Name:** SSRF via the Screenshot Endpoint
  - **Description:**
    The `/api/screenshot` endpoint in `routes/screenshot.py` accepts a URL provided by the client without any sanitization or whitelisting. This URL is passed directly as a parameter (named `url`) to an external API (ScreenshotOne) via an HTTP GET call using httpx.
    Steps to trigger:
      1. An attacker submits a POST request with the JSON payload containing a malicious target URL (for example, an internal URL such as `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` or a resource on the private network).
      2. The backend’s `capture_screenshot()` function uses this URL as-is when calling the screenshot API.
  - **Impact:**
    The attacker might use the backend as a proxy to scan internal resources, access sensitive internal endpoints, or otherwise abuse the screenshot API with unintended target URLs. In some scenarios this may even result in a disclosure of sensitive internal information.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    There is no input validation or URL whitelisting in the code for the `target_url` parameter.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    The application should validate that the URL points only to allowed (and public) domains. Implementing a whitelist of domains or a validation routine would mitigate this risk.
  - **Preconditions:**
    The screenshot endpoint is publicly accessible and accepts arbitrary URLs within its payload.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    In `routes/screenshot.py`:
    ```python
    class ScreenshotRequest(BaseModel):
        url: str
        apiKey: str
    ...
    async def capture_screenshot(target_url: str, api_key: str, device: str = "desktop") -> bytes:
        params = {
            "access_key": api_key,
            "url": target_url,
            ...
        }
        async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=60) as client:
            response = await client.get(api_base_url, params=params)
            ...
    ```
    There is no sanitization or validation of `target_url` before it is used.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Use a tool (for example, curl or Postman) to POST to `/api/screenshot` with a JSON body such as:
       ```json
       {
         "url": "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/",
         "apiKey": "dummy-key"
       }
       ```
    2. Observe if the response contains data that indicates an internal resource was accessed (or if the external API error message reveals internal endpoints).
    3. If so, the SSRF risk is confirmed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Handling and Transmission of API Keys in Code Generation
  - **Description:**
    The code‑generation endpoint (implemented over a WebSocket in `routes/generate_code.py`) accepts API keys such as OpenAI and Anthropic keys in the client’s payload. These keys are then used in subsequent calls to third‑party LLM endpoints. An attacker controlling the WebSocket connection or intercepting traffic (if not transported over TLS) could supply, misuse, or exfiltrate these keys.
    Steps to trigger:
      1. An attacker opens a WebSocket connection to `/generate-code` and sends a JSON payload that supplies API key values through parameters (for instance, using keys `"openAiApiKey"` or `"anthropicApiKey"`).
      2. The server uses these keys without additional protection, meaning that an attacker could provide a key they control or capture keys transmitted by a victim if the connection isn’t secured.
  - **Impact:**
    Misuse of the LLM service API keys can result in unauthorized API calls (incurring cost and potential data leakage) and may expose sensitive credentials that could be abused elsewhere.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The code provides a fallback to environment‑configured keys when available. However, it still accepts API keys from client‑supplied parameters without further checks.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    Implement strict authentication for API key submission and ensure that keys are only accepted over a secure (TLS‑protected) channel. Ideally, API keys for third‑party services should not be user‑supplied from untrusted origins.
  - **Preconditions:**
    The WebSocket connection is established by an unauthenticated (or lightly authenticated) client, and API keys are sent in plaintext (if TLS is not enforced).
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    In `routes/generate_code.py`, the function `extract_params()` calls:
    ```python
    openai_api_key = get_from_settings_dialog_or_env(params, "openAiApiKey", OPENAI_API_KEY)
    ```
    and similarly for Anthropic. There is no additional verification of these keys received from the client before they are used for making API calls.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Establish a WebSocket connection to the backend’s `/generate-code` endpoint.
    2. Send a JSON payload that includes a deliberately invalid or attacker‑controlled API key.
    3. Monitor if the key is used in making outbound calls and if any sensitive error messages or confirmations are returned via the WebSocket.
    4. Additionally, verify (using network monitoring) that the connection data is encrypted (e.g. via TLS) so that API keys are not sent in cleartext.

---

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unsanitized HTML Output Leading to Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS)
  - **Description:**
    After receiving a response from a language model, the backend calls a helper function to extract the HTML content (using a regular expression) and then transmits this code via the WebSocket to be rendered by the client. If an attacker can manipulate the prompt (or trigger an LLM output) so that the generated HTML contains malicious JavaScript (e.g. `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`), and if the front‑end renders this HTML without further sanitization, then client‑side script execution will follow.
    Steps to trigger:
      1. An attacker submits a prompt (or intercepts and slightly modifies the conversation) so that the LLM returns HTML that includes a malicious `<script>` tag.
      2. The backend extracts the HTML and sends it to the front‑end.
      3. The front‑end injects or displays this HTML directly in the DOM, leading to execution of the malicious code.
  - **Impact:**
    Successful XSS may allow session hijacking, defacement, redirection to phishing sites, or further exploitation of the client’s browser context.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The code uses a simple regex in `extract_html_content()` (in `codegen/utils.py`) to pick out the first `<html>…</html>` block. There is no output sanitization or XSS filtering applied thereafter.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    The system should sanitize and/or escape any potentially dangerous HTML or JavaScript in the generated output before it is rendered on the client side.
  - **Preconditions:**
    The attacker is able to influence the LLM prompt or the request parameters (contributing to the LLM’s output) and the front‑end renders the result without sanitization.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    In `routes/generate_code.py`:
    ```python
    completions = [extract_html_content(completion) for completion in completions]
    ...
    await send_message("setCode", updated_html, index)
    ```
    The helper `extract_html_content()` simply uses:
    ```python
    re.search(r"(<html.*?>.*?</html>)", text, re.DOTALL)
    ```
    which does not alter any embedded `<script>` tags.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Submit a prompt (via the code generation WebSocket API) crafted to elicit an LLM response containing malicious code (for example, include instructions such as “inject a script that calls `alert('XSS')`”).
    2. When the response is rendered on the front‑end, observe if the script executes (using a test browser or simulated client).
    3. Confirm that without output filtering, the malicious JavaScript runs in the client’s browser.

---

- **Vulnerability Name:** Prompt Injection via Unsanitized User‑Provided Inputs
  - **Description:**
    The process of assembling prompts (in `prompts/__init__.py` functions such as `assemble_prompt()` and `create_prompt()`) directly incorporates user‑supplied parameters (like image URLs and history messages) into the prompt without any sanitization. An attacker may craft history messages or other input fields that include additional instructions or control characters. This could manipulate the context given to the LLM and steer it to generate harmful or unintended output.
    Steps to trigger:
      1. An attacker submits a “history” array in the WebSocket payload containing unexpected HTML or LLM‑control text (e.g. injecting additional system instructions or malicious directives).
      2. The assembled prompt then includes these injections which may cause the LLM to leak sensitive configuration information or output harmful HTML/JS.
  - **Impact:**
    Manipulated prompt output may result in arbitrary code generation, facilitate XSS indirectly, or cause the disclosure of internal system details.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The prompt construction code does not appear to perform any sanitization or validation of the user‑supplied “history” or “image” parameters.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    The application must enforce strict input validation and sanitize prompt components (for example, by escaping HTML/JavaScript, enforcing length limits, and/or whitelisting allowed characters) before these values are concatenated into the prompt.
  - **Preconditions:**
    The client is permitted to send arbitrary “history” or other prompt‑related data without prior filtering and the LLM is sensitive to prompt changes.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    In `prompts/__init__.py`, the function `create_prompt()` directly appends messages from `params["history"]` into the prompt messages without sanitization. This makes the prompt susceptible to injection attacks.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Submit a request that includes a “history” array with crafted input such as:
       ```
       "</script><script>alert('injection')</script>"
       ```
    2. Monitor the assembled prompt (or the eventual LLM output) to see if the malicious payload is present or if it alters the expected behavior.
    3. Validate that, without proper sanitization, the attacker’s payload is injected into the prompt.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Information Disclosure Through Detailed Error Messages on WebSocket
  - **Description:**
    In the code generation route implemented over a WebSocket (`routes/generate_code.py`), when errors occur (for example, authentication errors from OpenAI or rate–limit errors) detailed exception messages and stack traces may be printed to the console and sent back to the client. An attacker can trigger error conditions (for example, by supplying invalid API keys) and receive detailed information about internal workings, configurations, or even file paths.
    Steps to trigger:
      1. An attacker opens a WebSocket connection to `/generate-code` and supplies invalid or deliberately bad parameters.
      2. The backend encounters an exception (such as `openai.AuthenticationError` or `openai.RateLimitError`) and calls `throw_error()`, sending error details over the WebSocket.
  - **Impact:**
    Revealing stack traces and detailed internal error messages can provide attackers with valuable insight into the system’s internal structure and logic, which they could leverage in further attacks.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The code does catch some exceptions and calls `throw_error()`; however, the error messages (including exception messages) are relayed directly to the client.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    The error responses should be sanitized to remove any technical details (or use generic error messages) rather than sending detailed exception information back to the client.
  - **Preconditions:**
    The attacker can force error paths (for example, via invalid keys or malformed payloads) and the WebSocket connection is not authenticated or encrypted.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    In `routes/generate_code.py`, when exceptions such as `openai.AuthenticationError` or `openai.RateLimitError` occur, the code uses:
    ```python
    await throw_error(error_message)
    ```
    where `error_message` is constructed directly from exception messages (and sometimes includes technical details).
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Open a WebSocket connection to the `/generate-code` endpoint using a test client.
    2. Supply purposely invalid API key parameters so that an authentication error is triggered.
    3. Capture the error message sent back over the WebSocket and inspect it for internal details (such as specific exception types or stack information).
    4. Verify that error messages do not provide more information than a user‑friendly “Something went wrong” message.
