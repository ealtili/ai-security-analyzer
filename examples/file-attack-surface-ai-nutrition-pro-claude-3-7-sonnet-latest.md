# AI Nutrition-Pro Attack Surface Analysis

Based on the architecture provided, I've identified several key attack surfaces that pose significant risk to the AI Nutrition-Pro application. This analysis focuses on medium to critical severity attack surfaces introduced by the application design.

## API Gateway Attack Vectors

- **Description**: The Kong API Gateway serves as the entry point for external Meal Planner applications and could be vulnerable to authentication bypass, rate limiting evasion, or input filter bypass attacks.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: Exposes public-facing APIs with authentication and filtering mechanisms that present an attack surface.

- **Example**: Attackers could attempt API key theft, brute force attacks, or crafting malicious inputs designed to bypass filtering.

- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to API functionality, potential denial of service, or exploitation of backend systems.

- **Risk Severity**: High

- **Current Mitigations**: Authentication with individual API keys for each Meal Planner application, input filtering, rate limiting, and ACL rules. These reduce the severity but the gateway remains a primary attack vector.

- **Missing Mitigations**: Implement robust API key rotation policies, advanced request validation, proper API versioning, and additional threat detection at the gateway layer.

## LLM Prompt Injection

- **Description**: Attackers could craft malicious inputs that manipulate the ChatGPT LLM to generate harmful or unauthorized content.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: The application sends dietitian content samples to the LLM for content generation without clear validation controls.

- **Example**: An attacker could inject prompts that instruct the LLM to generate harmful dietary advice or extract information about other users or system internals.

- **Impact**: Generation of dangerous nutritional guidance, potential data leakage, or system information disclosure.

- **Risk Severity**: Critical

- **Current Mitigations**: Basic input filtering at API Gateway, but no specific LLM prompt security controls are mentioned.

- **Missing Mitigations**: Implement specialized prompt sanitization, security boundaries in LLM prompts, output validation before returning results, and content safety filters.

## Sensitive Data Exposure

- **Description**: The databases store sensitive information including dietitian content, LLM interactions, and client billing data.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: The application stores potentially sensitive nutritional advice, proprietary content samples, and client management data.

- **Example**: A database breach could expose confidential client information, proprietary dietitian content, or financial details.

- **Impact**: Privacy violations, intellectual property theft, potential regulatory compliance issues.

- **Risk Severity**: High

- **Current Mitigations**: TLS for database connections, which addresses data in transit but not data at rest.

- **Missing Mitigations**: Implement database encryption at rest, data access controls, database activity monitoring, data minimization and retention policies.

## Control Plane Security Vulnerabilities

- **Description**: The Web Control Plane provides administrative functionality that could be targeted for privileged access.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: Provides administrative interfaces for system configuration, client management, and billing data access.

- **Example**: An attacker gaining access to the control plane could modify system configurations, access billing data, or add malicious clients.

- **Impact**: System compromise, unauthorized access to tenant data, financial fraud.

- **Risk Severity**: High

- **Current Mitigations**: No specific security controls for the control plane are mentioned beyond standard authentication.

- **Missing Mitigations**: Implement multi-factor authentication, role-based access control, privileged access management, admin session security, and activity logging.

## Multi-tenant Isolation Failures

- **Description**: The system likely serves multiple Meal Planner applications, creating risks of cross-tenant data access.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: The architecture suggests a multi-tenant model where isolation failures could allow data leakage between clients.

- **Example**: A vulnerability in the authorization model could allow one Meal Planner application to access another's diet content or user data.

- **Impact**: Data breaches, privacy violations, reputational damage.

- **Risk Severity**: High

- **Current Mitigations**: ACL rules in API Gateway provide some tenant isolation, but comprehensive protection is not detailed.

- **Missing Mitigations**: Implement robust tenant isolation at all layers, tenant-specific encryption, thorough tenant authorization checks, and tenant access auditing.

## LLM Output Validation

- **Description**: The system lacks validation of LLM-generated content, which could contain incorrect or harmful nutritional advice.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: Relies on LLM-generated content for nutrition guidance without clear validation procedures.

- **Example**: ChatGPT might generate nutritionally dangerous advice for individuals with specific health conditions or allergies.

- **Impact**: Potential health risks to end users receiving nutrition guidance, liability concerns.

- **Risk Severity**: High

- **Current Mitigations**: No specific content validation measures are mentioned in the architecture.

- **Missing Mitigations**: Implement post-processing validation of LLM outputs, human review for critical content, guidance safety guardrails, and output filtering.

## Third-Party API Dependency Risks

- **Description**: Reliance on ChatGPT introduces dependencies on an external service with its own security considerations.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: Core functionality depends on the availability, security, and continued operation of OpenAI's services.

- **Example**: Service disruptions, API changes, or security incidents at OpenAI could affect the application.

- **Impact**: Service outages, unexpected behavior, or potential data leakage through the third-party provider.

- **Risk Severity**: Medium

- **Current Mitigations**: None specified in the architecture documents.

- **Missing Mitigations**: Develop redundancy plans, implement circuit breakers, establish clear data handling agreements with the provider, and monitor API usage patterns.
