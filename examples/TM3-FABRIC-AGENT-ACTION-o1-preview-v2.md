  - How are LLM outputs currently handled and are they verified before being used?
  - What monitoring is available to detect and respond to potential abuses or anomalies?
  - Can action permissions be further restricted without impacting necessary functionality?
  - Is there an incident response plan if API keys or secrets are compromised?

- **Assumptions**:
  - The action does not currently implement comprehensive input validation or output sanitization.
  - Secrets are securely stored as GitHub Secrets but may not be fully protected from exposure in logs.
  - Public repositories using this action allow comments from any GitHub user.
  - LLM prompt injection is a viable threat due to the nature of processing untrusted inputs.
  - Existing workflows may grant broader permissions than strictly necessary.
