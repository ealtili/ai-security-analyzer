### Recommended Security Controls
- **Authentication:**
  - Implement user authentication mechanisms to secure access to the API keys and settings.
- **Authorization:**
  - Implement role-based access control for different user roles.
- **Input Validation:**
  - Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent injection injection and Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Cryptography:**
