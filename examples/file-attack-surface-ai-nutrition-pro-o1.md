## ATTACK SURFACE ANALYSIS

### 1) External Malicious or Unauthorized Requests

- **Description**
  Meal Planner applications and other external clients send requests to AI Nutrition-Pro. Attackers could exploit stolen or weak API keys, or craft malicious requests to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro Contributes to the Attack Surface**
  AI Nutrition-Pro exposes endpoints through the API Gateway, granting external access for content generation and data storage. This external integration broadens the system's entry points.

- **Example**
  An attacker obtains the Meal Planner application’s API key and floods the backend API with high-volume requests or queries for unauthorized data.

- **Impact**
  Could lead to unauthorized data access, denial-of-service, or compromise of sensitive nutrition content and user information.

- **Risk Severity**
  **High**

- **Current Mitigations**
  - Authentication via API key
  - ACL rules at the API Gateway
  - TLS-encrypted network traffic
  - Rate limiting and input filtering

- **Missing Mitigations**
  - Use short-lived or more secure credential mechanisms
  - Strict server-side validation of request parameters
  - Restrict known untrusted IP sources or apply stricter access controls


### 2) Misconfiguration or Compromise of the API Gateway

- **Description**
  The API Gateway (Kong) is critical for authentication, rate limiting, and filtering. If misconfigured or compromised, an attacker could bypass safeguards and directly access the backend services or databases.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro Contributes to the Attack Surface**
  The entire architecture relies on the Gateway for secure entry, making it a high-value target.

- **Example**
  A misapplied ACL policy or vulnerability in the Kong API Gateway container allowing unrestricted access from the internet.

- **Impact**
  Full exposure of backend APIs, leading to unauthorized operations, data theft, and potential system takeover.

- **Risk Severity**
  **Critical**

- **Current Mitigations**
  - ACL rules in Kong
  - Rate limiting and some input filtering
  - TLS for transport encryption

- **Missing Mitigations**
  - Ensure only trusted administrators can configure or manage Kong
  - Restrict management endpoints and enforce robust configuration reviews
  - Segment the Gateway so it is not directly exposed to all external networks


### 3) Malicious Data Stored or Injection Within Databases

- **Description**
  The system stores dietitian content, requests, and LLM responses in its databases. Untrusted or improperly validated inputs could lead to malicious data being injected, stored, and later processed or displayed in unsafe ways.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro Contributes to the Attack Surface**
  AI Nutrition-Pro accepts content from multiple external Meal Planner applications and can store large volumes of user-supplied data, increasing the risk of ingestion of malicious payloads.

- **Example**
  An attacker includes hidden scripts or malicious payloads within dietitian sample content that later executes when viewed in the admin panel or triggers undesired processes in the backend.

- **Impact**
  Possible data corruption, unauthorized code execution, or unexpected behavior in the application.

- **Risk Severity**
  **Medium**

- **Current Mitigations**
  - Basic input filtering at the API Gateway
  - TLS to secure data in transit

- **Missing Mitigations**
  - Server-side content sanitization and stricter validation routines
  - Robust checks on user-supplied fields before storing in databases


### 4) Data Leakage or Malicious Prompt Injection via ChatGPT

- **Description**
  AI Nutrition-Pro forwards user-provided and dietitian-related data to ChatGPT for content generation. A malicious prompt or unclean data could trigger ChatGPT to disclose sensitive information or manipulate outputs in harmful ways.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro Contributes to the Attack Surface**
  By integrating with ChatGPT, AI Nutrition-Pro potentially sends private or sensitive user data to an external AI service, increasing the risk of unintentional exposure.

- **Example**
  A user crafts a prompt that coaxes ChatGPT to reveal data regarding other tenants' nutritional content or system details.

- **Impact**
  Leads to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data, privacy violations, or brand damage from negative or harmful AI-generated output.

- **Risk Severity**
  **High**

- **Current Mitigations**
  - Basic input filtering through API Gateway (though not specifically tailored to prompt injection)

- **Missing Mitigations**
  - Implement prompt moderation and filtering logic specific to AI requests
  - Redact or remove sensitive data from prompts before sending them to ChatGPT
  - Clearly define data-sharing boundaries with the external LLM service


### 5) Unauthorized Access or Privilege Escalation in the Web Control Plane

- **Description**
  The Web Control Plane manages client onboarding, configuration, and billing. If an attacker gains access—especially at an Administrator level—they could manipulate settings or access all stored data.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro Contributes to the Attack Surface**
  Centralized control over the entire application resides in a single interface. Any compromise here jeopardizes all downstream systems and data.

- **Example**
  An attacker leverages weak admin credentials to sign in and make destructive changes to the billing or client configuration.

- **Impact**
  Full compromise of application data, denial of service, or operational takeover.

- **Risk Severity**
  **Critical**

- **Current Mitigations**
  - TLS for secure transport to the control plane

- **Missing Mitigations**
  - Enforce multi-factor authentication and strong password controls for administrative roles
  - Implement granular role-based access to limit powerful actions
  - Separate duties so that no single account has unrestricted control of all features
