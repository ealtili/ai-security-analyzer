## Threat Enumeration

This section lists potential threats using a STRIDE-based approach:

1. Spoofing (S)
   - Threat: Attacker spoofs Meal Planner Application or obtains legitimate API keys to imitate authorized requests.
     - Attack Vector: Steal or guess API keys; exploit misconfigured API Gateway authentication.
     - Affected Components: API Gateway, API Application.

2. Tampering (T)
   - Threat: Malicious actor alters requests or responses between Meal Planner Application and AI Nutrition-Pro or tampers with data in transit to the databases.
     - Attack Vector: MITM attacks or replay attacks if TLS is improperly configured or vulnerable.
     - Affected Components: API Gateway, API Application, Control Plane Database, API Database.

3. Repudiation (R)
   - Threat: Lack of proper logging or auditing allows attackers or malicious insiders to deny having performed specific actions or transactions.
     - Attack Vector: Incomplete or insufficient logging on the API Gateway, Web Control Plane, or backend services.
     - Affected Components: Web Control Plane, API Application, Databases.

4. Information Disclosure (I)
   - Threat: Sensitive data (e.g., dietitians’ content, billing data, or personal information) is leaked.
     - Attack Vector: Misconfigured database access controls, insecure endpoints, insufficient encryption in storage or transit.
     - Affected Components: Control Plane Database, API Database, Web Control Plane.

5. Denial of Service (D)
   - Threat: High-volume requests overwhelm the API Gateway or the backend, preventing legitimate requests from being fulfilled.
     - Attack Vector: Flooding with large requests or malicious traffic, exploiting insufficient rate limiting configuration.
     - Affected Components: API Gateway, API Application.

6. Elevation of Privilege (E)
   - Threat: An attacker, initially with limited access, escalates privileges to gain administrator or root-level access in the system.
     - Attack Vector: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Web Control Plane, misconfigured IAM roles, or lacking access controls.
     - Affected Components: Web Control Plane, API Gateway, Databases (if admin privileges can be obtained).

## Impact Assessment

Assessing the potential damage, likelihood, and overall severity of each threat:

1. Spoofing API Keys
   - Impact: High (Compromised or cloned keys could expose the entire application functionality).
   - Likelihood: Medium (API keys can be stolen or guessed if not handled properly).
   - Existing Controls: API Gateway authentication; rate limiting.

2. Tampering of Data in Transit
   - Impact: Medium (Could lead to corrupted or malicious data reaching the system).
   - Likelihood: Low to Medium (Requires bypass or break of TLS, but possible if misconfigured).
   - Existing Controls: TLS encryption between components.

3. Repudiation (Insufficient Logging)
   - Impact: Medium (Harder to investigate and demonstrate malicious actions; compliance issues).
   - Likelihood: Medium (Commonly overlooked area if logging is not enforced).
   - Existing Controls: Potential basic cloud logs; depends on specific logging configurations.

4. Information Disclosure
   - Impact: High (Sensitive dietary and billing data could be leaked, resulting in reputational, legal, and financial consequences).
   - Likelihood: Medium (Depends on database security, data access policies, and encryption at rest).
   - Existing Controls: TLS in transit; role-based access or ACLs (assumed).

5. Denial of Service (DoS)
   - Impact: High (Service disruptions can affect all Meal Planner applications and reputation).
   - Likelihood: Medium (APIs can be targeted with DoS or DDoS attacks).
   - Existing Controls: Rate limiting in API Gateway, AWS auto-scaling (partially).

6. Elevation of Privilege
   - Impact: Critical (Full administrative access could compromise the entire system: data, billing, etc.).
   - Likelihood: Low to Medium (Requires specific vulnerabilities, but consequences are severe).
   - Existing Controls: IAM roles, strong administrative controls (assumed).

## Threat Ranking

Based on impact and likelihood:

1. Elevation of Privilege (Critical)
2. Information Disclosure (High)
3. Denial of Service (High)
4. Spoofing API Keys (High)
5. Tampering (Medium)
6. Repudiation (Medium)

Justification:
- Elevation of Privilege poses a system-wide compromise, increasing its criticality.
- Information Disclosure and DoS carry high business and reputational risks.
- Spoofing API keys could also lead to broad access but may require additional steps to exploit.
- Tampering and Repudiation are moderate risks with potentially simpler existing mitigations.

## Mitigation Recommendations

1. Elevation of Privilege (Critical)

   - Related Threat(s): Information Disclosure.

3. Denial of Service (High)
   - Recommendation:
     - Improve or regularly test API Gateway rate limiting and ban lists.
     - Consider DDoS protection services (e.g., AWS Shield).
     - Implement circuit breakers or auto-scaling on critical components.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

1. Questions
   - What logging frameworks are currently in use for both the Web Control Plane and the API Gateway?
   - Are API keys stored and rotated via a secure secrets management system?
   - Is ChatGPT-3.5 usage covered under strict data-handling policies to prevent sensitive data leakage?

2. Assumptions
   - TLS is properly configured and enforced across all AWS ECS components and RDS databases.
   - Access to production systems is restricted to authorized administrators via secure IAM roles.
   - Container images are regularly patched, and AWS responsibilities (e.g., underlying OS security) are managed following best practices.
