## APPLICATION THREATS

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | STRIDE CATEGORY | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 0001 | Flask Core | Lack of CSRF Protection | Spoofing | Without built-in CSRF protection, applications are vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks. | Not mitigated by default; relies on developers to implement. | Implement default CSRF protection within the core framework. | High likelihood due to commonality of CSRF attacks. | High impact as it can lead to unauthorized actions on behalf of users. | High |
| 0002 | Sessions | Session Hijacking | Tampering | Session data is sensitive and can be targeted for hijacking. | SecureCookieSessionInterface and cryptographic signing are used. | Enforce secure defaults for session cookies (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite` attributes). | Medium likelihood due to existing mitigations. | High impact as it can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts. | High |
| 0003 | JSON Handling | JSON Injection | Tampering | JSON data is commonly used and can be a vector for injection attacks. | Custom JSON providers with protection against attacks. | Incorporate input validation utilities to prevent JSON-based attacks. | Medium likelihood due to existing mitigations. | Medium impact as it can lead to data corruption or unauthorized actions. | Medium |
| 0004 | Helper Functions | Directory Traversal | Information Disclosure | File serving utilities can be exploited for directory traversal attacks. | Safe file serving utilities are implemented. | Regularly review and update file serving utilities to address new vulnerabilities. | Low likelihood due to existing mitigations. | Medium impact as it can lead to unauthorized file access. | Low |

# DEPLOYMENT THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS

- **Host Server:** The physical or virtual server hosting the Flask application.
- **Nginx (Reverse Proxy):** Handles incoming HTTPS requests and provides SSL/TLS termination.
- **Gunicorn (WSGI Server):** Runs the Flask application and manages request handling.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES

- **Host Server to Nginx:** Trust boundary between the host server and the reverse proxy server.
- **Nginx to Gunicorn:** Trust boundary between the reverse proxy server and the WSGI server.
- **Gunicorn to Flask Application:** Trust boundary between the WSGI server and the Flask application.

## DEPLOYMENT THREATS

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 0001 | Nginx | SSL/TLS Misconfiguration | Misconfigured SSL/TLS can lead to insecure communication. | SSL/TLS is configured for secure communication. | Regularly update SSL/TLS configurations and use strong ciphers. | Medium likelihood due to potential misconfigurations. | High impact as it can lead to data interception. | High |
| 0002 | Gunicorn | Denial of Service (DoS) | High traffic can overwhelm the WSGI server, leading to service disruption. | Not specifically mitigated; relies on server capacity and configuration. | Implement rate limiting and request throttling. | Medium likelihood due to potential high traffic. | High impact as it can lead to service unavailability. | High |

# BUILD THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS

- **Source Code Repository:** Contains the framework and application code.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automates testing, building, and publishing processes.
- **Build Artifacts:** Generated files ready for deployment or distribution.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES

- **Developer to Source Code Repository:** Trust boundary between the developer's local environment and the code repository.
- **Source Code Repository to CI/CD Pipeline:** Trust boundary between the code repository and the CI/CD pipeline.
- **CI/CD Pipeline to Build Artifacts:** Trust boundary between the CI/CD pipeline and the generated build artifacts.

## BUILD THREATS

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 0001 | Source Code Repository | Code Tampering | Unauthorized access to the repository can lead to code tampering. | Not specifically mitigated; relies on repository access controls. | Implement strict access controls and audit logs. | Medium likelihood due to potential insider threats. | High impact as it can lead to compromised code integrity. | High |
| 0002 | CI/CD Pipeline | Supply Chain Attack | Compromised dependencies or build tools can introduce vulnerabilities. | Security scanners and linters are used during the build process. | Regularly update dependencies and use trusted sources. | Medium likelihood due to reliance on third-party tools. | High impact as it can lead to widespread vulnerabilities. | High |

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

**Questions:**

1. Have the new session management features been thoroughly tested for security vulnerabilities?
2. Are there plans to implement default CSRF protection within the core framework?
3. How does the new JSON handling mechanism protect against known JSON attacks?
4. Are the helper functions in `helpers.py` safe against path traversal and other file-serving vulnerabilities?
5. Has the documentation been updated to guide developers on secure usage of context locals and global proxies?

**Assumptions:**

- It is assumed that the integration of context locals and global proxies is handled securely to prevent data leakage between requests.
- It is assumed that the helper functions for sending files have protections against directory traversal attacks.
- It is assumed that developers are responsible for implementing additional security measures like CSRF protection until the framework provides it by default.
- It is assumed that the JSON handling modules are designed to safely serialize and deserialize data without introducing security risks.
- It is assumed that the logging mechanisms are configured to avoid exposing sensitive information in production environments.
