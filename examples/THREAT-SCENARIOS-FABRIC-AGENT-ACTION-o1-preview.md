# THREAT SCENARIOS

- Unauthorized users trigger action via PRs/issues, causing unwanted API calls and costs.
- API keys leak due to misconfiguration, allowing unauthorized access and misuse.
- Malicious code injection through PRs leads to code execution in the action.
- Exposed logs or outputs reveal sensitive data, leading to information leakage.
- Denial of Service by excessive triggering of the action, consuming resources.
- The action executes unintended commands due to unvalidated inputs.

# THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS

- Considering likely misuse of action triggering via PRs/issues.
- Evaluated risks of API key leakage from misconfiguration.
- Analyzed code injection risks through user-supplied inputs.
- Assessed possibility of sensitive data exposure in logs/outputs.
- Determined impact of resource exhaustion from action overuse.

# RECOMMENDED CONTROLS

- Restrict action execution to authorized users using conditional checks.
- Securely store API keys in secrets, avoid exposure in logs or outputs.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent code injection.
- Limit action triggers to prevent excessive usage and resource consumption.
- Implement logging best practices to prevent sensitive data leakage.

# NARRATIVE ANALYSIS

The most likely threats to the Fabric Agent Action involve unauthorized users triggering the action via pull requests or issue comments, which could lead to unnecessary API calls and increased costs. This is a realistic concern because public repositories can be accessed by anyone, and without proper access controls, the action might be exploited.

Another significant risk is the leakage of API keys due to misconfiguration or improper handling of secrets. Exposing API keys could allow unauthorized access to LLM services, resulting in misuse and additional costs.

While code injection through malicious PRs is a potential threat, it is less likely if appropriate input validation and sanitization are implemented. Ensuring that all user inputs are properly validated reduces the risk of unintended code execution within the action.

Additionally, while a Denial of Service attack via excessive triggering of the action is possible, it is less likely to be a significant threat. Implementing basic rate limiting or monitoring can help mitigate this without overcomplicating the system.

By focusing on the most probable threats and implementing the recommended controls, the real-world risks can be effectively mitigated without overcomplicating defenses against unlikely scenarios.

# CONCLUSION

By implementing access controls and secure configurations, the Fabric Agent Action can be protected against its most realistic threats.
