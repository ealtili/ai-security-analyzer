# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - The primary goal of the screenshot-to-code project is to provide a tool that simplifies and accelerates the process of converting visual designs (screenshots, mockups, Figma designs) into functional code.
  - Key business priorities include:
    - Accuracy and quality of the generated code.
    - Support for a wide range of frontend stacks (HTML, React, Vue, etc.).
    - Integration with leading AI models (Claude, GPT).
    - Offering both open-source and hosted (paid) versions to cater to different user needs and generate revenue.
    - Providing enterprise solutions for larger organizations.
- Business Risks:
  - Reliance on the accuracy and availability of third-party AI models. Inaccuracies in code generation can lead to user dissatisfaction and rework.
  - Security risks associated with handling user-provided API keys and potentially sensitive screenshot data.
  - Competition from other AI-powered code generation tools.
  - Maintaining the open-source project and supporting the community while also developing and monetizing the hosted version.
  - Scalability and reliability of the hosted version to handle enterprise demands.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: API Key Management: The application requires users to provide their own OpenAI or Anthropic API keys to access the AI models. This is documented in `README.md` and `Troubleshooting.md`. API keys are stored locally in the browser's local storage, as mentioned in `Troubleshooting.md`.
  - security control: Dockerization: Both frontend and backend are dockerized, as evidenced by `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`. This provides a consistent and isolated deployment environment.
  - security control: Input Validation (Implicit): The application processes images and text prompts, implying some level of input handling, although explicit validation mechanisms are not detailed in the provided files.
  - security control: CORS Configuration: CORS is configured in `backend/main.py` to allow requests from any origin (`allow_origins=["*"]`), which is suitable for an open application but might need to be restricted for production enterprise environments.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on User-Provided API Keys: The application relies on users to manage and secure their own API keys. This shifts the responsibility of API key security to the end-user.
  - accepted risk: Open CORS Policy: The permissive CORS policy (`allow_origins=["*"]`) might expose the backend API to potential cross-site scripting attacks if not carefully managed.
  - accepted risk: Limited Input Validation Transparency: The extent and rigor of input validation are not explicitly defined, which could lead to vulnerabilities if not implemented comprehensively.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement robust input validation on both frontend and backend to sanitize screenshots and user inputs to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. This is especially important for new routes like `/api/screenshot` which takes URL as input and `/generate-code` which handles video data.
  - security control: For the hosted version, consider implementing secure API key management, potentially using a secrets management system to avoid storing keys directly in the browser or backend code.
  - security control: Implement rate limiting and API usage monitoring to protect against abuse and potential denial-of-service attacks, especially for the hosted version and for routes like `/api/screenshot` that use external services.
  - security control: Conduct regular security vulnerability scanning and penetration testing for both frontend and backend components to identify and remediate potential weaknesses.
  - security control: Implement logging and monitoring of application activity, especially API requests and error events, to detect and respond to security incidents. Monitor usage of external services like screenshotone.com.
  - security control: For enterprise deployments, consider restricting the CORS policy to only allow requests from authorized domains.
  - security control: Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) in the frontend to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - For the open-source version, authentication is not explicitly required as it's designed for local use with user-provided API keys.
    - For the hosted and enterprise versions, implement user authentication to manage access and potentially offer user-specific features and usage tracking.
  - Authorization:
    - For the hosted and enterprise versions, implement authorization controls to manage access to different features and data based on user roles or subscriptions. Consider authorization for evaluation routes (`/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, `/best-of-n-evals`) to restrict access to sensitive evaluation data.
  - Input Validation:
    - Implement strict input validation for all user inputs, including:
      - Screenshot uploads: Validate file types, sizes, and potentially scan for malicious content.
      - API keys: Basic format validation.
      - User settings and configurations.
      - URLs for screenshot capture: Validate URL format and potentially sanitize to prevent Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities in `/api/screenshot` route.
      - Video uploads: Validate file types, sizes, and consider security implications of processing video data in `/generate-code` route.
    - Backend API should validate all incoming requests to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
  - Cryptography:
    - API keys are currently stored in browser's local storage. While browsers offer some level of encryption for local storage, consider more robust client-side encryption for sensitive data if necessary, or move key management to a more secure backend service for hosted versions.
    - Ensure secure communication (HTTPS) is enforced for all network traffic, especially for the hosted version, to protect data in transit.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - The core critical business process is the AI-powered code generation service itself. Any disruption or compromise to this process directly impacts the value proposition of the application.
  - User data processing, including handling screenshots, video, and API keys, is also a critical process that needs to be protected to maintain user trust and comply with potential privacy regulations.
  - Website screenshot capture service is also a critical business process, especially for enterprise users who might need to capture screenshots of internal applications.
  - Code evaluation functionality is important for improving the quality of code generation and for users to compare different outputs.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - API Keys: These are highly sensitive as they grant access to powerful AI models and the ScreenshotOne API. Compromise of API keys could lead to unauthorized usage, billing fraud, or data breaches if the AI models or screenshot service are misused.
  - Screenshots and Video Data: User-uploaded screenshots and videos can contain sensitive information depending on the context of the UI being converted. The sensitivity level is medium to high, depending on the user and the content.
  - Generated Code: While the generated code itself is less sensitive, it is the output of the service and its integrity is important for the functionality of the tool. Low sensitivity.
  - User Settings: User preferences and configurations are less sensitive but contribute to user experience and customization. Low sensitivity.
  - Evaluation Data: Data generated during code evaluations, including input images and generated code outputs, might contain sensitive information depending on the context. Medium sensitivity.
