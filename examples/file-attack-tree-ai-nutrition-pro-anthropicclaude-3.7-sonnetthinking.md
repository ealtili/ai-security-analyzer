## 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

### High-Risk Paths

1. **LLM Prompt Injection (2.1.3)**
   - **Justification**: This attack has high likelihood with relatively low effort and medium skill requirements. It exploits the core AI functionality by crafting specially designed prompts that can manipulate ChatGPT's responses. The high detection difficulty makes this particularly concerning, as malicious prompts may appear legitimate.

2. **Information Extraction via Prompts (5.1.2)**
   - **Justification**: Similar to prompt injection but specifically focused on extracting sensitive information. With high likelihood, high impact, and high detection difficulty, attackers could potentially extract confidential information from the system through carefully crafted prompts.

3. **Input Validation Bypass (1.3.1)**
   - **Justification**: The API Gateway is the first line of defense. If its input validation can be bypassed (which has high likelihood), attackers gain a foothold for other attack vectors. This could allow malicious inputs to reach the backend systems.

4. **Admin Credential Theft (3.1.1)**
   - **Justification**: While only medium likelihood, the critical impact makes this a high-risk path. Administrative access would provide complete control over the system, allowing an attacker to modify configurations, access all tenant data, and potentially extract API keys.

5. **Harmful Content Generation (5.1.1)**
   - **Justification**: This attack has high likelihood, low effort requirements, and low skill barriers, making it accessible to many attackers. The potential for generating harmful or misleading diet advice could cause significant reputational damage and potentially health risks to end users.

### Critical Nodes

1. **API Gateway Security (Node 1)**
   - This is a critical defensive point as it controls all access to the system.
   - Breaching this node opens multiple attack paths into the system.

2. **LLM Integration Security (Node 5)**
   - The core functionality revolves around LLM usage, making this a critical security focus.
   - Vulnerabilities here directly impact the quality and safety of generated content.

3. **Admin Authentication (Node 3.1)**
   - Administrative access provides complete control over the system.
   - Compromising this node enables virtually all other attacks.

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies

### For LLM-Related Vulnerabilities (2.1.3, 5.1.1, 5.1.2)
- Implement robust prompt sanitization and validation before sending to ChatGPT
- Create a content filtering layer to evaluate generated content before delivery
- Apply strict prompt templates with input sanitization
- Establish boundaries in prompts to prevent prompt injection
- Monitor and log unusual prompt patterns
- Implement content moderation for all generated outputs

### For API Gateway Security (1.1-1.4)
- Implement strong API key management with regular rotation
- Apply defense-in-depth with multiple validation layers
- Use positive security model (whitelist) for input validation
- Implement context-aware filtering
- Configure proper ACLs with principle of least privilege
- Implement sophisticated rate limiting with client fingerprinting

### For Administrative Access Protection (3.1)
- Require multi-factor authentication for all administrative access
- Implement IP allowlisting for administrative interfaces
- Use strong password policies with regular rotation
- Set short session timeouts for administrative sessions
- Log and alert on unusual administrative activities
- Segment administrative privileges following least-privilege principles

### For Database Security (4.1, 4.2)
- Follow AWS RDS security best practices
- Implement strong encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Restrict database access using least privilege principles
- Regularly audit database access patterns
- Secure database backups with proper access controls

### For Training Data Security (5.2)
- Validate all content samples before using them for LLM training
- Implement approval workflows for new content samples
- Monitor for anomalous content patterns
- Apply content filtering to detect potentially malicious samples

## 9. Summarize Findings

### Key Risks Identified

1. **LLM Vulnerabilities**: The AI Nutrition-Pro application is particularly vulnerable to LLM-specific attacks including prompt injection, information extraction via prompts, and harmful content generation, which could lead to data exposure or reputational damage.

2. **API Gateway Security**: As the entry point to the system, any weaknesses in authentication, authorization, or input validation could expose the entire application to attacks.

3. **Administrative Access**: The Web Control Plane represents a high-value target that, if compromised, would give attackers complete control over the system.

4. **Data Exposure**: Both databases contain sensitive information (dietitian content, client information, API keys) that could be targeted through various attack vectors.

5. **AI Content Manipulation**: The ability to influence or manipulate AI-generated content could lead to harmful or misleading nutritional advice being delivered to end users.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Enhance LLM Security**:
   - Implement comprehensive prompt validation and sanitization
   - Create guardrails for LLM interactions
   - Establish content moderation for outputs
   - Monitor for suspicious prompt patterns

2. **Strengthen Access Controls**:
   - Implement robust API key management
   - Add multi-factor authentication for administrative access
   - Apply least privilege principles throughout the system
   - Regularly rotate credentials and audit access

3. **Improve Input Validation**:
   - Implement defense-in-depth validation at multiple layers
   - Use positive security models (whitelisting)
   - Validate all inputs before they reach backend services or the LLM

4. **Protect Sensitive Data**:
   - Encrypt all sensitive data
   - Minimize unnecessary data storage
   - Implement proper database access controls
   - Secure database backups

5. **Secure External Integrations**:
   - Validate all data crossing system boundaries
   - Apply mutual TLS for service-to-service communication
   - Monitor integration points for abnormal behavior

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

### Questions:
1. What authentication mechanisms are used for administrator access to the Web Control Plane?
2. How are OpenAI API credentials managed and secured within the application?
3. What validation is performed on dietitian content samples before they're used for LLM prompts?
4. Are there monitoring systems in place to detect unusual prompt patterns or generated content?
5. What security measures exist for the AWS ECS containers beyond standard configurations?

### Assumptions:
1. The API keys used by Meal Planner applications are securely managed and not easily accessible.
2. The system follows AWS security best practices for ECS and RDS deployments.
3. The API Gateway implements some level of input validation and request filtering.
4. Administrative access requires strong authentication credentials.
5. Network traffic between internal components is secured with TLS, even if not explicitly mentioned.
