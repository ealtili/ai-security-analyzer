## 7. High-Risk Paths Analysis

### Most Significant Risks

1. **Prompt Injection Attacks (3.1)**
   - Likelihood: High
   - Impact: Medium
   - Justification: LLM applications are particularly vulnerable to prompt injection, where malicious inputs can manipulate AI model responses. This could lead to generating harmful nutritional advice or manipulating system behavior through carefully crafted inputs.

2. **API Key Theft from Meal Planner Applications (1.1.1)**
   - Likelihood: Medium
   - Impact: High
   - Justification: If Meal Planner applications don't securely store API keys, attackers could steal them and impersonate legitimate clients, potentially accessing sensitive data or performing unauthorized actions.

3. **Compromising Connected Meal Planner Applications (6.1.1)**
   - Likelihood: Medium
   - Impact: High
   - Justification: External applications are potential entry points that may have weaker security than AI Nutrition-Pro itself. Compromising these applications provides a trusted channel into the system.

4. **SQL Injection Attacks (2.1)**
   - Likelihood: Medium
   - Impact: High
   - Justification: Both databases could be vulnerable to SQL injection if input sanitization is inadequate, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.

### Critical Nodes

1. **API Gateway Security (1.1.3, 1.2.1, 5.1.1)**
   - The API Gateway is the primary entry point for all external communications and a critical security boundary.

2. **Content Validation and Sanitization (3.1.1, 3.3.1)**
   - Proper validation of all inputs, especially those forwarded to ChatGPT, is essential to prevent prompt injection and data poisoning.

3. **Authentication Mechanisms (1.1, 1.2)**
   - The security of API keys and authentication workflows is fundamental to system security.

4. **Third-Party Integration Security (6.1, 6.2)**
   - The security posture of integrated systems directly impacts AI Nutrition-Pro's security.

## 8. Mitigation Strategies

### For Prompt Injection Attacks:
1. Implement robust input sanitization for all data sent to ChatGPT
2. Create a library of safe prompt templates that resist injection
3. Apply content filtering on generated outputs
4. Implement human review for a sample of generated content
5. Use rate limiting and anomaly detection on content generation requests

### For API Key Protection:
1. Implement short-lived API keys with automatic rotation
2. Provide secure storage guidelines to Meal Planner application developers
3. Use IP-based restrictions for API key usage
4. Monitor for unusual patterns in API key usage
5. Limit the scope of each API key to necessary functions only

### For Third-Party Integration Security:
1. Require security assessments of Meal Planner applications before integration
2. Implement strict input validation at integration boundaries
3. Use mutual TLS for application-to-application communication
4. Monitor communication patterns for anomalies
5. Create isolated environments for each integrated application

### For Database Security:
1. Use parameterized queries for all database interactions
2. Implement least privilege database access
3. Encrypt sensitive data at rest in databases
4. Regularly audit database access and queries
5. Deploy database activity monitoring

### For API Gateway Security:
1. Keep the API Gateway updated with security patches
2. Configure appropriate rate limiting and throttling
3. Implement robust request validation
4. Deploy a Web Application Firewall in front of the API Gateway
5. Set up monitoring and alerting for suspicious traffic patterns

## 9. Summary of Findings

### Key Risks Identified

1. **LLM Vulnerabilities**: The system's reliance on ChatGPT makes it vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that could manipulate generated nutritional content.

2. **Integration Security Risks**: The connections with external Meal Planner applications and the ChatGPT API create potential attack surfaces.

3. **API Key Management**: The security of API keys is critical, as compromised keys would allow unauthorized access to the system.

4. **Data Protection Challenges**: Both databases contain valuable information that could be targeted through SQL injection or authentication bypass attacks.

5. **Availability Concerns**: The system could be disrupted through targeted DoS attacks against the API Gateway or by depleting resources through inefficient queries.

### Recommended Actions

1. Implement comprehensive input validation and prompt engineering practices to mitigate LLM-specific vulnerabilities.

2. Establish secure API key management processes including rotation, scope limitations, and usage monitoring.

3. Create a security assessment framework for third-party applications before allowing integration.

4. Strengthen database security through parameterized queries, encryption, and access controls.

5. Configure robust rate limiting and resource allocation to prevent DoS attacks.

6. Develop security guidelines for both internal developers and external partners.

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

### Questions:
1. What authentication mechanism is used for Administrator access to the Control Plane?
2. How are API keys provisioned, rotated, and revoked?
3. What input validation is performed before sending prompts to ChatGPT?
4. Is the nutritional content reviewed before being returned to clients?
5. How are security updates managed across the containerized services?

### Assumptions:
1. API keys are the primary authentication mechanism for Meal Planner applications.
2. All application components run in AWS ECS with standard container security.
3. The system stores nutritional content that could be sensitive but not highly regulated.
4. ChatGPT-3.5 is accessed via the standard OpenAI API.
5. All network communications use TLS encryption.
