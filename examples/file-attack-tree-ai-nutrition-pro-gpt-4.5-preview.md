# Threat Modeling Analysis for AI Nutrition-Pro Application Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

### Overview

AI Nutrition-Pro is an API-driven backend solution that provides nutrition and diet-related content generation powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 Large Language Model (LLM). It integrates with Meal Planner applications which send dietitians' content samples and receive AI-generated results (diet introductions, meal plans, etc.). The platform includes a control plane for onboarding clients, managing configurations, and tracking billing information. Deployment and infrastructure are hosted within AWS services like Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon RDS databases.

### Key Components and Features

- **API Gateway (Kong):** Authentication, input filtering, rate limiting.
- **Web Control Plane:** Golang-based web control panel hosted in AWS ECS for admin and client management.
- **Control Plane Database:** Amazon RDS database storing administrative and billing information.
- **API Application:** Golang app hosted on AWS ECS that interacts with Meal Planner apps and ChatGPT.
- **API Database:** Amazon RDS database storing highly sensitive dietary content provided by dietitians, along with requests and responses to ChatGPT.

### Dependencies

- Golang services (Control Plane, API Application)
- Kong API Gateway
- AWS ECS, Amazon RDS, AWS infrastructure
- External API dependency (OpenAI ChatGPT-3.5)

## 2. Define the Root Goal of the Attack Tree

**Attacker's Ultimate Objective:**
**Compromise AI Nutrition-Pro application directly, to either expose sensitive dietary and billing data or compromise clients that trust data coming from AI Nutrition-Pro.**

---

## 3. Identify High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)

Potential realistic avenues attackers might pursue:

1. **Compromise API Gateway Security Mechanisms**
2. **Compromise Web Control Plane**
3. **Exploit API Application Vulnerabilities**
4. **Poison or Manipulate Data exchanged between API Application and ChatGPT**

## 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

### High-Risk Paths
- Theft/leak of API keys due to realistic insider/social engineering routes.
- Injection/Malicious manipulation in LLM prompts (emerging attack vectors in OpenAI-integrated solutions).
- Exploitation of Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities in Web Control Plane.

### Critical Nodes
- API Gateway authentication and ACL configuration
- Web Control Plane authentication/authorization
- Input validation at API Application layer

Justification: Compromising these points can directly lead to severe data breaches, reputation loss, and cascading trust issues with customer-facing functionalities.

---

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies
- API Key Protection: Secure storage strategies in Meal Planner apps, frequent key rotations, tighter access control.
- Strengthening Input Validation on API Gateway, API Application & Web Control Plane APIs.
- Rigorous Prompt Sanitizations and validation patterns for LLM API integration.
- Hardened Authentication/Authorization: MFA, strict role definitions, secure coding and review.

---

## 9. Summarize Findings

### Key Risks Identified
- API Key compromise/leaks
- Weak authentication and authorization mechanisms in Web Control Plane
- Input validation weaknesses used by attacker for injections and manipulations of prompts/data exchange

### Recommended Actions
- Audit and improve API key handling practices of integrated Meal Planner clients.
- Extensive secure coding and input validation improvements in Golang-based components.
- Thorough examination and secure implementation of OpenAI platform integration.

---

## 10. Questions & Assumptions
- Assumed secure operation and hosting infrastructure within AWS
- Are there controls on Meal Planner's API key usage/storage?
- Are there vulnerability/security reviews on the Web Control Plane and API codebase performed regularly?
- Assumed that ChatGPT service is trusted and reliable but recognized as needing hardened integration decorators.
