**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities -> Bypass Access Controls via Routing -> Lack of Proper Authentication/Authorization Checks (CRITICAL NODE)**

* **Lack of Proper Authentication/Authorization Checks (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Description:** Routes intended for authenticated users might lack proper `@login_required` decorators or custom authorization logic, allowing unauthorized access.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High (Full Access to Sensitive Data/Actions)
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Low
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires Code Review)

**2. HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious Data via Request Parameters -> Lack of Input Sanitization (CRITICAL NODE)**

* **Lack of Input Sanitization (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Description:** Failing to sanitize user input from request parameters (GET, POST, etc.) can lead to various injection attacks like SQL injection (if interacting with a database), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if rendering in templates without escaping), or command injection if executing system commands.
    * **Likelihood:** High
    * **Impact:** High (XSS, SQL Injection, Command Injection)
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires Monitoring Input and Output)

**3. HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Template Engine Vulnerabilities -> Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) -> Unsanitized User Input Rendered in Templates (CRITICAL NODE)**

* **Unsanitized User Input Rendered in Templates (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Description:** If user-provided data is directly embedded into Jinja2 templates without proper escaping, attackers can inject malicious code that will be executed on the server.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical (Remote Code Execution)
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Medium to High
    * **Detection Difficulty:** High (Difficult to Detect Without Specific Payloads)

**4. HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Flask Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Information Disclosure via Debug Mode -> Debug Mode Enabled in Production (CRITICAL NODE)**

* **Debug Mode Enabled in Production (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Description:** Leaving Flask's debug mode enabled in a production environment exposes sensitive information like the application's source code, environment variables, and an interactive debugger, which can be exploited by attackers.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Common Mistake)
    * **Impact:** High (Source Code Exposure, Sensitive Data)
    * **Effort:** Very Low
    * **Skill Level:** Very Low
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Very Low (Checking Configuration)

**5. HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Flask Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Secret Key Exposure -> Secret Key Hardcoded in Source Code (CRITICAL NODE)**

* **Secret Key Hardcoded in Source Code (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Description:** Hardcoding the Flask secret key directly in the source code makes it easily accessible to attackers.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical (Session Hijacking, Data Tampering)
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Low
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Code Review)

**6. HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Flask Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Secret Key Exposure -> Secret Key Stored Insecurely (CRITICAL NODE)**

* **Secret Key Stored Insecurely (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Description:** Storing the secret key in easily accessible configuration files or environment variables without proper protection can lead to its compromise.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical (Session Hijacking, Data Tampering)
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires Access to Configuration)

**7. HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Flask Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Misconfigured Security Headers**

* **Missing or Incorrect `Strict-Transport-Security` Header:**
    * **Description:** Failing to set the `Strict-Transport-Security` header allows for man-in-the-middle attacks by not enforcing HTTPS connections.
    * **Likelihood:** High
    * **Impact:** Medium (Man-in-the-Middle Attacks)
    * **Effort:** Very Low
    * **Skill Level:** Very Low
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Very Low (Using Browser Developer Tools)
* **Missing or Incorrect `Content-Security-Policy` Header:**
    * **Description:** Failing to set the `Content-Security-Policy` header increases the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by not restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources.
    * **Likelihood:** High
    * **Impact:** High (Cross-Site Scripting)
    * **Effort:** Very Low
    * **Skill Level:** Very Low
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Very Low (Using Browser Developer Tools)
