### Attack Tree: Compromise screenshot-to-code Application

**Attacker Goal:** Compromise screenshot-to-code application to gain unauthorized access or cause disruption.

1.  **Compromise screenshot-to-code Application**
    - Description: The attacker aims to undermine the security and functionality of the screenshot-to-code application.
    - Actionable insights: Implement robust security measures across all application layers (frontend, backend, infrastructure) and educate users about secure API key management. Regularly audit code and dependencies for vulnerabilities.

    2.  **Exploit API Key Vulnerabilities**
        - Description: Attacker targets the API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate, ScreenshotOne) used by the application to access and misuse AI and screenshot services.
        - Actionable insights:  Emphasize secure API key management in documentation. For hosted version, consider server-side key management and access control. For open-source, clearly document user responsibility for key security.
        - Likelihood: Medium (depending on user security practices and potential leaks)
        - Impact: High (unauthorized use of AI/screenshot services, potential cost implications for users, data access depending on AI model capabilities)
        - Effort: Low (if keys are easily accessible) to Medium (if keys are somewhat protected but leaked)
        - Skill Level: Low to Medium
        - Detection Difficulty: Medium (unauthorized API usage might be detectable through monitoring API usage patterns, but attribution can be difficult)

        - 3.  **Retrieve API Keys from Client-Side Storage**
            - Description: Attacker attempts to extract API keys stored in the browser's local storage or session storage, where the application mentions keys are stored.
            - Actionable insights: While client-side storage is used, warn users about the risks of storing sensitive keys in browsers and recommend best practices like using environment variables when self-hosting. Consider encrypting keys in local storage if feasible, though browser-side encryption has limitations.
            - Likelihood: Medium (if attacker gains access to user's browser or machine)
            - Impact: High (direct access to user's API keys)
            - Effort: Low (using browser developer tools or scripts)
            - Skill Level: Low
            - Detection Difficulty: Low (client-side attacks are hard to detect from the server side)

        - 3.  **Retrieve API Keys from Environment Variables (Self-hosted instances)**
            - Description: For self-hosted instances, if users misconfigure or expose their environment (e.g., through insecure Docker setups or exposed .env files), attackers might retrieve API keys.
            - Actionable insights:  Provide clear instructions and warnings against exposing environment variables. Emphasize secure Docker configurations and best practices for managing .env files.
            - Likelihood: Medium (depends on user's server security practices)

            - Effort: Medium (requires identifying vulnerable versions and exploiting them)
            - Skill Level: Medium
            - Detection Difficulty: Medium (vulnerability scanners can detect known vulnerabilities, intrusion detection systems might detect exploitation attempts)

        - 3.  **Code Injection Vulnerabilities**
            - Description: If backend code improperly handles user inputs (though less direct user input in this app, but consider processing of image/video data or indirectly through settings), it could be vulnerable to injection attacks.
            - Actionable insights: Thoroughly review code for potential injection points. Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all external data. Use parameterized queries if database interactions are added in future.
            - Likelihood: Low to Medium (depending on code complexity and input handling)
            - Impact: High (potential for arbitrary code execution on the server)
            - Effort: Medium to High (requires finding injection points and crafting exploits)
            - Skill Level: Medium to High
            - Detection Difficulty: Medium to High (code reviews and static analysis can help, but runtime detection might be challenging)

        - 3.  **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on Backend API**
            - Description: Attacker floods the backend API endpoints, especially resource-intensive endpoints like `/generate_code`, causing service disruption.
            - Actionable insights: Implement rate limiting and request throttling on API endpoints. Use load balancing and autoscaling to handle traffic spikes. Consider using a CDN to protect against volumetric attacks. Implement limits on video file sizes for upload.
            - Likelihood: Medium (publicly accessible API)
            - Impact: Medium to High (service unavailability)
            - Effort: Low to Medium (using readily available DoS tools)
            - Skill Level: Low to Medium
            - Detection Difficulty: Medium (DoS attacks are generally detectable through network monitoring and anomaly detection)

        - 3.  **Path Traversal in Evaluation Endpoints**
            - Description: Attacker exploits path traversal vulnerabilities in `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, and `/best-of-n-evals` endpoints by manipulating the `folder` parameters to access files outside of intended evaluation directories.
            - Actionable insights: Implement strict input validation and sanitization for folder path parameters. Use secure file path handling functions and restrict access to evaluation directories.
            - Likelihood: Medium (if input validation is insufficient)
            - Impact: High (potential to read sensitive files on the server)
            - Effort: Medium (requires identifying vulnerable endpoints and crafting path traversal payloads)
            - Skill Level: Medium

    2.  **Exploit Frontend Vulnerabilities**
        - Description: Attacker targets vulnerabilities in the frontend (React/Vite, Javascript) to compromise the application.
        - Actionable insights: Regularly update frontend dependencies (`yarn update`). Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS. Sanitize any user-provided content displayed on the frontend.
        - Likelihood: Low to Medium (depending on frontend code complexity and dependencies)
        - Impact: Medium (potential for XSS, client-side DoS, information disclosure)
        - Effort: Medium (requires understanding frontend code and finding vulnerabilities)
        - Skill Level: Medium
        - Detection Difficulty: Low (client-side vulnerabilities are harder to detect from the server side)

        - 3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
            - Description: If the frontend improperly handles and displays data, especially if future features introduce user-generated content or if backend vulnerabilities allow injecting malicious scripts into responses, XSS vulnerabilities could arise.
            - Actionable insights: Implement robust output encoding and sanitization in the frontend. Use a framework that helps prevent XSS (React helps by default). Implement and enforce Content Security Policy (CSP).
            - Likelihood: Low (React and modern frontend frameworks mitigate XSS risks, but still possible if misimplemented)
            - Impact: Medium (potential to execute malicious scripts in user's browser, session hijacking, defacement)
            - Effort: Medium (requires finding injection points and crafting XSS payloads)
            - Skill Level: Medium
            - Detection Difficulty: Low (client-side attacks are hard to detect from the server side, CSP reporting can help)

    2.  **Exploit Infrastructure Vulnerabilities**
        - Description: Attacker targets misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the infrastructure where the application is deployed (Docker, cloud environment if hosted).
        - Actionable insights: Follow Docker security best practices. Regularly update Docker images and engine. Secure cloud environment configurations (if applicable).
        - Likelihood: Low to Medium (depends on deployment environment security)
        - Impact: High (potential for container escape, broader system compromise, data breach)
        - Effort: Medium to High (requires infrastructure knowledge and finding misconfigurations)
        - Skill Level: Medium to High
        - Detection Difficulty: Medium (infrastructure security monitoring and audits are necessary)

        - 3.  **Docker Container Escape**
            - Description: If Docker is used for deployment and is misconfigured (e.g., running containers in privileged mode, insecure Docker socket exposure), attackers might attempt to escape the container and gain access to the host system.
            - Actionable insights: Follow Docker security best practices: avoid privileged containers, minimize capabilities, securely manage Docker socket access. Regularly audit Docker configurations.
            - Likelihood: Low (if Docker is properly configured) to Medium (if misconfigured)
            - Impact: Critical (full host system compromise)
            - Effort: High (requires advanced Docker exploitation techniques)
            - Skill Level: High
            - Detection Difficulty: Medium to High (container security monitoring and host-based intrusion detection are needed)
