# BUSINESS POSTURE

## Priorities and Goals
1. Accelerate UI development through automated screenshot-to-code conversion
2. Enable rapid prototyping for frontend developers
3. Reduce manual coding efforts for common UI patterns
4. Support multiple output formats (HTML/CSS, React, etc.)

## Business Risks
1. Potential accuracy issues in generated code impacting user trust
2. Dependency on third-party ML models/services
3. Intellectual property protection for training data/models
4. Scalability challenges with image processing workloads
5. Competition from similar AI-powered development tools

# SECURITY POSTURE

## Existing Security Controls
1. Security control: Code review process (implemented via GitHub PR workflow)
2. Security control: Dependency scanning (implemented via GitHub Dependabot)
3. Security control: Basic input validation for image uploads (described in image_processor.py)
4. Security control: Environment separation (development vs production)

## Accepted Risks
1. No formal bug bounty program
2. Limited security testing in CI pipeline
3. No runtime protection for ML models
4. Basic logging implementation

## Recommended Security Controls
1. Implement SAST/DAST scanning in CI pipeline
2. Add model watermarking for IP protection
3. Introduce secret management solution
4. Implement request rate limiting
5. Add anomaly detection for ML inference

## Security Requirements
1. Authentication: OAuth2 for admin access
2. Authorization: Role-based access control for API endpoints
3. Input Validation: Strict file type verification, image size limits
4. Cryptography: TLS 1.3 for data in transit, AES-256 for stored user data

# RISK ASSESSMENT

## Critical Business Processes
1. Image processing pipeline integrity
2. Code generation accuracy
3. User workflow continuity
4. Model training/update process

## Data Protection Requirements
1. User-uploaded screenshots (Confidentiality: Medium)
2. Generated source code (Integrity: High)
3. API keys/secrets (Confidentiality: Critical)
4. Model weights (Confidentiality: High, Integrity: High)

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

## Questions
1. What compliance standards apply (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)?
2. Are there any third-party data processors involved?
3. What's the maximum retention period for user files?
4. Is there disaster recovery plan for ML models?
5. How are model updates validated/tested?

## Assumptions
1. Web-based architecture with REST API
2. Uses pre-trained ML models with fine-tuning
3. Stateless backend with horizontal scaling
4. Cloud-native deployment model
5. Mixed open-source/proprietary components
