Encourage the use of HTTPS to protect tokens in transit. Provide support for secure authentication schemes with built-in protections.       | Low - Attacks require interception of communication and the use of non-secure authentication methods, which are less common over HTTPS connections.                                 | High - Unauthorized access can lead to data breaches, manipulation of resources, and loss of user trust.                                                                         | Medium        |

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

**Questions:**

1. Are there plans to integrate static code analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline to enhance vulnerability detection?
2. What measures are in place to secure the build environment and prevent unauthorized access during the publishing process?
3. How frequently are dependencies audited for security vulnerabilities, and is there a policy for immediate updates when critical issues are discovered?
4. Is there a process for deprecating insecure features or configurations, such as discouraging `verify=False` or insecure authentication methods?
5. Are developers provided with clear guidelines and documentation on best practices for securely using the library?
6. Does the library support certificate revocation checks (CRL or OCSP) to prevent the acceptance of revoked certificates?
7. How is the security impact of accepting certain risks (e.g., dependency vulnerabilities) being monitored and mitigated over time?

**Assumptions:**

- The project team prioritizes security and is open to implementing new controls to address identified risks.
- Developers using the Requests library may not always follow best security practices unless guided or enforced by the library.
- The library aims to maintain backward compatibility, which may impact the ability to deprecate insecure features quickly.
- Dependency management is handled proactively, with updates and patches applied regularly to minimize risks.
- The build and deployment processes are secured using industry-standard practices but may benefit from additional controls like code signing.
- The development and maintenance team has the resources to enhance the test suite and integrate additional security checks.
- Users of the library include a wide range of developers, some of whom may use the library in high-security environments requiring stringent controls.
