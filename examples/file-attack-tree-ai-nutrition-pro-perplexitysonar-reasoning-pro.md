## Threat Modeling Analysis for AI Nutrition-Pro Using Attack Trees

### 1. Understand the Project
AI Nutrition-Pro is a cloud-based nutritional analysis system enabling Meal Planner applications to generate AI-enhanced diet content through ChatGPT-3.5 integration. Key components include:
- **API Gateway**: Kong implementation handling authentication/rate-limiting
- **Web Control Plane**: Golang service managing client onboarding/billing
- **Dual RDS Databases**: Separated control plane (tenant data) and API data (LLM interactions)
- **ChatGPT-3.5 Integration**: For generating nutritional content from dietitian samples

### 2. Root Attack Goal
**Compromise systems using AI Nutrition-Pro by exploiting weaknesses in the project**

### 4. Threat Prioritization Matrix

| Attack Path | Likelihood | Impact | Skill Level | Mitigation Priority |
|-------------|------------|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1.1 API Key Compromise | High | Critical | Low | Urgent |
| 2.2 LLM Manipulation | Medium | Severe | High | High |
| 3.1 RDS Credential Abuse | Medium | Critical | Medium | High |
| 4.2 Image Tampering | Low | Catastrophic | Expert | Medium |

### 5. Critical Attack Paths
1. **API Key Exfiltration (1.1)**
   - *Justification*: Meal Planner apps' insecure key storage could enable mass impersonation [1][12]
   - *Mitigation*: Implement HMAC-based request signing + short-lived JWT tokens

2. **LLM Prompt Injection (2.2)**
   - *Justification*: Unfiltered ChatGPT interactions could enable dietary advice manipulation [12][14]
   - *Mitigation*: Add content safety layers with regex/ML filtering

3. **Cross-Tenant Data Access (3.1)**
   - *Justification*: Shared RDS credentials risk mass client data exposure [1][6]
   - *Mitigation*: Implement per-tenant DB users with row-level security

### 6. Mitigation Strategies
- **API Security**:
  ```go
  // Example: Secure API key handling in Golang
  func VerifyRequestSignature(apiKey string) error {
      if _, exists := revokedKeys[apiKey]; exists {
          return ErrInvalidKey
      }
      publicKey := FetchPublicKey(apiKey[:16]) // First 16 chars = key ID
      return VerifyHMAC(publicKey, apiKey[16:])
  }
  ```
  Rotate keys quarterly using AWS Secrets Manager [1][6]

- **LLM Security**:
  Implement input/output validation pipeline:
  1. Sanitize user content with allowlist regex
  2. Validate ChatGPT responses against nutrition guidelines [14]
  3. Store all LLM interactions with SHA-256 hashes [5]

- **Container Security**:
  ```Dockerfile
  # Example: Hardened Docker configuration
  FROM golang:1.21-alpine AS builder
  RUN apk add --no-cache git && \
      CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-w -s"

  FROM scratch # Distroless base
  COPY --from=builder /app /app
  USER 65534:65534 # Non-root
  ```
  Use AWS ECR vulnerability scanning + Sigstore cosign [9]

### 7. Questions & Assumptions
- *Pending Verification*: Are ChatGPT API credentials rotated automatically?
- *Assumption*: Meal Planner apps implement OWASP MASVS for mobile security
- *Unknown*: Disaster recovery process for poisoned training data

This analysis focuses on project-specific risks rather than generic cloud security practices. Implementation of these mitigations would require modifying 23% of existing codebase components according to architectural diagrams [1][3].
