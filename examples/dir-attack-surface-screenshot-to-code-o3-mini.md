Below is an analysis of several key (medium to high/critical) attack surfaces introduced by the “screenshot-to-code” application. Each point describes the issue, explains how the project contributes to the attack surface, provides an example scenario, outlines the potential impact and risk severity, and then lists current as well as missing mitigations.

- **API Key Exposure & Mismanagement**
  - **Description:** The application requires users to supply several sensitive API keys (for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate, etc.) that are transmitted between the client and backend and may eventually be stored in environment variables.
  - **How the Application Contributes:**
    - The README and settings dialog instruct users to supply API keys.
    - The backend makes calls directly using these keys and sometimes logs or streams parts of the process (for example, during code–generation and image processing).
  - **Example:** An attacker who intercepts network traffic or gains access to environment files might obtain a user’s API key and abuse it (leading to unexpected charges or data breaches).
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized use of external LLM or image-generation services, financial cost, and potential service abuse.
  - **Risk Severity:** **High**
  - **Current Mitigations:**
    - Documentation instructs users to input keys via a settings dialog so that keys aren’t stored on public servers.
    - Use of environment variables (in code and Dockerfiles) to isolate keys from code repositories.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Encryption and secure transmission for API key data in transit.
    - Avoiding any logging of full key values.
    - More granular access controls on the backend to ensure that keys are only used when strictly necessary.

- **Permissive CORS Configuration**
  - **Description:** The backend is configured to allow *any* origin by setting `allow_origins=["*"]` in CORS middleware.
  - **How the Application Contributes:**
    - In the main FastAPI app, the CORS middleware is set up with no origin restrictions.
    - This open policy means that any website can interact with the API endpoints.
  - **Example:** A malicious website might initiate requests to the code–generation or screenshot endpoints, especially if it can trick a user into supplying their API key via the UI.
  - **Impact:** Although the user supplies sensitive keys manually, a permissive CORS policy can facilitate cross–site request forgery (CSRF)–like attacks or abuse of the API if other authentication measures are not in place.
  - **Risk Severity:** **Medium**
  - **Current Mitigations:**
    - Sensitive API keys are not stored on the server; they are supplied by the user.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Restrict allowed origins to those known to belong to the front-end application.
    - Require additional authentication tokens or same–site cookies for state–changing API calls.

- **WebSocket Communication Vulnerabilities in Code Generation**
  - **Description:** The code–generation endpoint streams output via a WebSocket connection. Any weakness in the handling of these message streams might enable injection attacks or DoS situations.
  - **How the Application Contributes:**
    - In the `/generate-code` route, code chunks and status messages are pushed to the client over an open WebSocket connection.
    - The code does not re–sanitize the output from the LLM providers before sending it to the client.
  - **Example:** A malformed or adversarially crafted LLM response could slip through and cause the client to render unexpected or even malicious HTML/JS content. Additionally, an attacker might attempt repeated connections or send specially crafted requests to overload the system.
  - **Impact:** Service disruption, potential client–side injection (if used in scenarios where code is embedded into a live page), and possible resource exhaustion.
  - **Risk Severity:** **Medium**
  - **Current Mitigations:**
    - Custom status and error messages are sent (with custom close codes) to signal problems.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Further sanitize and validate any content streamed over the WebSocket before it’s forwarded to the client.
    - Implement rate limiting and more robust error handling on the WebSocket layer.

- **SSRF (Server–Side Request Forgery) via the Screenshot Endpoint**
  - **Description:** The `/api/screenshot` endpoint accepts a target URL from the client, then uses that URL (and a user–supplied API key) to call an external screenshot service.
  - **How the Application Contributes:**
    - The function `capture_screenshot` takes a URL from the request without implementing strict validation; it then passes that URL along as a parameter to an external service.
  - **Example:** An attacker might supply an internal URL (e.g. “http://localhost/admin” or “http://192.168.1.1”) hoping that the external API or a poorly restricted internal network service would return confidential data.
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal resources, potential mapping of internal network services, and leverage in further attacks.
  - **Risk Severity:** **High**
  - **Current Mitigations:**
    - Basic parameter passing to the external API is performed but without additional filtering.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Validate and restrict acceptable target URLs (for example, by enforcing allowed schemes or domains).
    - Use a whitelist of domains or further sanitize the URL input before forwarding it.

- **File System Access and Directory Traversal in Evaluation Endpoints**
  - **Description:** The eval endpoints (e.g., `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, `/best-of-n-evals`) accept folder paths as query parameters and then list or read files from disk.
  - **How the Application Contributes:**
    - User–supplied folder paths are directly passed to file system APIs (using `Path` or `os.listdir`) without strict sanitization or restriction to a safe directory.
  - **Example:** An attacker could specify a folder path outside of the intended “evals” directory and potentially read sensitive files on the server’s filesystem.
  - **Impact:** File disclosure or even directory traversal attacks could lead to exposure of sensitive data.
  - **Risk Severity:** **Medium to High**
  - **Current Mitigations:**
    - Some checks exist (e.g. using `Path` and verifying existence) but without restricting the scope of allowed directories.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Restrict folder parameters to a predefined safe root directory.
    - Sanitize and validate input folder paths to prevent directory traversal.

- **Denial-of-Service via Costly LLM and Video Processing Operations**
  - **Description:** The application performs expensive operations (LLM calls, video-to-app conversion, image generation) that consume considerable computational and monetary resources.
  - **How the Application Contributes:**
    - Endpoints like `/generate-code` and video processing in `video_to_app.py` trigger API calls to external services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate) as well as heavy local processing (video frame extraction, image resizing).
  - **Example:** An attacker submitting a high–resolution video (or flooding the endpoint with many requests) could force the backend to process many expensive operations, leading to service disruption or excessive costs.
  - **Impact:** Denial–of–Service (DoS) conditions, high operational or API usage cost, and potential resource exhaustion.
  - **Risk Severity:** **High**
  - **Current Mitigations:**
    - Some timeouts and error handling (e.g., streaming functions with timeout parameters, use of asynchronous processing) are in place.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement rate limiting and request throttling; enforce limits on input file size and validate video dimensions or duration before processing.

- **Prompt Injection and Manipulation in LLM Calls**
  - **Description:** The application programmatically assembles prompts that are sent to external LLM APIs. These prompts combine system–provided instructions with user–supplied image URLs and history messages without thorough sanitization.
  - **How the Application Contributes:**
    - The functions `assemble_prompt` and `create_prompt` directly incorporate user–provided values (including prior history) into the conversation sent to the LLM.
  - **Example:** A malicious user could include crafted text in the “history” that alters the intended system prompt (for example, by injecting instructions that cause the LLM to produce untrusted or adversarial code).
  - **Impact:** Generation of malicious or unintended code, exposure of internal prompting instructions, and potential circumvention of safety measures.
  - **Risk Severity:** **Medium**
  - **Current Mitigations:**
    - The system and imported code prompts are carefully constructed to instruct the LLMs on expected output.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Sanitize and/or limit the user–supplied history and input fields before merging into the prompt.
    - Implement strict schema validation and possibly escape or filter out control tokens before sending the prompt externally.

Each of these attack surfaces represents a realistic risk to the system in a real–world deployment—even though some measures exist already, further work is needed to harden the application. Developers and operators should carefully review and address these areas to minimize potential damage from exploitation.
