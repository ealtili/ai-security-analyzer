Here are the mitigation strategies list, focusing only on those directly involving `screenshot-to-code` application and its core functionalities:

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Robust Input Validation and Sanitization for Uploaded Screenshots

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **File Type Validation:**  Ensure only allowed image file types (e.g., `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`) are accepted for uploaded screenshots. Validate the `Content-Type` header and file extension.
        2.  **File Size Limits:**  Enforce a maximum file size limit for uploaded screenshots to prevent excessively large files from consuming server resources during processing.
        3.  **Image Format Validation:** Use an image processing library to verify the image file header and format integrity, confirming it is a valid image and not a disguised malicious file.
        4.  **Image Sanitization:**  Employ image processing libraries to sanitize the image data. Strip potentially malicious metadata (like EXIF data) and re-encode the image to a safe format before further processing by `screenshot-to-code` logic.
        5.  **Error Handling:**  Implement proper error handling to gracefully reject invalid screenshot uploads and provide informative error messages to the user.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious File Upload (High Severity):** Prevents uploading files disguised as images that could contain executable code or exploits, triggered during screenshot processing by `screenshot-to-code`.
        *   **Image Parsing Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Mitigates risks from processing maliciously crafted images that could exploit vulnerabilities in image processing libraries used by `screenshot-to-code`.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large File Uploads (Medium Severity):** Prevents resource exhaustion by limiting the size of uploaded screenshots processed by `screenshot-to-code`.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Malicious File Upload: High Risk Reduction.
        *   Image Parsing Vulnerabilities: Medium Risk Reduction.
        *   DoS via Large File Uploads: High Risk Reduction.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic checks might exist, but robust image format validation and sanitization within the screenshot upload pipeline of `screenshot-to-code` are likely missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Detailed image format validation and sanitization within the screenshot upload and processing pipeline of `screenshot-to-code`.  Specifically in the modules handling image uploads and pre-processing before code generation.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Employ Secure Code Generation Practices

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Templating Engine with Auto-Escaping:** Utilize a templating engine with automatic output escaping to minimize injection risks when `screenshot-to-code` generates code.
        2.  **Context-Aware Escaping:** Implement context-aware escaping within the code generation logic of `screenshot-to-code` to handle different output contexts (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) appropriately.
        3.  **Input Sanitization for Code Generation Logic:**  If user inputs influence code generation in `screenshot-to-code`, sanitize these inputs before incorporating them into code generation templates or logic.
        4.  **Code Review for Generation Logic:**  Conduct thorough code reviews of the code generation logic within `screenshot-to-code` to identify potential injection points or vulnerabilities in the generated code.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated Code (High Severity):** Prevents `screenshot-to-code` from generating code vulnerable to XSS when displayed in a web browser.
        *   **Code Injection (Medium to High Severity, Context Dependent):** Reduces the risk of `screenshot-to-code` generating code that could lead to code injection vulnerabilities in systems consuming the generated code.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   XSS in Generated Code: High Risk Reduction.
        *   Code Injection: Medium to High Risk Reduction.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented, depending on the templating engine used by `screenshot-to-code`. Context-aware escaping and input sanitization for code generation logic might be missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Explicit context-aware escaping in code generation templates of `screenshot-to-code`. Input sanitization specifically for code generation logic within `screenshot-to-code`. Code review focusing on secure code generation is crucial and might be absent. The code generation modules and templates of `screenshot-to-code` are the target areas.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Apply Input Validation and Sanitization to User Prompts/Configurations for Code Generation

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Define Allowed Input Structure:**  Define the expected format for user prompts or configurations used to guide code generation in `screenshot-to-code`.
        2.  **Input Validation at the Interface Layer:** Implement validation checks when user prompts are received by `screenshot-to-code`. Reject invalid inputs and provide clear error messages.
        3.  **Sanitize Special Characters:** Sanitize user inputs to remove or escape special characters that could be used for prompt injection attacks within `screenshot-to-code`.
        4.  **Whitelist Valid Inputs (Where Possible):**  Whitelist valid inputs for prompts instead of blacklisting, defining a set of allowed values or patterns for `screenshot-to-code` to accept.
        5.  **Regular Expression Validation:** Use regular expressions for complex validation of user prompts used by `screenshot-to-code`, ensuring regex patterns are secure.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Prompt Injection/Indirect Prompt Injection (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents attackers from manipulating the code generation process of `screenshot-to-code` using malicious prompts.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Prompts (Medium Severity):** If user prompts are displayed back within the `screenshot-to-code` application without encoding, this mitigation reduces XSS risks.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Prompt Injection/Indirect Prompt Injection: Medium to High Risk Reduction.
        *   XSS through Prompts: Medium Risk Reduction.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic input validation might be in place. Comprehensive sanitization and specific validation against prompt injection attacks in `screenshot-to-code` are less likely.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Robust sanitization and validation of user prompts and configurations within `screenshot-to-code`, specifically to prevent prompt injection attacks. Input validation logic should be enhanced in modules handling user prompts before they are used for code generation.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Output Encoding/Sanitization for Displayed Generated Code

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **HTML Encoding for Web Display:** When displaying generated code from `screenshot-to-code` in a web interface, use HTML encoding to escape special HTML characters.
        2.  **Context-Specific Encoding (If Necessary):** If generated code from `screenshot-to-code` is displayed in other contexts (e.g., JavaScript), use context-specific encoding functions.
        3.  **Use a Templating Engine with Auto-Escaping for Display:**  Ensure auto-escaping is enabled in the templating engine used to display generated code from `screenshot-to-code`.
        4.  **Regularly Review Encoding Implementation:**  Review the code that displays generated code from `screenshot-to-code` to ensure proper encoding is consistently applied.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when Displaying Generated Code (High Severity):** Prevents XSS by ensuring that generated code from `screenshot-to-code` is displayed as text and not executed as scripts in the browser.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   XSS when Displaying Generated Code: High Risk Reduction.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic HTML encoding might be applied. Consistent and comprehensive encoding across all locations where `screenshot-to-code`'s generated code is displayed needs verification.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent HTML encoding (or context-specific encoding) in all parts of the web interface displaying code generated by `screenshot-to-code`. Review frontend code displaying generated code and ensure proper encoding.
