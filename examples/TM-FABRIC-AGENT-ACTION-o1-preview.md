# APPLICATION THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS

- **Fabric Agent Action Codebase**: The source code and configurations of the Fabric Agent Action GitHub repository.
- **API Keys and Secrets**: OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic API keys, and GitHub tokens stored in repository secrets.
- **User Input Data**: Inputs provided by users or workflows, including issue comments and pull request data.
- **Generated Output Data**: Output files and comments generated by the action, which may contain sensitive information.
- **Fabric Patterns**: External patterns downloaded from the Fabric repository, used for processing.
- **Configuration Files**: Files such as `action.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `pyproject.toml`, and scripts.

# BUILD THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS

- **Source Code Repository**: The GitHub repository containing the action's source code.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Workflows used for building, testing, and publishing the action.
- **Dependencies and Packages**: External libraries and packages used in the project (specified in `pyproject.toml`).
- **Build Secrets**: Tokens and keys used during the build process (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`, API keys).
- **Build Artifacts**: Generated files and Docker images from the build process.
- **GitHub Actions Runners**: The environment where builds and tests are executed.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- **Questions:**
  - Are there any input validation and sanitization mechanisms currently implemented for user-provided data?
  - How are secrets and API keys managed, and are there rotation policies in place?
  - Is there a process for verifying the integrity of the Fabric Patterns downloaded from external repositories?
  - Are there any monitoring or alerting systems for detecting unusual activities in the GitHub Actions workflows?
  - Do the CI/CD pipelines include security scanning for vulnerabilities in dependencies and code?

- **Assumptions:**
  - Users interacting with the action via issues or pull requests may be untrusted and can submit any content.
  - The GitHub Runner environment is considered trusted but could be a target for attackers if not properly secured.
  - Secrets stored in GitHub are assumed to be protected by GitHub's standard security measures.
  - External dependencies (LLM Providers, Fabric Patterns) are assumed to be trustworthy unless compromised.
  - The team follows standard security best practices unless specified otherwise in the project files.
