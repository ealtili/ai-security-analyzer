DEPLOYMENT THREAT MODEL

### ASSETS

- **GitHub Runner Environment**: The virtual machine provided by GitHub Actions where the workflows run.

- **Action Docker Image**: The Docker image (`ghcr.io/xvnpw/fabric-agent-action:v1`) used to execute the action.

- **Repository Code**: The codebase of the repository using the action, which may be accessed during action execution.

- **Secrets in Runner Environment**: Sensitive information (API keys, tokens) exposed as environment variables during the action run.

- **Workflow Artifacts**: Any files or data generated during the workflow execution.

### TRUST BOUNDARIES

- **Runner Environment Boundary**: Separates the isolated runner environment from the GitHub cloud infrastructure and external networks.

- **Docker Container Boundary**: The Docker container isolates the action's execution from the runner's host environment.

- **Network Boundary**: Interactions between the runner environment and external services (LLM APIs, artifact storage).

- **Secrets Boundary**: Controls access to secrets stored in the runner environment, ensuring they aren't exposed to unauthorized processes.

BUILD THREAT MODEL

### ASSETS

- **Source Code Repository**: The action's codebase, which needs to maintain integrity throughout the build process.

- **Dependencies**: External libraries and packages specified in `pyproject.toml` and managed by Poetry.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Workflows defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` and `publish.yaml` that automate build, test, and deployment processes.

- **Docker Images**: Built images of the action that are pushed to `ghcr.io` and used in deployments.

- **Credentials for Package Registry**: `GITHUB_TOKEN` and possibly other credentials used to authenticate with GitHub Container Registry and other services.

### TRUST BOUNDARIES

- **Source Code Boundary**: Separates trusted internal code from external code contributions and dependencies.

- **CI Runner Boundary**: The environment where CI jobs run is isolated from external networks and systems.

- **Dependency Boundary**: Interaction between the build process and the external repositories where dependencies are fetched.

- **Package Registry Boundary**: The interface between the CI/CD pipeline and the container registry where Docker images are pushed and stored.

Rotate secrets regularly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Low likelihood with proper access controls, but insider threats or credential compromise pose risks.                                                                                                                                  | High impact if CI pipeline is compromised, potentially leading to code tampering or exposure of credentials used in deployments.                                                                                      | Medium        |
| 2003      | Docker Image Publishing | Tampering with Docker images during build or publish process                                               | During the build and publish steps, Docker images could be tampered with if the build environment or registry is compromised, leading to malicious images being distributed.                                                   | The publish workflow uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication and builds images in controlled CI environment. Reference: `publish.yaml` workflow automates the process with defined steps and permissions.                                                                                                                                  | Implement image signing (e.g., using Docker's Content Trust) to ensure integrity. Use separate credentials with limited scope for image publishing. Monitor the container registry for unauthorized changes. Consider using security scanning tools for images before publishing.                                                                                                                                                              | Low likelihood if CI environment and credentials are secure. Risk increases if credentials are compromised or if there's a vulnerability in the CI environment.                                                                        | High impact as compromised images can affect all downstream users, introducing vulnerabilities or malicious code into their environments.                                                                                 | Medium        |
| 2004      | CI Runner Environment  | Insecure CI runner leading to exposure of secrets or code during the build process                         | The CI runner processes the code and has access to secrets like `GITHUB_TOKEN`. If the runner environment is insecure or compromised, sensitive information could be exposed.                                                  | GitHub-hosted runners are used, which have isolation and ephemeral instances. Reference: Runners are managed by GitHub with security measures in place.                                                                                                                                              | Ensure that no sensitive data is logged during CI jobs. Use `actions/checkout` with `persist-credentials: false` to prevent saving credentials. Review CI job configurations for potential leaks. If self-hosted runners are used, implement strong security controls.                                                                                                                                                                | Low likelihood due to GitHub's management of hosted runners. Risk exists if misconfigured workflows expose data.                                                                                                                      | Moderate impact if secrets are exposed, leading to further compromise of repositories or services.                                                                                                | Low           |
| 2005      | Build Artifacts        | Leakage of sensitive information through build artifacts or logs                                           | Build artifacts and logs may contain sensitive information like environment variables, code, or error messages that could be exploited if accessed by unauthorized parties.                                                    | Artifacts and logs are stored in GitHub Actions with controlled access. Reference: Access is limited to those with appropriate repository permissions. Logs are visible in the Actions tab for those with access.                                                                                                                   | Review CI job outputs to ensure sensitive information is not logged. Implement log sanitization where necessary. Limit who has access to build logs and artifacts by adjusting repository permissions. Consider using encrypted artifacts if they contain sensitive data.                                                                                                                                                                   | Medium likelihood if developers inadvertently log sensitive data. Risks are reduced with proper practices.                                                                                                                            | Moderate impact if exposed information aids attackers in exploiting other vulnerabilities or accessing systems.                                                                                   | Medium        |

### QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
