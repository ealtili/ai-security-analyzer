Threat Modeling Analysis for AI Nutrition-Pro Using Attack Trees

1. Project Overview
   • Name: AI Nutrition-Pro
   • Purpose: Provides AI-driven nutrition content generation via a backend API integrated with ChatGPT-3.5 and managed by a Web Control Plane.
   • Key Components:
     – API Gateway (Kong): client authentication, input filtering, rate limiting
     – Web Control Plane (Golang on AWS ECS): tenant onboarding, configuration, billing
     – Control Plane DB (Amazon RDS)
     – API Application (Golang on AWS ECS): AI functionality
     – API DB (Amazon RDS)
     – External Integrations: Meal Planner apps (REST/HTTPS) and ChatGPT-3.5 (REST/HTTPS)
   • Dependencies: AWS ECS, RDS, Kong, Golang, TLS, OpenAI APIs

2. Root Goal of the Attack Tree
   “Compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of AI Nutrition-Pro and its client data by exploiting weaknesses in the project.”

3. High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)

7. Analysis & Prioritization
   • Highest Risk Paths:
     – B3 (Misconfigured ACL) – low effort, high impact
     – A1/A4 (Phishing or insecure key storage) – common and easy
     – F2 (Flood ChatGPT for DoS) – trivial to execute
   • Critical Nodes:
     – API Gateway ACL rules and input filters
     – Secure storage and rotation of API keys
     – Rate-limiting and quotas on ChatGPT calls
   • Feasibility: Misconfiguration and credential theft are easiest; supply chain attacks require more effort but have severe impact.

8. Mitigation Strategies
   A. API Key Protection
     – Enforce strong, random key generation
     – Require per-client secret rotation and secure storage
     – Implement anomaly detection on key usage
   B. API Gateway Hardening
     – Keep Kong up to date; apply security patches
     – Audit and tighten ACL rules; avoid wildcard permissions
     – Enforce strict input validation; use a WAF
     – Enforce strong TLS configurations
   C. Backend & Control Plane Security
     – Perform secure-coding practices: parameterize queries, avoid shell calls
     – Conduct static analysis and code reviews
     – Enforce RBAC and session management in control plane
     – Sanitize all user inputs; escape outputs in UI
   D. Data Store Protections
     – Lock down RDS security groups; disable public access
     – Apply least-privilege IAM roles for DB access
     – Encrypt backups; store snapshots in secure vault
   E. Supply Chain Defenses
     – Sign and verify container images (e.g. Docker Content Trust)
     – Use a private, hardened registry; enforce image scanning
     – Vet Go module dependencies; lock down go.mod
     – Secure CI/CD credentials; implement pipeline security
   F. LLM Integration Controls
     – Use prompt templates and whitelist tokens/variables
     – Rate-limit and quota ChatGPT requests per client
     – Validate and sanitize LLM outputs before storing or forwarding

9. Summary of Key Findings
   – The most realistic and high-impact threats stem from misconfigurations (Gateway ACL, RDS SG) and credential compromise.
   – Prompt injection and DoS on LLM are medium risk but easy to execute; rate-limiting and sanitization are critical.
   – Supply chain attacks are harder but devastating; enforce image signing and dependency vetting.

10. Questions & Assumptions
   • Assumed CI/CD pipeline exists and builds Docker images.
   • No file-upload feature, so file-based attacks are out of scope.
   • Assumed API keys are long and random unless mismanaged by clients.
   • Questions:
     1. Are RDS instances publicly accessible by default?
     2. How are container images built, signed, and deployed?
     3. Is there existing logging/monitoring of anomalous API key usage?
