# Mitigation Strategies for AI Nutrition-Pro

## 1. Enhanced API Key Management

**Description:**
- Implement API key rotation on a regular schedule (every 30-90 days)
- Use short-lived tokens instead of persistent API keys where possible
- Store API keys securely using AWS Secrets Manager
- Implement key revocation procedures for compromised keys
- Use different API keys for different environments (dev, staging, production)

**Threats Mitigated:**
- Unauthorized access to API endpoints (High severity) - Reduces risk of persistent access if keys are compromised
- API key leakage (High severity) - Regular rotation limits the impact window of exposure

**Impact:**
- Significantly reduces the risk window during which compromised API keys can be exploited
- Provides quick remediation path in case of credential exposure

- Implement output filtering to prevent sensitive data leakage
- Set up contextual boundaries in prompts to resist manipulation

**Threats Mitigated:**
- LLM prompt injection attacks (High severity) - Prevents manipulation of ChatGPT responses
- Data leakage through LLM (Medium severity) - Controls what information can be exposed
- Prompt poisoning (High severity) - Prevents attackers from manipulating AI-generated content

**Impact:**
- Significantly reduces the risk of LLM manipulation
- Prevents attackers from using the LLM to access unauthorized information
- Ensures consistent, safe AI-generated content

**Currently Implemented:**
- No specific LLM security controls are mentioned in the architecture

**Missing Implementation:**
- Input sanitization for LLM prompts

## 4. Database Access Controls and Encryption

**Description:**
- Implement database-level encryption at rest for both Control Plane DB and API DB
- Use column-level encryption for particularly sensitive data (billing information, API keys)
- Implement strict access controls following principle of least privilege
- Create separate database users for different functionality with minimal required permissions
- Configure network security groups to restrict DB access to only necessary application components

**Threats Mitigated:**
- Data leakage from databases (High severity) - Reduces risk and impact of unauthorized access
- Tenant data isolation breaches (High severity) - Prevents access across tenant boundaries
- Database credential compromise (Medium severity) - Limits impact if credentials are exposed

**Impact:**
- Significantly reduces the risk of data exposure in case of infrastructure compromise
- Creates multiple layers of protection around sensitive data

**Currently Implemented:**
- TLS is used for database connections according to the architecture diagram
- Database separation between control plane and API functionality is implemented

**Missing Implementation:**
- Column-level encryption for sensitive data
- Detailed least-privilege access controls
- Network security groups for database isolation

## 5. Advanced API Gateway Security Configuration

**Description:**
- Implement detailed request validation and schema enforcement at the API Gateway
- Configure advanced WAF rules to detect and block common attack patterns
- Set up multi-layered rate limiting (global, per-endpoint, and per-tenant)
- Implement traffic pattern analysis to detect anomalous behavior
- Configure mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service authentication

**Threats Mitigated:**
- API abuse (High severity) - Prevents misuse of API services
- Denial of service attacks (Medium severity) - Protects application availability
- API gateway bypass attempts (High severity) - Ensures all traffic flows through proper controls

**Impact:**
- Creates a strong perimeter defense for all API interactions
- Reduces attack surface by validating all incoming requests
- Prevents resource exhaustion through sophisticated rate limiting

**Currently Implemented:**
- Basic API Gateway with authentication, input filtering, and rate limiting is in place

**Missing Implementation:**
- Detailed request validation/schema enforcement
- WAF rule configuration
- Multi-layered rate limiting
- Traffic pattern analysis
- mTLS implementation

## 6. Secure Admin Interface Controls

**Description:**
- Implement multi-factor authentication for all administrator access to the Web Control Plane
- Create role-based access controls with granular permissions
- Establish IP restriction for admin interface access
- Implement session timeout and automatic logout
- Set up admin action logging and alerting for sensitive operations

**Threats Mitigated:**
- Admin interface compromise (Critical severity) - Prevents unauthorized admin access
- Privilege escalation (High severity) - Limits damage if access is gained
- Insider threats (Medium severity) - Creates accountability for administrative actions

**Impact:**
- Significantly reduces risk of unauthorized administrative access
- Creates accountability and auditability for admin actions
- Limits damage potential if credentials are compromised

**Currently Implemented:**
- Administrator role is defined but specific security controls are not detailed

**Missing Implementation:**
- Multi-factor authentication
- IP restrictions
- Granular role-based permissions
- Session timeout configuration
- Admin action logging and alerting

## 7. Secure LLM Integration

**Description:**
- Store ChatGPT API credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
- Implement credential rotation for LLM access
- Create separate API keys for different environments
