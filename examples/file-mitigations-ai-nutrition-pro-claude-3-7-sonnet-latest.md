# AI Nutrition-Pro Mitigation Strategies

## 1. Multi-tenant Data Isolation

- **Description**: Implement strict data isolation between different Meal Planner clients by:
  1. Using tenant identifiers in all database tables
  2. Creating database views that automatically filter by tenant
  3. Implementing application-level checks before any data access
  4. Consider separate schema or database instances for high-risk clients

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Data leakage between tenants (High severity) - prevents one client from accessing another client's dietitian content samples or AI-generated content
  - Accidental data cross-contamination (Medium severity)

- **Impact**: Completely prevents unauthorized cross-tenant data access, ensuring each Meal Planner application only accesses its own data, protecting client confidentiality and intellectual property.

- **Currently Implemented**: Not explicitly mentioned in the architecture document.

- **Missing Implementation**: Needs to be implemented in both API database and Control Plane database design, with appropriate filtering in the API Application and Web Control Plane.

## 2. Data Minimization for LLM Requests

- **Description**: Implement a data filtering system that:
  1. Strips personally identifiable information before sending to ChatGPT
  2. Removes specific dietitian identifiers
  3. Sanitizes proprietary methodologies or trade secrets
  4. Uses templates with placeholders instead of raw data

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Leakage of proprietary dietitian content to OpenAI (High severity)
  - Exposure of personal information through LLM (Medium severity)
  - Training data poisoning of public LLM (Medium severity)

- **Impact**: Significantly reduces risk of sensitive information being sent to external AI systems while maintaining quality of AI-generated nutrition content.

- **Currently Implemented**: No evidence in architecture document of data filtering before LLM interaction.

- **Missing Implementation**: Should be added to API Application logic when communicating with ChatGPT-3.5.

## 3. Advanced API Key Management

- **Description**: Enhance API key security by:
  1. Implementing automatic key rotation policies (e.g., quarterly)
  2. Creating a key revocation system for compromised keys
  3. Adding request signing requirements beyond simple key authentication
  4. Implementing per-endpoint usage restrictions tied to API keys

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - API key theft or compromise (High severity)
  - Unauthorized API usage (High severity)
  - Service abuse by authorized clients (Medium severity)

- **Impact**: Reduces the impact window of compromised credentials and provides fine-grained control over API access.

- **Currently Implemented**: Basic API key authentication mentioned, but no details on rotation or revocation.

- **Missing Implementation**: Enhanced key management features in API Gateway and Control Plane.

## 4. Prompt Injection Protection

- **Description**: Secure the ChatGPT integration by:
  1. Using structured prompts with clear boundaries between instructions and user input
  2. Implementing input validation specific to prompt injection patterns
  3. Creating a library of safe prompt templates
  4. Testing prompts against known injection techniques

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Prompt injection attacks manipulating AI output (High severity)
  - Extraction of system information through carefully crafted inputs (Medium severity)
  - Manipulation of AI to generate harmful content (Medium severity)

- **Impact**: Prevents attackers from hijacking AI functionality through malicious inputs, ensuring generated nutrition content remains safe and appropriate.

- **Currently Implemented**: Not mentioned in architecture.

- **Missing Implementation**: Should be added to API Application's LLM integration component.

## 5. Output Content Filtering

- **Description**: Implement post-processing of AI-generated content by:
  1. Creating a validation layer that scans for inappropriate or harmful content
  2. Adding keyword/phrase blacklists specific to nutrition and health safety
  3. Implementing pattern detection for dangerous advice
  4. Adding human review for flagged content

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Distribution of harmful nutrition advice (High severity)
  - Generation of inappropriate content (Medium severity)
  - Bypass of dietary safety guidelines (High severity)

- **Impact**: Ensures all AI-generated nutrition content meets safety standards before being delivered to dietitians or end users.

- **Currently Implemented**: Not mentioned in architecture.

- **Missing Implementation**: Should be implemented in API Application before returning LLM-generated content.

## 6. API Endpoint Authorization Matrix

- **Description**: Enhance authorization by:
  1. Creating a detailed matrix of allowed operations per client
  2. Implementing fine-grained permissions for each API endpoint
  3. Adding context-aware authorization (time, location, request frequency)
  4. Creating different permission tiers for access to sensitive nutrition data or AI features

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Unauthorized feature access (Medium severity)
  - API function abuse (Medium severity)
  - Privilege escalation (Medium severity)

- **Impact**: Ensures each Meal Planner application has access only to appropriate functionality, preventing misuse of premium features or access to unauthorized data.

- **Currently Implemented**: Basic ACL rules mentioned in API Gateway but likely lacking granularity.

- **Missing Implementation**: More comprehensive authorization rules in API Gateway and potentially additional checks in API Application.

## 7. LLM Request/Response Monitoring

- **Description**: Implement specialized monitoring for LLM interactions:
  1. Create pattern recognition for suspicious prompt patterns
  2. Monitor and analyze all requests to detect attempts to extract sensitive data
  3. Implement automated alerts for unusual usage patterns
  4. Create dashboards for LLM usage statistics and anomalies

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Systematic prompt injection attacks (Medium severity)
  - Attempts to misuse AI capabilities (Medium severity)
  - Data exfiltration attempts through LLM (Medium severity)

- **Impact**: Provides visibility into potential misuse or attacks targeting the AI component, enabling early detection and response.

- **Currently Implemented**: Storage of requests/responses in API database mentioned, but no indication of monitoring.

- **Missing Implementation**: Add analysis and alerting capabilities for LLM interactions in API Application.

## 8. Enhanced Administrative Access Controls

- **Description**: Strengthen administrator security by:
  1. Implementing multi-factor authentication for all administrative access
  2. Creating granular admin roles with specific permissions
  3. Adding IP restriction for administrative functions
  4. Implementing session management with automatic timeouts
  5. Adding approval workflows for sensitive administrative actions

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Administrative account compromise (High severity)
  - Insider threats (Medium severity)
  - Privilege escalation (Medium severity)

- **Impact**: Significantly reduces the risk of administrator account compromise and limits potential damage from compromised accounts.

- **Currently Implemented**: Administrator role mentioned but no details on access controls.

- **Missing Implementation**: Should be implemented in Web Control Plane for administrator access.
