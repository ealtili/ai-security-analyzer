- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - High severity: Leaked or stolen API keys leading to unauthorized access
  - Medium severity: Continued access after client relationship termination
  - Medium severity: Brute force attacks against weak API keys
- **Impact**: Significantly reduces the window of opportunity if API keys are compromised and ensures quick response to security incidents
- **Currently Implemented**: Basic API key authentication exists in API Gateway
- **Missing Implementation**: Rotation mechanisms, expiration policies, revocation workflows, and key strength enforcement

## 2. Request Rate Limiting and Throttling

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Granular Rate Limiting Policies
- **Description**:
  1. Implement client-specific rate limits based on subscription tier
  2. Configure separate rate limits for different API endpoints based on sensitivity
  3. Set up progressive throttling that gradually slows responses rather than hard blocking
  4. Create allowlist mechanisms for legitimate high-volume users
- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - High severity: DoS attacks targeting the API
  - Medium severity: Cost escalation attacks via ChatGPT API
  - Low severity: API scraping and data harvesting
- **Impact**: Protects system availability while controlling costs associated with external LLM API usage
- **Currently Implemented**: Basic rate limiting is mentioned in the API Gateway
- **Missing Implementation**: Endpoint-specific limits, progressive throttling, cost-control mechanisms

## 3. Advanced Input Validation

- **Mitigation Strategy**: LLM Prompt Injection Protection
- **Description**:
  1. Create a structured prompt template system that validates all user-provided content
  2. Implement content sanitization to remove potential injection commands
  3. Set up a request quarantine system for suspicious inputs
  4. Use parameterized prompts that separate user input from instructions sent to the LLM
- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - High severity: Prompt injection attacks against ChatGPT
  - Medium severity: Data exfiltration through prompt manipulation
  - High severity: Prompt attacks that generate harmful dietary advice
- **Impact**: Prevents attackers from manipulating the LLM to generate unauthorized or harmful content
- **Currently Implemented**: Input filtering is mentioned in API Gateway but specifics are unclear
- **Missing Implementation**: Structured prompt templates, sanitization rules specific to LLM prompts, parameterized prompt system

## 4. Content Safety Verification

- **Mitigation Strategy**: AI Output Verification Framework
- **Description**:
  1. Implement a two-stage verification process where generated content is analyzed before delivery
  2. Create a nutritional safety classifier to detect potentially harmful dietary advice
  3. Set up an automated system to flag medically suspect recommendations for human review
  4. Maintain a blocklist of prohibited advice patterns
- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - High severity: Generation of harmful or dangerous nutritional advice
  - Medium severity: Reputational damage from inaccurate content
  - High severity: Legal liability from harmful advice
- **Impact**: Ensures that all AI-generated content meets safety standards before reaching end users
- **Currently Implemented**: No verification system is mentioned
- **Missing Implementation**: Content verification pipeline, safety classifiers, human review workflow

## 5. Database Encryption Enhancement

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Comprehensive Database Encryption
- **Description**:
  1. Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data in both databases
  2. Set up column-level encryption for dietary information and user data
  3. Implement client-side encryption for particularly sensitive data
  4. Create separated encryption key management from database credentials
- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - High severity: Unauthorized access to sensitive nutritional data
  - Medium severity: Database dump exfiltration
  - High severity: Exposure of personal health information
- **Impact**: Ensures that even if database access is compromised, sensitive data remains protected
- **Currently Implemented**: TLS for database connections is mentioned, but no specifics on data encryption
- **Missing Implementation**: Field-level encryption, client-side encryption, separate key management

## 6. Tenant Isolation

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Enhanced Multi-tenant Isolation
- **Description**:
  1. Implement logical separation of tenant data in the database using row-level security
  2. Create tenant-specific encryption keys
  3. Set up isolated processing queues for each tenant's requests
  4. Implement tenant context throughout the application stack
- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - High severity: Cross-tenant data access
  - Medium severity: Unauthorized access to other client's information
  - Medium severity: Tenant privilege escalation
- **Impact**: Prevents data leakage between different Meal Planner applications and their customers
- **Currently Implemented**: No specific tenant isolation is mentioned
- **Missing Implementation**: Row-level security, tenant-specific encryption, tenant context in application code

## 7. Secure External Communication

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Enhanced OpenAI API Integration Security
- **Description**:
  1. Implement IP allowlisting for ChatGPT API access
  2. Set up a dedicated proxy service for all OpenAI API calls
  3. Create a circuit breaker pattern to handle API failures gracefully
  4. Implement request/response logging with PII redaction
- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Medium severity: Man-in-the-middle attacks on OpenAI communication
  - High severity: API key compromise for OpenAI services
  - Medium severity: Data leakage through the external API
- **Impact**: Secures the critical dependency on external AI services and protects sensitive data
- **Currently Implemented**: Basic HTTPS/REST communication is mentioned
- **Missing Implementation**: Dedicated proxy, IP restrictions, circuit breaker implementation, secure logging

## 8. Administrative Access Controls

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Privileged Access Management
- **Description**:
  1. Implement just-in-time administrative access that expires after a short period
  2. Create separate role-based permissions for different administrative functions
  3. Set up multi-factor authentication for all administrative access
  4. Implement privileged session recording and monitoring
- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - High severity: Administrator account compromise
  - High severity: Insider threats from privileged users
  - Medium severity: Accidental system misconfiguration
- **Impact**: Significantly reduces the risk of administrative privilege abuse or compromise
- **Currently Implemented**: Basic administrator role is mentioned but no specific controls
- **Missing Implementation**: Just-in-time access, granular role definitions, MFA, session monitoring
