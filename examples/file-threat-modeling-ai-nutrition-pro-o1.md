## APPLICATION THREAT MODEL

### ASSETS
1. **Control Plane Database (control_plan_db)**
   - Stores all data related to tenant onboarding, billing information, and configuration details.

2. **API Database (api_db)**
   - Contains samples of dietitians' content, as well as requests and responses to the LLM for the AI Nutrition-Pro functionality.

3. **API Gateway (Kong)**
   - Manages authentication, rate limiting, and filtering of inputs. Holds critical configuration (API keys, ACL rules).

4. **Web Control Plane (app_control_plane)**
   - Handles administrative functions including onboarding of new clients and management of billing data. Stores and manages references to control_plan_db.

5. **API Application (backend_api)**
   - Provides AI Nutrition-Pro functionality. Needs to protect logic that uses ChatGPT and ensures integrity of requests/responses.

6. **Administrator Account**
   - Has privileged access to configure the Web Control Plane and system settings.

7. **Meal Planner Application Credentials**
   - API keys for each Meal Planner application, used for authentication at the API Gateway.

8. **Network Communications**
   - Connections from Meal Planner to API Gateway, from Gateway to backend_api, from backend_api to ChatGPT, and from control plane to its database.

### TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **Meal Planner Application to API Gateway**
   - The Meal Planner application is external/untrusted, while the API Gateway is part of the AI Nutrition-Pro trusted environment.

2. **API Gateway to Internal Services**
   - Once traffic passes through the API Gateway, it is considered within the AI Nutrition-Pro environment (trusted). This boundary includes interactions with the backend_api.

3. **Administrator to Web Control Plane**
   - The Administrator device (untrusted) communicates with the Web Control Plane in a trusted zone.

4. **API Application to ChatGPT**
   - Communication with ChatGPT is an external call; ChatGPT is outside of the AI Nutrition-Pro environment.

5. **Web Control Plane to Control Plane Database**
   - The Web Control Plane is a trusted component; the database is also in a trusted zone, but still forms a boundary where data is stored.

6. **Backend API to API Database**
   - The backend API is trusted, but the database is a distinct system that stores potentially sensitive content.

### DATA FLOWS
1. **Meal Planner Application → API Gateway → Backend API**
   - Inbound requests seeking AI content generation. Crosses the external to internal boundary.

2. **Backend API → ChatGPT**
   - Outbound requests for generating AI-based dietary content. Crosses internal to external boundary.

3. **Backend API → API Database**
   - Internal flow to store or retrieve dietitians' content samples, requests, and responses. Remains within trusted environment but still an identifiable boundary.

4. **Administrator → Web Control Plane → Control Plane Database**
   - Administrative flow to configure system settings, manage billing data. Internal, but the Admin device is external/untrusted.

## DEPLOYMENT THREAT MODEL

Below is a sample single deployment scenario:
- AI Nutrition-Pro is deployed on AWS ECS with separate containers for API Gateway (Kong), Web Control Plane, and Backend API.
- Control Plane Database and API Database are Amazon RDS instances within private subnets.
- External requests go through an AWS Load Balancer, then to API Gateway (for meal planner traffic) or directly to Web Control Plane (for admin traffic).

### ASSETS
1. **AWS ECS Cluster**
   - Runs Docker containers for API Gateway, Web Control Plane, and Backend API.

2. **Amazon RDS Instances**
   - Host the control_plane_db and api_db. Contain sensitive configuration, client data.

3. **Networking Infrastructure (VPC, subnets, security groups)**
   - Governs how traffic flows between containers, load balancers, and RDS instances.

4. **Load Balancer**
   - Exposes public endpoints to meal planner apps or the Administrator.

5. **Deployment Configuration (IAM roles, ECS task definitions)**
   - Holds permissions, security group references, container launch parameters.

### TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **Public Internet to AWS Load Balancer**
   - Internet traffic hits the AWS load balancer before being routed internally.

2. **AWS Load Balancer to ECS Services**
   - The load balancer sends traffic to the relevant ECS tasks (API Gateway or Web Control Plane).

3. **ECS Services to RDS**
   - Encrypted connections from containers to RDS in private subnets.

4. **IAM Roles and Policies**
   - Control what each ECS task and administrative user can do within the AWS environment.

## BUILD THREAT MODEL

Assume a Docker-based build pipeline that produces container images for API Gateway, Web Control Plane, and Backend API, then pushes them to a private container registry (e.g., Amazon ECR). The product is then deployed using AWS ECS task definitions.

### ASSETS
1. **Source Code Repositories**
   - Contain the Golang code for the Web Control Plane and Backend API, plus Kong configurations.

2. **Build Pipeline Configuration**
   - Includes scripts that build Docker images, references to container registry, and any third-party dependencies.

3. **Docker Images and Image Registry**
   - Final container images that are deployed to ECS.

4. **Credentials for Push/Pull**
   - Credentials that allow the pipeline to push images to the registry and ECS to pull images from the registry.

### TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **Developer/CI Environment to Source Repositories**
   - Developers or CI pipeline have write access to code that shapes the final product.

2. **CI Pipeline to Docker Registry**
   - Pipeline must authenticate to publish images.

3. **Docker Registry to ECS**
   - ECS must be allowed to pull images for deployment.

|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 0001      | Source Code Repository  | Injection of malicious code by unauthorized contributors          | Attackers contribute malicious code or config to the repository, which will be built and deployed. | Possibly mitigated by access control on the repo.                                          | Enforce code reviews, use branch protection.                                                                          | Low. Generally requires admin or contributor access, or a repo compromise.       | High. Malicious code runs in production, potentially exfiltrating data.         | High         |
| 0002      | Build Pipeline          | Compromise of build scripts leading to untrusted final container  | If attackers modify build scripts or Dockerfiles, the final image might contain backdoors.        | Not mentioned how pipeline security is enforced.                                          | Secure CI environment with restricted access. Validate final images’ contents before deploying.                                                           | Medium. Automated pipelines can be targeted with some effort.                   | High. Production containers could be fully compromised from the start.          | High         |
| 0003      | Docker Registry         | Unauthorized access to private images                             | If registry credentials leak, attackers can pull images and inspect or tamper with them.          | Access might be restricted by IAM roles or tokens.                                         | Strictly control registry credentials. Give read/pull access only to ECS tasks that need it.                                                                | Medium. Stealing or leaking credentials from dev or CI systems is not uncommon. | Medium. Attackers gain knowledge of code and configuration, potentially re-deploy or modify images.                  | Medium       |
| 0004      | Docker Images           | Dependency supply chain attack                                    | Malicious base images or third-party layers can introduce vulnerabilities or malicious software.   | Not explicitly stated, but typically mitigated by using trusted base images.              | Pin base images to specific versions, regularly vet third-party dependencies.                                                                           | Medium. Attackers often target widely used images or dependencies.              | High. Could affect all containers, leading to broad compromise at runtime.       | High         |
| 0005      | Build Pipeline Credentials | Leakage of credentials for pushing images to repository            | If credentials for Docker registry or ECS are exposed in logs/env variables, attackers can push rogue images. | Not covered in the doc.                                                                    | Store credentials securely (avoid plain text), rotate credentials, limit usage to pipeline scope.                                                        | Medium. Attackers who gain access to pipeline logs or env can exfiltrate them.  | Medium. Rogue images in the registry could be deployed to production.            | Medium       |

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
1. **Questions**
   - How exactly does the API Gateway’s admin interface restrict changes to gateway configuration?
   - Are tenant-specific policies enforced in the backend API to avoid cross-tenant data exposure?
   - Is there any centralized user management for the Administrator accounts, such as MFA or short-lived credentials?
   - How are ChatGPT credentials managed and secured?
   - Does the build pipeline use a trusted base image or known secure dependencies?

2. **Assumptions**
   - All RDS instances are configured in private subnets with no direct public access.
   - API Gateway is configured to authenticate external traffic with unique API keys per Meal Planner.
   - Deployment uses least privilege IAM roles for each ECS task, though details are not specified.
   - Build process uses a private Docker registry, and only authorized CI/CD pipelines can push images.

These threats and assumptions are tailored to the AI Nutrition-Pro architecture described in the file. They focus on potential application, deployment, and build process risks specific to the system.
