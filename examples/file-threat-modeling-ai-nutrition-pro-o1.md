# APPLICATION THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS
1. **Control Plane Data (tenant, billing, configuration)**
   Contains sensitive tenant onboarding details, billing information, system configuration.

2. **API Keys for Meal Planner Applications**
   Each integrated Meal Planner application has a unique API key; compromise of this key can lead to unauthorized access.

3. **Dietitian Content Samples and Generated Responses**
   Intellectual property and sensitive content used to build nutrition plans. Stored in API database.

4. **Administrator Credentials**
   Allows full management of AI Nutrition-Pro system. Compromise can lead to complete system takeover.

5. **ChatGPT Interaction Data**
   Requests and responses exchanged with the ChatGPT API, which may contain sensitive client data.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **Meal Planner Application to API Gateway**
   External boundary where Meal Planner applications communicate with AI Nutrition-Pro.

2. **API Gateway to API Application**
   Internal boundary within AI Nutrition-Pro. Gateway enforces authentication and filtering.

3. **Web Control Plane to Control Plane Database**
   Internal boundary where the Web Control Plane manages data in Control Plane DB.

4. **API Application to API Database**
   Internal boundary where API Application reads/writes dietitian content samples and AI responses.

5. **API Application to ChatGPT**
   External boundary for calling the ChatGPT service from AI Nutrition-Pro.

6. **Administrator to Web Control Plane**
   Boundary for administrative access to system configurations.

# BUILD THREAT MODEL

We assume a Docker-based build process for Golang services, with code stored in a repository and images pushed to a container registry. The build may be done locally or via a CI system (not clearly specified).

## ASSETS
1. **Source Code**
   The Golang code base for both API Application and Web Control Plane.

2. **Dockerfiles and Build Scripts**
   Defines how containers are built and dependencies are fetched.

3. **Container Registry**
   Stores built images for deployment to ECS.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **Source Code Repository**
   Controls read/write to the code base. Could be GitHub, GitLab, or another platform.

2. **Build Environment**
   Where the code is compiled and images are created. Could be local, or a CI pipeline environment.

3. **Registry**
   Where final images are pushed. Access control to the registry is critical to prevent malicious overwrite.

| 0001      | Source Code      | Injection of malicious code or libraries                         | If an attacker obtains write access to the repo, they can add malicious code to the build     | Access to repository is restricted to authorized developers                                                 | Implement branch protections and code review requirements (e.g., pull requests) to detect unauthorized or suspicious changes.                           | Medium likelihood if repository access is not well managed                                               | Could compromise every service built and deployed, leading to wide-scale system infiltration.             | High         |
| 0002      | Build Environment | Compromise of build process (e.g., tampering with build scripts) | Attackers who gain access to the build server or scripts can introduce backdoors in images    | Possibly enforced by a minimal set of permissions on build server                                           | Use ephemeral build agents, sign final artifacts, and monitor integrity of the build environment.                                                      | Low if access to the build environment is strongly controlled                                              | Backdoored images could be deployed, giving attackers direct access to production.                       | High         |
| 0003      | Container Registry | Pushing of unauthorized or tampered images                       | Malicious user could overwrite legitimate images with compromised versions                     | Registry access presumably limited to CI with credentials only                                              | Use multi-factor authentication for registry admins, read-only access for most, and define separate write permissions for the build pipeline.          | Medium if credentials get leaked or misused                                                                | If successful, the malicious image would be deployed, compromising the entire system and data.            | High         |

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
1. **Questions**
   - Are there documented procedures for rotating API keys for Meal Planner applications?
   - Are there additional controls in place for elevated administrator access (MFA, IP allowlists)?
   - What is the exact CI/CD process for building and deploying Docker images?
   - Are container images scanned for vulnerabilities before being pushed to production?

2. **Assumptions**
   - All data flows that cross external boundaries are protected by TLS.
   - The system enforces unique API keys and ACL rules at the API Gateway.
   - The ChatGPT communication is performed only over secure channels with server certificate validation.
   - Access to AWS environment (IAM roles, security groups) follows the principle of least privilege.

These threat models focus on risks introduced by the AI Nutrition-Pro architecture as described. Potential mitigations and control references are based on information available in the document and typical usage patterns of AWS ECS, Kong API Gateway, and Golang-based microservices.
