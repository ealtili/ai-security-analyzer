# Project Design Document: Screenshot-to-Code

## BUSINESS POSTURE

Screenshot-to-Code is a tool that takes a screenshot as input and generates corresponding HTML/CSS code, effectively reverse engineering web pages from their visual appearance. This project addresses several business priorities:

1. Accelerating UI Development: Converting design mockups to functional code quickly, reducing the time between design and implementation.
2. Design-to-Code Automation: Eliminating manual coding of visual elements, reducing human error and inconsistency.
3. Accessibility for Non-Developers: Allowing designers and product managers to generate code without deep technical expertise.
4. Educational Tool: Helping beginners learn web development by seeing how UIs translate to code.

Key business risks include:
1. Quality and Accuracy: The fidelity and performance of generated code directly impacts user trust and adoption.
2. API Dependency: Heavy reliance on OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API creates dependency risk.
3. Cost Management: API costs could scale unexpectedly with increased usage.
4. Competitive Landscape: Similar tools may emerge, requiring continuous innovation to maintain relevance.
5. Technical Debt: Rapid development may lead to architectural decisions that limit future scale or features.

## SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls and accepted risks:

- Security control: API key authentication for OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API access, implemented via environment variables in the deployment platform.
- Security control: Client-side validation of image uploads to ensure proper format and prevent malicious file uploads.
- Security control: Using Next.js's built-in security features including automatic input sanitization.
- Security control: Deployment on Vercel platform providing TLS/SSL encryption for all communications.
- Accepted risk: Generated code quality and security are dependent on GPT-4 Vision's capabilities.
- Accepted risk: No user authentication system, making it difficult to implement personalized rate limiting or tracking.
- Accepted risk: Limited server-side validation for inputs.

Recommended high-priority security controls:

1. Implement comprehensive server-side validation for all user inputs.
2. Add Content Security Policy headers to prevent XSS attacks.
3. Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse and manage costs.
4. Establish a vulnerability management process for dependencies.
5. Add telemetry and logging for security-relevant events.
6. Implement user authentication for personalized experiences and better security controls.

Security requirements:

Authentication:
- Consider implementing user authentication to associate generated content with specific users.
- If implementing authentication, use industry standard protocols like OAuth 2.0 or OIDC.
- Store authentication tokens securely with proper expiration policies.

Authorization:
- Implement role-based access control if adding multi-user capabilities.
- Ensure users can only access their own generated code and uploaded screenshots.
- Apply rate limiting per user or IP address to prevent abuse.

Input Validation:
- Validate all user inputs both client-side and server-side.
- Implement strict file validation for uploaded screenshots (type, size, dimensions).
- Sanitize generated code before rendering to prevent XSS attacks.

Cryptography:
- Ensure all API communications use TLS 1.2+ with strong cipher suites.
- Store API keys in secure environment variables, never in client-side code.
- Consider implementing encryption for stored user data if persistence is added.

## DESIGN

The Screenshot-to-Code application follows a modern web application architecture, designed to be simple yet effective for its specific use case.

### DEPLOYMENT

The Screenshot-to-Code application can be deployed in several ways:

1. Vercel Deployment (Primary): Leveraging Next.js native integration with Vercel for serverless deployment.
2. Traditional Web Hosting: Deploying to traditional web servers after building the Next.js application.
3. Self-Hosted: Organizations can deploy on-premises for greater control.

We'll focus on the primary Vercel deployment model:

3. Environment variable protection for API keys and secrets
4. Automated testing to verify functionality
5. Controlled deployment process through Vercel

## RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes to protect:

1. Screenshot Processing: The core functionality of analyzing uploaded screenshots
2. Code Generation: The accuracy and quality of the generated HTML/CSS
3. User Experience: The responsiveness and reliability of the application
4. API Integration: The secure and cost-effective use of the OpenAI API

Data to protect and sensitivity:

1. User-Uploaded Screenshots (Medium Sensitivity):
   - May contain proprietary design information
   - Could potentially include sensitive information if users upload screenshots containing confidential data
   - Temporary storage only during processing

2. Generated Code (Medium Sensitivity):
   - Represents intellectual property derived from user inputs
   - May reveal information about proprietary designs or implementations
   - Currently not persistently stored on server

3. OpenAI API Credentials (High Sensitivity):
   - Access credentials to paid third-party services
   - Unauthorized use could result in financial impact
   - Protected via environment variables

4. User Session Data (Low Sensitivity):
   - Basic usage information
   - No personal identifiable information currently collected
   - Used only for current session functionality
