# Project Design Document: Screenshot-to-Code

## BUSINESS POSTURE

Screenshot-to-Code is an innovative tool designed to convert design screenshots into functional code. The project aims to accelerate the development process for frontend engineers and designers by using AI to translate visual designs into implementation-ready code.

### Business Priorities and Goals:
1. Simplify and accelerate the UI development process
2. Bridge the gap between design and implementation
3. Provide a zero-installation web tool accessible to anyone
4. Support multiple frontend frameworks (HTML/CSS, Tailwind, React, Vue)
5. Build an open-source community around AI-powered development tools

### Business Risks:
1. Dependency on third-party AI services (particularly OpenAI), creating potential availability and cost concerns
2. Accuracy limitations in code generation may affect user satisfaction and adoption
3. Scaling challenges as the service grows in popularity
4. Competition from similar tools or integrated features in design platforms
5. Managing the cost of AI API usage while maintaining the service's accessibility

## SECURITY POSTURE

### Existing Security Controls and Accepted Risks:

- Security control: Environment variable management for sensitive API keys, implemented through Next.js environment configuration
- Security control: Client-side processing of screenshots reducing data transfer risk, implemented in the frontend code
- Security control: Third-party authentication for the hosted version, implemented through Vercel deployment
- Security control: Input validation for image uploads, implemented in the frontend code
- Security control: Rate limiting through OpenAI API proxy, implemented in the backend code

- Accepted risk: Reliance on third-party AI providers (OpenAI) for critical functionality
- Accepted risk: Potential exposure of user designs through screenshot uploads
- Accepted risk: Limited logging and audit capabilities in the current implementation
- Accepted risk: No encryption for screenshots during local processing
- Accepted risk: Limited protection against prompt injection attacks

### Recommended Security Controls:

1. Implementation of Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks
2. Comprehensive input validation for screenshots to prevent malicious uploads
3. Secure storage and rotation of API keys
4. Enhanced rate limiting and abuse prevention mechanisms
5. Implementation of audit logging for operations
6. Regular dependency scanning and updates
7. Sandboxed execution of generated code preview

### Security Requirements:

#### Authentication
- Implement strong authentication for API access
- Consider optional user accounts for the web interface with secure credential management
- Employ secure token handling for session management

#### Authorization
- Restrict access to API endpoints based on user roles/permissions
- Implement resource-based access controls for saved projects
- Enforce usage limits based on user tiers

#### Input Validation
- Validate all screenshot uploads for size, format, and content
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Implement secure file handling practices

#### Cryptography
- Encrypt API keys at rest and in transit
- Consider encrypting saved screenshots if implementing persistence
- Use secure, modern TLS configurations for all communications

### DEPLOYMENT

The Screenshot-to-Code project can be deployed in several ways:

1. Self-hosted web application
2. Locally installed CLI tool
3. Vercel-hosted web application (current primary deployment)

We'll focus on the Vercel-hosted deployment as this is the primary method used by the project.

### BUILD

The Screenshot-to-Code project uses GitHub and Vercel for its build and deployment processes.

```mermaid

    Developer[Developer] -->|Commits code| LocalRepo[Local Git Repository]
    LocalRepo -->|Push changes| GitHub[GitHub Repository]
    GitHub -->|Trigger| GithubActions[GitHub Actions]
    GitHub -->|Trigger| VercelDeploy[Vercel Deployment]

    GithubActions -->|Run tests| Testing[Testing]
    GithubActions -->|Run linting| Linting[Linting]

    Testing -->|Results| BuildResults[Build Results]
    Linting -->|Results| BuildResults

    VercelDeploy -->|Install dependencies| NPMInstall[NPM Install]
    NPMInstall -->|Build application| NextBuild[Next.js Build]
    NextBuild -->|Deploy| VercelHosting[Vercel Hosting]

    VercelHosting -->|Publish| ProductionApp[Production Application]

    subgraph "CI/CD Pipeline"
        GithubActions
        VercelDeploy
        Testing
        Linting
        NPMInstall
        NextBuild
    end
```

The build process for Screenshot-to-Code follows these steps:

1. Developers work locally and commit code to the GitHub repository
2. GitHub Actions runs tests and linting checks
3. Vercel's deployment process installs dependencies via NPM
4. Next.js builds the application
5. The built application is deployed to Vercel's hosting platform

Security controls in the build process include:
- Dependency integrity verification through package lock files
- Automated testing to catch issues before deployment
- Linting to enforce code quality standards
- Environment variable management for API keys and secrets
- Vercel's built-in security controls for deployment

The project could benefit from additional build-time security controls:
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing) scanning
- Secret scanning to prevent accidental credential exposure
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container scanning if containerization is implemented in the future

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Critical Business Processes to Protect:
1. Screenshot processing and code generation
2. User interaction with the web interface
3. API communication with OpenAI
4. CLI tool functionality and security
5. Deployment and release processes

### Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

| Data Type | Sensitivity | Reason |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| User Screenshots | Medium | May contain proprietary designs or sensitive information |
| OpenAI API Keys | High | Could be used to rack up charges if exposed |
| Generated Code | Medium | Represents intellectual property of users |
| User Preferences | Low | Limited personal information, but still requires protection |
| System Configuration | Medium | Could expose system details useful for attackers |

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

### BUSINESS POSTURE
1. Is this tool intended for commercial use or primarily as an open-source community project?
   - Assumption: It's an open-source project with potential for commercial applications or services built on top.
2. What is the target scale for this service?
   - Assumption: Initially targeted at individual developers and small teams, with potential to scale.
3. What is the business model for sustaining API costs?
   - Assumption: Currently relies on users providing their own API keys, may evolve to a freemium model.

### SECURITY POSTURE
1. What level of data protection is required for user uploads?
   - Assumption: Standard web application security practices are sufficient, with no long-term storage of screenshots.
2. Are there compliance requirements for the project?
   - Assumption: No specific regulatory compliance requirements beyond standard security practices.
3. What is the threat model for potential attackers?
   - Assumption: Primary concerns are API key theft, prompt injection, and potential exposure of proprietary designs.

### DESIGN
