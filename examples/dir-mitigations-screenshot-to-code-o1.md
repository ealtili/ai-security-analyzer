## Mitigation Strategies

Below are mitigation strategies specifically tailored to the unique threats present in the “screenshot-to-code” application as described in the PROJECT FILES. Each strategy focuses on risks introduced by this particular codebase and omits general, common best practices.

---

### 1. Validate and Restrict Screenshot URLs (Prevent SSRF)

- **Mitigation Strategy**
  Implement server-side filtering of user-provided URLs in the “/api/screenshot” route to block access to internal or private network addresses.

- **Description**
  1. On receiving a user-submitted URL, parse and check its hostname/IP.
  2. Reject or sanitize any request targeting internal IP ranges (e.g., 127.0.0.1, 169.254.x.x, RFC1918 private networks).
  3. Optionally use a DNS resolution step to ensure the requested domain is external and not a loopback.
  4. Maintain an allowlist or blocklist if necessary for known safe or unsafe addresses.

- **List of Threats Mitigated**
  - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High severity): Attackers could force the backend to perform unauthorized requests to internal services.

- **Impact**
  - Significantly reduces the risk of SSRF attacks that could compromise internal infrastructure or access sensitive internal endpoints.

- **Currently Implemented**
  - None (the code calls ScreenshotOne’s API directly with user-submitted URLs without validation).

- **Missing Implementation**
  - Entire logic for validating external URLs before making screenshot requests.

### 2. Sanitize AI-Generated Code to Prevent XSS

- **Mitigation Strategy**
  Before displaying or embedding code returned by LLMs (Claude, GPT, etc.) in the front end, strip or neutralize any malicious scripts or HTML that could cause cross-site scripting in the user’s browser.

- **Description**
  1. Use a robust HTML sanitization library in the frontend (e.g., DOMPurify or a React HTML sanitizer) when rendering code blocks.
  2. Render AI-generated code as text or within an isolated sandbox/IFrame that does not have access to the parent DOM.
  3. For “live preview” functionality, ensure the preview is either sandboxed or served from a different domain to prevent arbitrary script execution.

- **List of Threats Mitigated**
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High severity): Attackers could hijack user sessions or carry out malicious operations by injecting scripts.

- **Impact**
  - Greatly reduces the likelihood of XSS exploits by default. Without sanitization, any 3rd party or malicious prompt could produce harmful HTML/JS.

- **Currently Implemented**
  - None (the code extracts <html> tags but does not sanitize the contents before returning them to the front end).

- **Missing Implementation**
  - Proper sanitization or “safe rendering” for AI-generated HTML in the frontend.

### 3. Limit Debug Logging of Sensitive Data

- **Mitigation Strategy**
  Mask or omit environment variables, API keys, and user inputs from verbose debug logs to prevent accidental exposure in logs or version control.

- **Description**
  1. When logging prompts or responses with “IS_DEBUG_ENABLED,” exclude or redact secrets from output.
  2. Restrict logs to minimal relevant data, e.g., error messages or short event traces only.
  3. Confirm that environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) are never directly logged.

- **List of Threats Mitigated**
  - Information Disclosure (Medium severity): Exposing secrets or sensitive user data in logs can lead to unauthorized key usage.

- **Impact**
  - Ensures that accidental leak of API credentials or user-provided data is minimized, preventing a major pivot point for attackers.

- **Currently Implemented**
  - Partial: The code logs all prompt messages if “IS_DEBUG_ENABLED” is set but does not appear to mask secrets.

- **Missing Implementation**
  - Redaction logic for sensitive fields in logs and thorough checks to ensure no secrets are printed to console or stored on disk.

### 4. Validate Custom AI Endpoint URLs

- **Mitigation Strategy**
  Only allow certain trusted domain patterns for OPENAI_BASE_URL or Anthropic Base URL to prevent malicious re-routing or SSRF.

- **Description**
  1. Maintain an allowlist of official endpoints (e.g., *.openai.com, *.anthropic.com).
  2. If a custom base URL is absolutely necessary, perform a DNS lookup to ensure it does not resolve to internal IPs, similarly to SSRF checks.
  3. Reject or fail gracefully if the domain is unrecognized or points to a private network address.

- **List of Threats Mitigated**
  - SSRF (Medium severity): Attackers could re-route requests to hidden or internal services.
  - Credential Leakage (Medium severity): Could inadvertently send secrets to an untrusted domain.

- **Impact**
  - Substantially reduces the risk of malicious or rogue endpoints capturing or misusing requests and environment credentials.

- **Currently Implemented**
  - None: The code allows environment variable override for the OpenAI base URL, with no domain check.

- **Missing Implementation**
  - Domain/URL validation mechanism in the environment variable reading logic.

### 5. Enforce File Size Limits on Images and Videos

- **Mitigation Strategy**
  Restrict maximum allowed file size for images/screenshots/videos the user can submit, to prevent resource exhaustion or denial-of-service conditions (e.g., by uploading extremely large files).

- **Description**
  1. Add a maximum file size check when receiving data URLs or file uploads in the “/generate-code” or video processing routes.
  2. If a file exceeds the limit, reject the request and return an appropriate error.
  3. Implement early checks (e.g., reading Content-Length headers or partial data to detect large files).

- **List of Threats Mitigated**
  - Denial of Service via large file processing (Medium severity).
  - Excessive resource usage leading to server instability (Medium severity).

- **Impact**
  - Significantly reduces the risk that an attacker can crash or slow the application by sending massive inputs.

- **Currently Implemented**
  - None: The screenshot or video input simply iterates frames (MoviePy) with no mention of input size constraints.

- **Missing Implementation**
  - File size check before reading the entire data into memory or submitting to the AI APIs.

### 6. Store Environment Keys Securely and Exclude .env from Commits

- **Mitigation Strategy**
  Ensure environment variables containing API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Replicate, etc.) are never pushed to public repository and are handled via secrets management.

- **Description**
  1. Use a secrets manager (like Vault or GitHub Actions secrets) or container orchestration secrets to pass keys into containers.
  2. Confirm .env is in .gitignore and that local dev instructions do not accidentally commit real credentials.
  3. Rotate credentials regularly to mitigate risk if a key is leaked.

- **List of Threats Mitigated**
  - Credential Leakage (High severity): Direct commits of secrets can allow immediate unauthorized usage.
  - Lateral Movement (Medium severity): Attackers reusing these keys for further compromise.

- **Impact**
  - Very high reduction in risk of code leaks containing real production secrets, preventing a broad range of attacks.

- **Currently Implemented**
  - Some mention of “.env” usage in documentation, but no built-in secrets manager approach. .env is presumably .gitignored, but it depends on local developer adherence.

- **Missing Implementation**
  - Verified secrets manager or environment-based approach that disallows accidental commit.
  - Automatic rotation or forced reissuance of keys.

### 7. Sandbox or Containerize Generated Code Execution (Future Feature)

- **Mitigation Strategy**
  If the application ever moves toward executing or previewing the generated code on the server side, run it in a hardened sandbox or ephemeral container with minimal privileges.

- **Description**
  1. Use a container or VM that isolates the environment from the host.
  2. Drop all unnecessary capabilities and apply seccomp/apparmor profiles.
  3. Automatically discard the container after execution to ensure no persistent side effects.

- **List of Threats Mitigated**
  - Remote Code Execution (High severity): If the AI output is run server-side, an attacker might craft malicious code.
  - Privilege Escalation (Medium severity): Minimizes damage if malicious code tries to break out of the environment.

- **Impact**
  - Practically eliminates persistent infiltration from malicious code by confining any processes to a short-lived, permissions-limited environment.

- **Currently Implemented**
  - Not applicable yet (the code is not executing user-generated code server-side). Docker is used for deployment, but not for dynamic code sandboxing.

- **Missing Implementation**
  - Automated ephemeral container or sandbox if the product evolves to server-based code previews or builds.

These mitigation strategies directly address the key risks introduced by the application’s unique features—particularly SSRF through screenshot endpoints, potential XSS from AI-generated code, large file ingestion, and insecure handling of environment-based secrets. By implementing these measures, “screenshot-to-code” can significantly reduce its attack surface and maintain a safer development and production environment.
