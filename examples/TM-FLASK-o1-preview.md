Predictable tokens enable attackers to hijack user sessions.                                  | Uses `SecureCookieSessionInterface` with cryptographic signing via `itsdangerous`.                                           | Ensure strong, random secret keys are used for signing. Encourage key rotation and provide key management documentation.                             | Medium likelihood if developers use weak secrets or default configurations.                                                                        | High impact as attackers can impersonate users and access sensitive data or functionalities.                                                      | High          |

Provide input validation utilities and educate developers on secure templating practices.                  | High likelihood since developers may disable autoescaping or improperly handle user input.                                                        | High impact as XSS can lead to session theft, defacement, or data exfiltration from users.                                                         | Critical      |

Offer tools to automatically validate and sanitize JSON input.                                            | Medium likelihood due to potential lack of input validation by developers.                                                                         | Medium impact as it may allow unauthorized actions or data manipulation.                                                                          | Medium        |

Update documentation to highlight secure session management practices.               | High likelihood if developers are unaware of the need for session ID regeneration.                                                                 | High impact as attackers gain unauthorized access to user accounts and data.                                                                     | High          |

Implement warnings or errors when unsafe paths are used. Educate developers on proper usage.                   | Low likelihood given existing safeguards, but increases if developers bypass or ignore warnings.                                                    | Medium impact due to potential exposure of server files and sensitive information.                                                                | Medium        |
| 0006      | Flask Core        | Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion with Malicious Requests          | Denial of Service      | Attackers can overwhelm the application by sending excessive or large requests, depleting resources and causing service disruption.  | No built-in rate limiting or request size restrictions by default in Flask Core.                                             | Introduce default request size limits and optional rate-limiting features. Recommend deployment configurations that mitigate DoS attacks.          | Medium likelihood since the framework lacks inherent protections; mitigations depend on deployment and application-level controls.                 | High impact as legitimate users may be unable to access services during an attack.                                                                 | High          |

Provide configuration examples. Deprecate support for unencrypted connections.     | Medium likelihood if developers misconfigure SSL/TLS or neglect to secure communications.                                                         | Critical impact as attackers can steal sensitive data or credentials and manipulate content.                                                      | Critical      |

Provide concurrency control mechanisms within the framework.                               | High likelihood due to complexity and potential lack of developer experience with async programming.                                               | Medium impact as data integrity issues can affect application reliability and security.                                                           | Medium        |
| 0009      | Configuration     | Information Disclosure by Leaving Debug Mode Enabled in Production                   | Information Disclosure | Debug mode displays detailed error pages that can reveal sensitive information about the application and environment.               | The framework allows debug mode to be enabled without restrictions; relies on developers to disable it in production.         | Modify the framework to detect production environments and automatically disable debug mode. Issue warnings when debug is enabled in production.  | Medium likelihood as developers may forget to disable debug mode, especially during rapid deployment cycles.                                       | High impact as exposed information can aid attackers in exploiting other vulnerabilities.                                                         | High          |
| 0010      | Blueprints        | Unauthorized Access Through Misconfigured Route Registrations                        | Elevation of Privilege | Incorrectly configured blueprints can expose endpoints without proper authentication or authorization checks.                       | Blueprints provide organizational structure but do not enforce access controls; developers must implement security measures.  | Introduce default access control mechanisms or middleware. Offer secure blueprint templates and thorough documentation on secure configurations.   | Medium likelihood due to possible misconfigurations in complex or large-scale applications.                                                       | High impact as attackers could access or manipulate restricted resources.                                                                         | High          |

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

**Questions:**

1. Are there plans to implement default Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection within the Flask framework to assist developers?
2. Does the framework provide guidance or tools for secure session management practices, such as session ID regeneration and setting secure cookie attributes?
3. Has the documentation been updated to include best practices for secure asynchronous programming within Flask applications?
4. Are there built-in utilities or officially recommended extensions for input validation and sanitization to prevent vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection?
5. Can the framework enforce secure default configurations, such as disabling debug mode in production environments and requiring HTTPS connections?

**Assumptions:**

- Developers may not be fully aware of certain security best practices unless the framework provides explicit guidance or default implementations.
- The Flask framework relies on developers to implement critical security controls, which may lead to vulnerabilities if not properly addressed.
- Existing security controls within the framework are robust but may require enhancements or better documentation to mitigate emerging threats effectively.
- The integration of context locals and global proxies is handled securely within the framework to prevent data leakage between requests.
- Helper functions for serving files are designed to prevent directory traversal attacks, assuming developers use them as intended without modification.
