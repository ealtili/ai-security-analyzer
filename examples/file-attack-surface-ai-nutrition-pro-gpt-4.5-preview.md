## Attack Surface Analysis for AI Nutrition-Pro Application:

### 1. Exposure to Prompt Injection Attacks through ChatGPT Integration
- **Description:** Prompt injection attacks occur when an attacker crafts malicious inputs designed specifically to manipulate ChatGPT's responses. Since AI Nutrition-Pro integrates directly with ChatGPT, malicious content injected as "dietitian samples" or requests could exploit vulnerabilities in prompt handling.
- **Contribution:** AI Nutrition-Pro directly interacts with ChatGPT through external API calls and accepts user-provided or user-influenced data as input for LLM processing.
- **Example:** A Meal Planner application uploads deliberately misleading or manipulative samples, inducing incorrect or inappropriate generated content from ChatGPT.
- **Impact:** Malicious content generation, reputational damage, inappropriate or harmful suggestions provided to end users.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Current Mitigations:** The existing architecture has input filtering via the API Gateway and HTTPS/TLS protection for data in transit. However, these measures alone do not comprehensively mitigate prompt injection risks.
- **Missing Mitigations:** Implementing strict input validation designed specifically to detect and sanitize inputs targeting LLM systems. Applying moderation or filtering on LLM-generated outputs. Introducing systems or automated content checks for unusual or sensitive generated results.

### 2. Security Risks Related to API Gateway and Meal Planner Access
- **Description:** Unauthorized access or abuse due to compromised or leaked API keys allowing attackers to misuse the API or conduct enumeration of potential user data.
- **Contribution:** AI Nutrition-Pro provides API keys for Meal Planner Applications for authentication and authorization.
- **Example:** A leaked or stolen API key from one of the Meal Planner applications leads an attacker to use excessive resources, violate rate limits, or retrieve unauthorized data.
- **Impact:** Potential data breach, misconfiguration, service disruption, unauthorized content generation, and billing fraud.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Current Mitigations:** API Gateway integrates built-in access control, API key authentication, rate limiting, and filtering of input through Kong. Mitigations reduce but do not entirely eliminate the severity of an exploitable API key compromise.
- **Missing Mitigations:** Enhance security through rotation policy of API keys, IP-based ACLs or whitelists, active monitoring of API key usage patterns indicating misuse or abnormal behavior, and implementation of API throttling mechanisms aligned with expected usage patterns.

### 3. Data Storage Risks in API and Control Plane Database Instances
- **Description:** Sensitive data (dietitian-created content samples, requests, responses, billing and tenant details) stored in the Control Plane and API databases could be compromised if storage is improperly configured, sensitive details remain unencrypted at rest, or if credential leaks occur.
- **Contribution:** AI Nutrition-Pro's use of AWS RDS stores sensitive operational and customer data.
- **Example:** Misconfigured database permissions enable unauthorized internal users to gain access to sensitive tenant billing details and stored dietitian-generated content.
- **Impact:** Leakage of confidential information, regulatory compliance violations, significant reputational damage, and potential legal or financial penalties.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Current Mitigations:** Currently secured infrastructure through Amazon RDS together with enforced TLS encryption ensures secure network communications. However, loss or compromise of credentials or encryption keys remains a risk.
- **Missing Mitigations:** Ensure encryption-at-rest for all sensitive fields/data and secure key management practices (e.g., AWS KMS), rigorous implementation of principle of least privilege, and utilize AWS IAM Policy controls extensively to restrict database access strictly to authorized components/users.

### 4. Risks of Compromise or Misconfiguration of Web Control Plane
- **Description:** Compromise of the Control Plane application (used for client onboarding, management, configuration, billing) might cause unauthorized client access, billing manipulation, or system-wide administrative misuse.
- **Contribution:** AI Nutrition-Pro has a critical control-plane component exposed to admin users.
- **Example:** The administrator workspace is compromised due to inadequate authentication mechanisms or vulnerabilities in web control interface, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive configuration data or billing information.
- **Impact:** System-wide disruption, unauthorized billing changes, data leakage, regulatory noncompliance.
- **Risk Severity:** Medium
- **Current Mitigations:** Application is hosted on AWS ECS, benefiting from AWS infrastructure security. Restricted administrator access and network encryption minimizes risk.
- **Missing Mitigations:** Implement strong multi-factor authentication mechanisms; enforce stringent web control-plane access limits; isolate administrator functionality from other application access patterns; integrate role-based access control (RBAC) explicitly restricting administrator actions by roles.

### 5. Risk of Malicious or Exploitative Inputs from Meal Planner Applications
- **Description:** Inputs originating from external Meal Planner applications may be crafted maliciously or irresponsibly, affecting integrity or quality of generated outputs or consuming excessive system resources.
- **Contribution:** Meal Planner applications provide samples of dietitians' content and request generation via the API, potentially crafting malicious or abusive input.
- **Example:** A malicious actor using a meal planner application continually sends complex or maliciously designed inputs to API endpoints, causing resource exhaustion or degradation of service quality, impacting legitimate customers.
- **Impact:** Service degradation or resource exhaustion, poor-quality outputs, potentially harming legitimate customer experience.
- **Risk Severity:** Medium
- **Current Mitigations:** Existing network encryption (TLS), input filtering, authentication, rate limiting, and ACL are in place, thereby partially mitigating impacts.
- **Missing Mitigations:** Improve the granularity and context-awareness of input validation at the API Gateway level; introduce stricter rate limiting controls; implement resource monitoring; detect unusual patterns; add robust automated input moderation/screening to flag suspicious submissions before forwarding requests to backend AI processing.

### 6. Dependency on External LLM Service Provider (ChatGPT/OpenAI)
- **Description:** The application extensively depends on OpenAI's external ChatGPT API. Significant availability, latency, rate-limit changes or internal provider attacks negatively impact reliability and availability of AI Nutrition-Pro.
- **Contribution:** Direct integration with third-party LLM vendor (OpenAI's ChatGPT) for essential content generation functionalities.
- **Example:** A distributed denial-of-service attack or operational downtime affecting OpenAI significantly reduces AI Nutrition-Pro usability.
- **Impact:** Downtime or degraded performance to customers, potential business continuity disruption, loss of customer trust.
- **Risk Severity:** Medium
- **Current Mitigations:** There are no indicated mitigations for third-party dependencies within the current described architecture.
- **Missing Mitigations:** Establish alternate fallback providers for LLM services to ensure business continuity; clearly communicate SLA limitations to users; implement rate limiting and proper error handling logic to gracefully manage any OpenAI outages or interruptions; performance monitoring to catch and quickly manage downstream system issues.

**Note:** All proposed missing mitigations help reduce the presented risks significantly when implemented effectively. It's critical to consistently evaluate these suggestions in the context of the overall threat model and business priorities over the application lifecycle.
