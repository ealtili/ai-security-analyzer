# AI Nutrition-Pro System Design Document

## BUSINESS POSTURE
The AI Nutrition-Pro system aims to provide dietitians with AI-generated content creation capabilities through secure API integrations with existing meal planning applications. Key business priorities include enabling seamless integration for third-party meal planning tools, maintaining high availability for API consumers, and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations (HIPAA for US customers, GDPR for EU markets)[1][2].

Primary business risks requiring mitigation:
1. Dependency on third-party LLM providers creating vendor lock-in and potential service disruptions
2. Unauthorized access to proprietary dietitian content samples compromising competitive advantage
3. Regulatory non-compliance leading to financial penalties and reputational damage

## SECURITY POSTURE
**Existing Security Controls:**
- security control: API key authentication for Meal Planner applications via Kong API Gateway[3]
- security control: TLS 1.3 encryption for all external communications[4]
- security control: Rate limiting at API Gateway layer (1000 requests/minute per client)[5]
- security control: Input validation filters for SQLi and XSS patterns in API payloads[6]

**Accepted Risks:**
- accepted risk: Third-party LLM dependency with contractual SLAs but no direct security control over ChatGPT-3.5 outputs
- accepted risk: Encrypted data at rest in RDS using AWS default encryption rather than customer-managed keys

**Recommended Security Controls:**
1. Implementation of multi-factor authentication for administrator access to Web Control Plane
2. Regular third-party penetration testing of API endpoints (quarterly schedule)
3. Data loss prevention (DLP) scanning for sensitive content in LLM training datasets

**Security Requirements:**
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow for machine-to-machine authentication
- Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) with tenant isolation in database layer
- Input Validation: Strict schema validation for all API requests with max payload size of 1MB
- Cryptography: AES-256-GCM for sensitive data fields with quarterly key rotation

**Build Security Controls:**
1. Supply Chain:
   - Signed commits requiring GPG verification
   - Dependency scanning via OWASP Dependency-Check
   - Provenance attestation for container images

2. Automation:
   - SAST scanning with Semgrep and CodeQL
   - SCA analysis using Renovate Bot
   - Container vulnerability scanning with Trivy

3. Artifact Security:
   - Immutable container tags in ECR
   - SBOM generation for each release
   - Notary v2 signatures for all artifacts

## RISK ASSESSMENT
**Critical Business Processes:**
1. Client onboarding workflow handling sensitive organizational data
2. LLM content generation maintaining dietitian-specific voice profiles
3. Billing reconciliation processes involving payment data

**Protected Data Assets:**
| Data Type | Sensitivity | Protection Measures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tenant API Keys | High | - KMS encryption <br> - Key rotation every 90 days |
| LLM Training Data | Medium | - Anonymization <br> - Access logging |
| Billing Records | High | - PCI DSS compliance <br> - Tokenization |
| Audit Logs | Medium | - Immutable storage <br> - SIEM integration |

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
**Outstanding Questions:**
1. Multi-tenancy Implementation:
   - Is tenant isolation implemented at application layer or database layer?
   - Default assumption: Schema-based isolation in PostgreSQL

2. Incident Response:
   - What SLA exists for security incident response?
   - Default assumption: 1-hour response time for P1 incidents

3. Compliance Scope:
   - Which specific GDPR/HIPAA articles require implementation?
   - Default assumption: Article 32 (Security of processing) and HIPAA ยง164.312

**Architectural Assumptions:**
1. All internal service communication uses mutual TLS authentication
2. API Gateway performs request validation against OpenAPI specifications
3. Database credentials are rotated automatically using IAM roles
4. LLM outputs undergo content moderation filtering before delivery
