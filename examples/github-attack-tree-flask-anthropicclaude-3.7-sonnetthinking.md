# Threat Modeling Analysis for Flask using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

Project: Flask (https://github.com/pallets/flask)

### Overview
Flask is a lightweight Python web microframework based on Werkzeug, Jinja2, and good intentions. It's designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. Flask provides a minimalistic core with essential components while allowing extensive customization through extensions.

### Key Components and Features
- **Routing System**: Maps URLs to view functions
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 for rendering HTML
- **Request/Response Objects**: Handles HTTP interactions
- **Session Management**: Provides client-side (cookie-based) sessions
- **Blueprints**: Modular application components
- **Application & Request Contexts**: Manages global state
- **Development Server**: Built-in server for testing
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tools for Flask applications

### Dependencies
- **Werkzeug**: WSGI toolkit providing request/response objects
- **Jinja2**: Template engine
- **ItsDangerous**: Data signing library (for secure cookies)
- **Click**: Command-line interface creation kit
- **MarkupSafe**: String handling for safe HTML

## 7. High-Risk Attack Paths Analysis

### Critical Risk Paths

#### 1. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact**: Critical
- **Justification**: Flask uses Jinja2 for templating, which can execute Python code within templates. If user input is directly incorporated into template strings (especially using `render_template_string()`), attackers can inject template expressions that execute arbitrary code. This is particularly dangerous in Flask because the application context provides access to powerful Python features and framework internals.

#### 2. Debug Mode Exposures
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: Critical
- **Justification**: Flask's debug mode enables the Werkzeug interactive debugger which explicitly provides a Python console for debugging. If accidentally enabled in production (a common mistake), this provides direct code execution capability to anyone who can trigger an error.

#### 3. Weak Secret Keys
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact**: High
- **Justification**: Flask uses a SECRET_KEY for signing cookies and sessions. Many Flask applications use hardcoded, predictable, or insufficiently random keys. Since Flask stores session data client-side by default, a compromised key allows attackers to forge valid session cookies and impersonate users.

#### 4. Flask-Admin with Weak Controls
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: Critical
- **Justification**: Flask-Admin is a popular extension that provides administrative interfaces to application data. If improperly secured, it can grant attackers complete control over application data with minimal technical barriers.

## 8. Critical Security Controls

| Attack Vector | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|
| **Template Injection (SSTI)** | • Never use `render_template_string()` with user input<br>• Use `render_template()` with separate template files<br>• Sanitize all input passed to templates<br>• Apply principle of least privilege to template context<br>• Consider a sandboxed Jinja2 environment |
| **Debug Mode** | • Enforce `debug=False` in production<br>• Use environment variables for configuration<br>• Implement deployment checks that verify production settings<br>• Use separate config files for different environments |
| **Secret Key Management** | • Generate strong random SECRET_KEY (e.g., `os.urandom(24).hex()`)<br>• Store keys in environment variables, not code<br>• Use different keys for development/production<br>• Rotate keys periodically<br>• Consider using a key management service |
| **Session Security** | • Set Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite cookie flags<br>• Use server-side sessions for sensitive applications<br>• Regenerate session IDs after authentication<br>• Implement proper session timeout<br>• Add secondary validation for sessions |
| **XSS Prevention** | • Rely on Jinja2's automatic escaping<br>• Avoid using `|safe` filter on untrusted content<br>• Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers<br>• Use Flask-Talisman to enforce secure headers |
| **Extension Security** | • Audit Flask extensions for security implications<br>• Apply extension-specific security best practices<br>• Use a reduced set of extensions in production<br>• Monitor extension security advisories |
| **Request Handling** | • Validate all request parameters<br>• Set appropriate request size limits<br>• Handle content-type parsing errors gracefully<br>• Implement proper error handling for malformed requests |

## 9. Summary of Findings

### Key Risks Identified

1. **Template Injection Vulnerabilities**: Flask's Jinja2 template engine can be exploited for remote code execution if user input is improperly handled in templates.

2. **Insecure Default Configurations**: Several Flask settings, particularly debug mode and SECRET_KEY, can dramatically weaken security if improperly configured.

3. **Client-Side Session Storage**: Flask's default cookie-based sessions create risks if the secret key is compromised or proper cookie flags aren't set.

4. **Extension Security Issues**: Many Flask applications rely on extensions that introduce additional attack vectors if not properly secured.

5. **Template-Based XSS**: While Flask provides auto-escaping in templates, developers often bypass this protection using unsafe filters or functions.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Secure Template Handling**:
   - Never use user input in dynamic template strings
   - Maintain strict separation between code and data in templates
   - Use context-specific escaping for all user data

2. **Configuration Hardening**:
   - Implement environment-specific configuration management
   - Generate strong, unique SECRET_KEYs and store them securely
   - Enforce production checks that prevent debug mode in live environments

3. **Session Security Enhancement**:
   - Consider server-side session storage for sensitive applications
   - Set secure cookie flags by default
   - Implement proper session lifecycle management

4. **Careful Extension Selection and Configuration**:
   - Apply security best practices specific to each extension
   - Regularly update extensions and monitor security advisories
   - Implement defense-in-depth around extension functionality

5. **Request Validation Framework**:
   - Establish consistent input validation patterns
   - Set appropriate limits on request sizes and content types
   - Implement proper error handling for malformed requests

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

### Questions:
1. What specific Flask version is being used? Security features have improved in newer versions.
2. Which Flask extensions are being used? Many vulnerabilities stem from extension implementations.
3. How is the application being deployed? Different WSGI servers and deployment methods have security implications.
4. Is the application handling sensitive data or authentication? This affects the impact of session/cookie vulnerabilities.

### Assumptions:
1. The Flask application follows typical usage patterns with standard extensions.
2. The application processes user input that could potentially be used in templates or database queries.
3. The application maintains user sessions for authentication or state management.
4. The application is publicly accessible rather than being limited to an internal network.
5. The application is deployed in multiple environments (development, testing, production).
