# MITIGATION STRATEGIES

This document outlines mitigation strategies specific to the AI Nutrition-Pro application architecture described in the provided FILE.

## Mitigation Strategy: Robust API Key Management

*   **Description:** Implement a secure lifecycle for API keys issued to Meal Planner applications. This includes procedures for secure generation, distribution, rotation, and revocation of keys. Keys should have minimal necessary permissions via ACLs (as mentioned in existing security). Consider mechanisms like key expiration and monitoring usage patterns to detect potential compromise. Developers should use secure key storage mechanisms (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager) rather than hardcoding keys.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Compromise of Meal Planner API Key (Severity: Medium to High)
    *   Unauthorized access via compromised credentials (Severity: Medium to High)
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to the API Application and associated data/functionality resulting from compromised or leaked API keys. Improves control over external system access.
*   **Currently Implemented:** The architecture mentions "Authentication with Meal Planner applications - each has individual API key." and "Authorization of Meal Planner applications - API Gateway has ACL rules". This indicates keys are used and authorized, but the lifecycle management details are not specified.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Specific procedures and tooling for secure key generation, distribution, rotation, expiration, revocation, and storage best practices for developers are not described as implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: Comprehensive Input Validation and Sanitization

*   **Description:** Implement strict validation on all input received by the API Gateway and, crucially, again within the API Application. This involves checking data types, formats, lengths, and acceptable values. Before any user-provided input is used in database queries, internal logic, or passed to the external LLM (ChatGPT), it must be thoroughly sanitized to remove or neutralize potentially harmful characters or structures (e.g., SQL injection attempts, script tags, prompt injection attempts).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Input validation bypass on API Gateway or API Application (Severity: Medium)
    *   Abuse of LLM (ChatGPT-3.5) via injection attacks (Severity: High - specifically prompt injection)
    *   Data exfiltration/tampering from Databases via injection (Severity: High - e.g., SQL injection)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via malformed requests (Severity: High)
*   **Impact:** Reduces the attack surface significantly by ensuring only expected and safe data is processed by the application logic, databases, and the external LLM. Directly counters various injection and malformed-input attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** The API Gateway is described as providing "filtering of input". The extent and nature of this filtering are not detailed. Validation/sanitization within the API Application is not explicitly mentioned.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Detailed specification and implementation of input validation rules at the API Gateway and, critically, comprehensive sanitization and validation within the API Application before processing data or interacting with databases/LLM.

## Mitigation Strategy: LLM Interaction Security and Monitoring

*   **Description:** Implement specific controls around the interaction with the ChatGPT-3.5 LLM. This includes carefully crafting prompts using prompt engineering techniques to minimize the risk of prompt injection. Sanitize *all* user-provided data that is incorporated into the prompt or sent to the LLM. Monitor the volume and nature of requests made to the LLM to detect abusive patterns or unexpectedly high costs. Consider implementing filters or checks on the *output* received from the LLM before presenting it to the user, to mitigate risks of harmful, biased, or nonsensical content.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Abuse of LLM (ChatGPT-3.5) (Severity: High - cost, content quality, potential data leakage if sensitive data is sent)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via excessive LLM calls (Severity: High)
*   **Impact:** Mitigates financial risks associated with excessive LLM usage and reduces the risk of the application generating harmful or low-quality content due to malicious or unexpected input. Protects against potential data leakage to the LLM (assuming sensitive data isn't *intended* to be sent).
*   **Currently Implemented:** The architecture mentions the API Application "Utilizes ChatGPT for LLM-featured content creation". Specific security measures around this interaction (prompt engineering, sanitization, monitoring, output filtering) are not mentioned.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implementation of prompt engineering best practices, sanitization of LLM inputs, monitoring of LLM usage/cost, and potentially filtering/validation of LLM output.

## Mitigation Strategy: Principle of Least Privilege for Database Access

*   **Description:** Configure database access controls (IAM roles for RDS) for the Web Control Plane and API Application containers based strictly on the principle of least privilege. The Control Plane application should only have permissions necessary to read/write data in the Control Plane Database. The API Application should only have permissions necessary to read/write data in the API Database. Neither application should have administrative access to the databases or access to the *other* application's database.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data exfiltration/tampering from Databases (Control Plane DB, API DB) (Severity: High)
    *   Compromise of containerized applications leading to widespread data breach (Severity: High)
*   **Impact:** Limits the blast radius of a successful compromise of either the Web Control Plane or the API Application. Prevents an attacker who gains access to one container from automatically gaining full access to all application data.
*   **Currently Implemented:** The architecture states that applications "read/write data" to their respective databases using TLS. Specific IAM roles and their configured permissions (least privilege) are not detailed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicit confirmation and configuration details demonstrating that database access for the Web Control Plane and API Application strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege using fine-grained IAM roles.

## Mitigation Strategy: Secure Administrator Access to Control Plane

*   **Description:** Implement strong security measures for Administrator access to the Web Control Plane. This must include Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all administrative accounts. Access should be restricted to specific trusted networks or require secure remote access methods (e.g., VPN). Role-based access control (RBAC) within the control plane application should ensure administrators only have permissions necessary for their specific duties.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Compromise of Web Control Plane or Administrator credentials (Severity: Critical)
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized administrative access, which could lead to system-wide configuration changes, data breaches (tenants, billing), or service disruption.
*   **Currently Implemented:** The architecture mentions "Administrator" interacts with the "Web Control Plane" to "Configure system properties". Specific security controls for this access (MFA, network restrictions, RBAC) are not mentioned.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implementation of MFA, network access restrictions, and detailed RBAC for Administrator access to the Web Control Plane.

## Mitigation Strategy: Resource Limits and Rate Limiting Enforcement

*   **Description:** Configure resource limits (CPU, memory) for the ECS tasks running the Web Control Plane and API Application to prevent a single instance from consuming excessive resources and impacting others. Ensure the API Gateway's rate limiting is effectively configured based on expected usage patterns per Meal Planner application (using the API key identity). Monitor resource utilization and API Gateway metrics to detect potential DoS attempts or resource exhaustion issues.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) or resource exhaustion (Severity: High)
    *   Abuse of LLM (ChatGPT-3.5) leading to excessive cost (Severity: High - rate limiting on API calls can indirectly limit LLM calls)
*   **Impact:** Protects the application's availability by preventing individual components from being overwhelmed and limits the potential financial impact of excessive external service usage caused by high request volumes.
*   **Currently Implemented:** The API Gateway is described as providing "rate limiting". Resource limits for ECS tasks are not explicitly mentioned.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Specific configuration details for API Gateway rate limits (e.g., limits per key, burst limits) and explicit configuration of resource limits (CPU/Memory) for the ECS tasks running the applications. Monitoring for resource exhaustion needs to be in place.
