# Mitigation Strategies for Screenshot-to-Code

## 1. Secure API Key Management

- **Mitigation strategy**: Implement secure storage and handling of API keys for external services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate).

- **Description**:
  1. Move all API key validation and usage to the backend only
  2. Implement key rotation mechanisms
  3. Add usage monitoring to detect abnormal patterns
  4. Store keys in a secure credential store rather than .env files
  5. Implement server-side validation of API keys before use

- **Threats mitigated**:
  - API key leakage (High severity) - prevents unauthorized access to paid AI services
  - Financial exposure (High severity) - prevents potential charges from unauthorized API usage
  - Account compromise (Medium severity) - prevents misuse of user accounts on third-party services

- **Impact**:
  - Significantly reduces the risk of API key exposure
  - Limits financial impact if keys are compromised
  - Provides early detection of potential misuse

- **Currently implemented**:
  - Basic environment variable storage for API keys in the backend
  - Client-side key storage in browser (not secure) with fallback to environment variables in `generate_code.py`

- **Missing implementation**:
  - Server-side only API key validation
  - Key rotation mechanisms
  - Usage monitoring and alerting
  - Secure credential storage beyond environment variables

## 2. Restrictive CORS Policy

- **Mitigation strategy**: Implement a restrictive CORS policy that only allows access from trusted domains.
