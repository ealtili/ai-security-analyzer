# Mitigation Strategies for Screenshot-to-Code

## 1. Secure API Key Management

- **Description**:
  Implement comprehensive API key protection throughout the application lifecycle. When users provide API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Replicate, etc.), store them only in the browser's local storage on the frontend or in environment variables on the backend. Implement key rotation policies and usage monitoring to detect unusual patterns. For self-hosted deployments, provide clear guidance on securely managing API keys.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  API key exposure (High severity) - Unauthorized actors could use exposed API keys to make requests to AI services, potentially incurring large costs or performing malicious actions.

- **Impact**:
  Significantly reduces the risk of API key theft and unauthorized usage. Limits potential financial impact from compromised keys.

- **Currently Implemented**:
  The application uses environment variables (`.env` files) for storing API keys on the backend. The frontend stores keys in browser local storage. The README states "Your key is only stored in your browser. Never stored on our servers." The code in `generate_code.py` extracts API keys either from client-side settings dialog or environment variables.

- **Missing Implementation**:
  No key rotation mechanisms or API usage monitoring/alerts. No explicit validation of API key formats before use. No encryption for API keys stored in browser local storage.

## 2. Content Security Policy for Generated Code

- **Description**:
  Implement a strict Content Security Policy when rendering generated code previews. Create a sandboxed environment for code previews that prevents the execution of potentially malicious scripts. Use iframe sandboxing with appropriate restrictions (e.g., `allow-scripts` but not `allow-same-origin`). Add CSP headers that restrict resource loading and script execution.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High severity) - Generated code could contain malicious JavaScript that executes in the context of the user's browser.
  Data exfiltration (Medium severity) - Malicious code could steal sensitive information from the user's browser.

- **Impact**:
  Significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks and data theft through code previews.

- **Currently Implemented**:
  No evidence of CSP implementation in the provided code files.

- **Missing Implementation**:
  No CSP headers or sandbox restrictions for code previews. No content sanitization for generated code.

## 3. Input Validation and Image Processing Controls

- **Description**:
  Enhance the existing image processing pipeline to enforce stricter controls. Implement comprehensive validation for all inputs, including size, format, and content type validation. Continue enforcing maximum dimensions and file size limits for uploaded images. Add additional checks for potentially malicious image content.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  Denial of Service (Medium severity) - Extremely large images could consume excessive server resources.
  Server-side vulnerabilities (Medium severity) - Malformed images could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in image processing libraries.

- **Impact**:
  Reduces the risk of resource exhaustion attacks and potential image-based exploits.

- **Currently Implemented**:
  The application has basic image processing that enforces maximum dimensions and file size limits before sending to AI APIs.

- **Missing Implementation**:
  No comprehensive validation for all image inputs. No checks for malicious image content or format validation.

## 4. Resource Limiting and Timeouts

- **Description**:
  Implement more comprehensive resource controls throughout the application. Set appropriate timeouts for all external API calls to prevent hanging connections. Add request size limits to prevent excessive resource consumption. Implement queue-based processing for resource-intensive operations to maintain system stability under load.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  Denial of Service (Medium severity) - Resource exhaustion from processing extremely complex or large inputs.
  API service disruptions (Medium severity) - Hanging connections to external services.

- **Impact**:
  Ensures the application remains stable and responsive even when processing complex inputs or during API service disruptions.

- **Currently Implemented**:
  Some API calls include timeout parameters (e.g., for OpenAI). The screenshot endpoint in `routes/screenshot.py` uses a 60-second timeout for httpx.AsyncClient.

- **Missing Implementation**:
  No consistent timeout policies across all API integrations. No queuing system for expensive operations. No comprehensive request size limits.

## 5. Secure External API Communication

- **Description**:
  Enhance the security of communication with external APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). Always use HTTPS for API requests. Implement validation of API responses before processing. Add explicit error handling for various API failure scenarios. When users configure custom OpenAI proxy URLs, validate these URLs to ensure they include the required path components and use HTTPS.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  Data interception (Medium severity) - Sensitive data could be intercepted if not transmitted securely.
  Server-Side Request Forgery (Medium severity) - Malicious proxy configurations could redirect requests to internal services.

- **Impact**:
  Ensures secure and reliable communication with external services and prevents potential SSRF attacks through proxy configurations.

- **Currently Implemented**:
  The application uses HTTPS for API calls and has error handling for common OpenAI API errors in `generate_code.py` (AuthenticationError, NotFoundError, RateLimitError).

- **Missing Implementation**:
  No validation of user-provided OpenAI proxy URLs. Inconsistent error handling across different API integrations.

## 6. Rate Limiting

- **Description**:
  Implement rate limiting for all API endpoints to prevent abuse. Add per-IP and per-user rate limits for resource-intensive operations. Implement progressive backoff for repeated requests. Set up monitoring to detect abnormal request patterns.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  API abuse (Medium severity) - Excessive requests could lead to service degradation.
  Financial impact (Medium severity) - Excessive API calls to paid services could result in unexpected costs.

- **Impact**:
  Prevents API abuse, reduces costs from excessive API usage, and helps maintain service stability.

- **Currently Implemented**:
  No evidence of rate limiting in the provided code files.

- **Missing Implementation**:
  No rate limiting middleware for API endpoints. No progressive backoff mechanisms for repeated requests.

## 7. Secure Configuration Management

- **Description**:
  Enhance configuration management practices to prevent security issues. Validate all user-provided configuration settings (like OpenAI proxy URLs) before use. Implement secure defaults for all configuration options. Provide clear documentation on secure configuration practices for self-hosted deployments.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  Insecure configuration (Medium severity) - Misconfigured settings could introduce security vulnerabilities.
  Server-Side Request Forgery (Medium severity) - Malicious configuration could lead to unauthorized internal requests.

- **Impact**:
  Prevents security issues stemming from misconfiguration and reduces the attack surface.

- **Currently Implemented**:
  The application uses environment variables for configuration and has some default settings.

- **Missing Implementation**:
  No validation of user-provided configuration settings. No secure defaults for all configuration options.

## 8. Secure Error Handling

- **Description**:
  Implement consistent error handling practices that prevent information disclosure. Show generic error messages to users in production while logging detailed error information server-side. Ensure debug information is only available in development environments. Add structured error logging to facilitate troubleshooting without exposing sensitive information.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  Information disclosure (Low severity) - Sensitive information could be leaked through detailed error messages.

- **Impact**:
  Prevents leakage of sensitive information while maintaining troubleshooting capabilities.

- **Currently Implemented**:
  The application has error handling in `generate_code.py` that catches and processes specific OpenAI errors. The WebSocket endpoint in this file uses a custom error code `APP_ERROR_WEB_SOCKET_CODE` for app errors.

- **Missing Implementation**:
  No consistent error handling across all components. No structured error logging system. No guarantee that detailed errors are never exposed to users in production.

## 9. Secure Temporary File Management

- **Description**:
  Implement secure practices for managing temporary files generated during debugging or evaluation processes. Use randomly generated filenames to prevent path traversal. Set appropriate file permissions. Implement automatic cleanup of temporary files after use. Store sensitive temporary files outside of web-accessible directories.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  Unauthorized access to temporary files (Low severity) - Temporary debug or output files could be accessed if not properly secured.

- **Impact**:
  Prevents unauthorized access to temporary files that might contain sensitive information.

- **Currently Implemented**:
  The application uses temporary file storage for debugging and in `video/utils.py` for video processing. The video processing code uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=True)` which automatically cleans up files after use, and uses `uuid.uuid4()` to generate unique directory names.

- **Missing Implementation**:
  No explicit file permission controls. No consistent cleanup for all temporary files across the application.

## 10. Client-Side Data Protection

- **Description**:
  Implement measures to protect user data on the client side. Use secure browser storage (localStorage) with clear expiration policies. Add options for users to clear stored data. Implement client-side encryption for sensitive data when appropriate. Provide clear privacy notices about data handling.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  Unauthorized access to stored data (Medium severity) - Data stored in browser could be accessed by other applications in shared environments.

- **Impact**:
  Enhances protection of user data stored in the browser and gives users more control over their data.

- **Currently Implemented**:
  The application stores user API keys in browser localStorage.

- **Missing Implementation**:
  No data expiration policies. No client-side encryption for sensitive data. No clear data clearing options for users.

## 11. Path Traversal Prevention in Evaluation Processing

- **Description**:
  Implement strict path validation and sanitization in the evals-related routes to prevent path traversal attacks. Use path normalization to resolve and validate all user-provided folder paths. Restrict access to only authorized evaluation directories. Use safe path joining methods that prevent directory traversal.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  Path Traversal (High severity) - Attackers could potentially access unauthorized files or directories on the server through crafted folder path parameters in evals routes.

- **Impact**:
  Prevents unauthorized file access through evaluation folder parameters, protecting sensitive server files and configurations.

- **Currently Implemented**:
  The application uses `Path` from `pathlib` in `routes/evals.py` which helps with path manipulation, but doesn't include specific validation against traversal.

- **Missing Implementation**:
  No validation or sanitization of user-provided folder paths in evals endpoints. No explicit checks against directory traversal attempts. No restriction of allowed evaluation directories.

## 12. Video Processing Security Controls

- **Description**:
  Enhance security of the video processing pipeline. Implement strict validation of video formats, sizes, and durations before processing. Set limits on number of frames processed to prevent resource exhaustion. Ensure the temporary files created during video processing are properly secured and cleaned up after processing.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  Resource Exhaustion (Medium severity) - Maliciously crafted videos could consume excessive server resources.
  Temporary File Disclosure (Low severity) - Temporary frames extracted from videos could be accessible if not properly secured.

- **Impact**:
  Prevents video-based denial of service attacks and protects potentially sensitive content from video frames.

- **Currently Implemented**:
  The application uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=True)` for video processing in `video/utils.py`, which automatically deletes files when closed. There is a `TARGET_NUM_SCREENSHOTS` constant set to 20 to limit frame extraction.

- **Missing Implementation**:
  No validation of video format, size, or duration before processing. No explicit error handling for malformed videos. No validation of the video data URL format.
