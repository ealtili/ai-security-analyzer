## Vulnerability: Insecure File Upload

- **Description**
  - The application provides an endpoint (for example, in `server.py`) that receives images from external users to convert screenshots into code.
  - There is no clear file-type or content verification before processing the uploaded files. An attacker can craft a malicious file (e.g., a file that appears to be an image but contains hidden executable code).
  - Once uploaded, the file may be placed in a directory and handled by various Python libraries without additional checks or sandboxing.
  - This can allow malicious code to persist on the server or enable subsequent exploits that target the parsing or processing phase.

- **Impact**
  - Potential introduction of malicious files into the environment (e.g., webshells disguised as images, leading to remote code execution).
  - Server compromise, data exfiltration, or pivot to launch further attacks against the hosting infrastructure.

- **Vulnerability Rank**
  - High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**
  - None appear to be present in the current project. There is no visible code in the repository that validates file uploads against a whitelist or checks file signature.

- **Missing Mitigations**
  - Strict file-type checking (verifying the true MIME type and limiting acceptable extensions).
  - Scanning and sanitizing uploaded files (e.g., using antivirus or security tools).
  - Using a sandboxed or unprivileged environment to handle or store uploaded files.

- **Preconditions**
  - The server (e.g., Flask app) is publicly reachable.
  - Attackers can upload files without any form of authentication or authorization.

- **Security Test Case**
  1. Deploy the screenshot-to-code application in a publicly accessible environment.
  2. Craft a file that has a valid image header but contains embedded executable code or script (e.g., a polyglot PNG).
  3. Submit the file to the application’s upload endpoint for conversion.
  4. Verify that the server accepts the file and processes it without rejecting or sanitizing it.
  5. Observe server logs or filesystem to confirm the file was stored or processed in an unsafe manner.


## Vulnerability: Potential Code Injection via Untrusted Image Parsing

- **Description**
  - The application processes user-submitted images using standard Python libraries (e.g., Pillow or similar).
  - Attackers can craft an image that exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the image-processing library. For example, an overlong chunk in a PNG or specialized malicious data in EXIF headers.
  - When the server loads this file for AI/ML inference or conversion, the vulnerable library code can trigger arbitrary code execution under the server’s runtime privileges.

- **Impact**
  - Full remote code execution (RCE) if the underlying image library or associated dependencies have a flaw.
  - Complete server compromise, data exfiltration, or pivoting to lateral attacks within the hosting environment.

- **Vulnerability Rank**
  - Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**
  - The project relies on standard libraries without additional safeguards. There is no apparent custom check to filter out suspicious headers or parse only strictly valid formats.

- **Missing Mitigations**
  - Sanitizing or transcoding images to a safe format (e.g., converting everything to a trusted intermediate format) before deeper analysis.
  - Running the parsing code in a restricted container or sandbox to prevent high-impact compromise if a vulnerability is triggered.
  - Regularly updating and monitoring the libraries for known vulnerabilities.

- **Preconditions**
  - The attacker can successfully upload a specially crafted image.
  - The server side uses unpatched or outdated image-processing libraries, or newly discovered zero-day flaws exist.

- **Security Test Case**
  1. Obtain or create a malicious image file that targets a known security vulnerability in Pillow or a similar library.
  2. Run the screenshot-to-code application in a test environment.
  3. Send the malicious file via the public endpoint, ensuring the application parses it for screenshot-to-code conversion.
  4. Check server behavior for crashing processes, memory corruption errors, or unexpected shell access.
  5. Validate that the exploit leads to partial or full compromise of the server if the vulnerability is unpatched.
