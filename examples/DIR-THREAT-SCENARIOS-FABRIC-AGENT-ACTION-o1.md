# THREAT SCENARIOS

- Malicious pull requests from forked repositories abuse GitHub Actions to extract secrets and compromise workloads
- Adversaries inject code into Docker build, enabling unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive environment variables
- Compromised dependencies allow remote attackers to gain code execution, pivoting inside workflows and stealing credentials
- Insufficient permission checks let unauthorized users run the action, leading to escalations and data compromises
- OpenAI API misuse raises costs, plus unauthorized content generation with personal or proprietary user data
- Publicly accessible logs inadvertently contain secrets, enabling attackers to harvest credentials and orchestrate widespread intrusions
- Attackers exploit automated pattern selection with crafted instructions, causing tool usage and damaging repository integrity
- Continuous integration misconfigurations expose privileged tokens, permitting malicious push access and stealthy unwanted code modifications

# THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS

- We considered code injection likelihood, unauthorized usage, and secrets exposure
- Each scenario’s probability was compared against the severity of compromise
- We emphasized real vulnerabilities over improbable advanced persistent threat attacks
- Complex scenarios were deprioritized unless overshadowed by high-value secrets risk
- Controls were matched carefully to the highest likelihood threat vectors

# RECOMMENDED CONTROLS

- Restrict workflow triggering from forked PRs or untrusted branches, reducing unauthorized code execution opportunities significantly
- Enforce mandatory review and approvals before merging changes, preventing accidental or malicious modifications to workflows
- Use GitHub’s environment protection rules for secrets, ensuring minimal exposure and restricting access to credentials
- Implement robust secrets scanning, automatically detecting and blocking exposed API keys within commits and logs
- Pin dependencies to known good versions, monitoring for vulnerabilities and performing security patch updates promptly
- Limit Docker container privileges, ensuring rootless images and reduced runtime capabilities across builds or pipelines
- Scrub logs and redact secrets, guaranteeing that sensitive tokens never appear in outputs or artifacts
- Adopt strict RBAC for GitHub and Docker usage, restricting privileged actions to authorized personnel only

# NARRATIVE ANALYSIS

Threat modeling for this GitHub Action revolves around controlling unauthorized code execution, especially by external pull requests or compromised dependencies. Our main focus is how secrets—like OpenAI API keys—might be misused, exposed, or exfiltrated by those exploiting improperly restricted workflow runs or Docker builds.

By emphasizing known real-world scenarios (e.g., secrets in logs, malicious PRs, vulnerable dependencies), we can prioritize practical defenses that effortlessly integrate with GitHub’s security features and best practices for Docker containerization.

# CONCLUSION

This balanced threat model highlights realistic attack vectors and practical mitigations that collectively safeguard workflows, secrets, and critical project assets from genuine adversarial threats.
