Below is a new list of mitigation strategies based on the architecture described in the FILE. Each mitigation strategy includes a detailed description, the threats it mitigates, their severity, the impact of the strategy, whether it is currently implemented, and what is missing in its implementation.

---

1. **Mitigation Strategy:** Use unique per-tenant API keys with regular rotation

   - **Description:**
     1. Assign a distinct API key to each Meal Planner application when it onboards.
     2. Enforce key rotation at a defined interval (e.g., every 90 days) or upon suspected compromise.
     3. Store keys securely (e.g., in a dedicated secrets manager), restricting who can access them.
     4. Validate the API key at the API Gateway before any request is processed.

   - **Threats Mitigated:**
     - **Unauthorized access to the API (High severity):** Prevents stolen or leaked credentials from being used indefinitely.
     - **Escalation of privileges across tenants (High severity):** Ensures one tenant’s key cannot be used to access another tenant’s data.

   - **Impact:**
     - Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized usage by isolating each tenant and limiting the window of exposure if a key is compromised.

   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - Individual API key issuance is mentioned (“Authentication with Meal Planner applications - each has individual API key”).

   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - Formal key rotation policy and automated tooling to rotate and revoke keys as needed.
     - Secure key storage in a secrets manager (if not already present).

2. **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce granular ACL rules and strict request validation at the API Gateway

   - **Description:**
     1. Define strict ACL rules at the gateway that identify and permit only the expected endpoints/actions for each Meal Planner application.
     2. Validate all incoming requests against these ACL rules before forwarding to the backend services.
     3. Return an immediate denial to any request that does not match the defined scope (method, path, or action).

   - **Threats Mitigated:**
     - **Abuse of API endpoints (High severity):** Prevents malicious clients from calling endpoints not intended for them.
     - **Unauthorized data access attempts (High severity):** Controls precisely which data and operations are allowed per client.

   - **Impact:**
     - Greatly reduces the attack surface by ensuring that only valid, pre-approved calls are permitted.

   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - API Gateway already implements ACL rules (“Authorization of Meal Planner applications - API Gateway has ACL rules…”).

   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - More granular, per-tenant or per-feature ACL definitions if currently only broad or coarse rules exist.
     - Ongoing policy updates as new endpoints or features are added.

3. **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce thorough sanitization of content before sending it to ChatGPT

   - **Description:**
     1. At the API Gateway or backend API layer, strip or encode any dangerous characters or scripts embedded in the user-provided content.
     2. Validate the length, format, and type of input before forwarding to ChatGPT.
     3. Ensure prompt construction does not unintentionally leak sensitive data or secrets.

   - **Threats Mitigated:**
     - **Injection attacks (Medium severity):** Safeguards against malicious payloads that could manipulate LLM behavior or cause undesired outputs.
     - **Data leakage or unintended prompts (Medium severity):** Minimizes the risk of forwarding sensitive or unvalidated data to ChatGPT.

   - **Impact:**
     - Reduces the likelihood that attackers can manipulate or coerce ChatGPT via harmful prompts.

   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - Basic filtering may exist (“filtering of input” is mentioned under API Gateway).

   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - A robust, context-specific sanitization routine that systematically checks and transforms user inputs.
     - Content validation rules tailored to the LLM usage (e.g., no HTML tags, no special control sequences, etc.).

4. **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit storage of ChatGPT requests and responses in the API Database

   - **Description:**
     1. Store only the minimal necessary fields from requests and responses (e.g., short excerpt for debugging, but not full transcripts).
     2. Apply a retention policy that deletes or anonymizes older records after a set period.
     3. Restrict access to logs and stored requests/responses to essential personnel only.

   - **Threats Mitigated:**
     - **Sensitive data exposure (High severity):** Minimizes the window in which private or confidential data is stored and potentially compromised.
     - **Large-scale data breach (High severity):** Reduces the impact if the database is compromised, since less data is retained.

   - **Impact:**
     - Significantly controls potential data leakage by minimizing stored information from the LLM interaction.

   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - The architecture mentions that requests and responses to the LLM are stored in the API database, but no explicit retention or minimization policy is described.

   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - Clear policy and technical controls to enforce data minimization.
     - Automated purge or anonymization processes.

5. **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce strict role-based access controls (RBAC) in the Web Control Plane

   - **Description:**
     1. Define distinct roles (Administrator, App Onboarding Manager, Meal Planner application manager) with their respective permissions.
     2. Validate user roles at every critical function in the control plane (e.g., altering billing configurations, provisioning new tenants).
     3. Enforce least-privilege principles, ensuring roles cannot exceed their intended scope.

   - **Threats Mitigated:**
     - **Privilege misuse by internal staff or compromised accounts (High severity):** Prevents a single role from making impactful changes or accessing unnecessary data.
     - **Unauthorized modifications to system/billing data (High severity):** Restricts critical actions to only the intended role(s).

   - **Impact:**
     - Greatly decreases the possibility of malicious or accidental misuse of high-privilege functions in the control plane.

   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - The architecture refers to the existence of multiple user roles but does not outline the enforced structure or how strictly roles are separated.

   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - Fine-grained per-role permissions and robust enforcement for all control plane endpoints.
     - Automated checks or gating logic to prevent role escalation.

6. **Mitigation Strategy:** Maintain strict segregation between Control Plane Database and API Database

   - **Description:**
     1. Use separate AWS subnets or security groups so that only the Web Control Plane can communicate with the Control Plane Database, and only the API Application can communicate with the API Database.
     2. Configure database user privileges so each service has only the required rights (read/write, table-level restrictions, etc.).
     3. Restrict cross-database connectivity to eliminate the possibility of one service reading another service’s data.

   - **Threats Mitigated:**
     - **Unauthorized data crossover (Medium severity):** Prevents the scenario where an attacker gaining access to one database can pivot into the other.
     - **Lateral movement between services (Medium severity):** Reduces the risk of widespread compromise from a single foothold.

   - **Impact:**
     - Reduces the overall blast radius of a single database compromise and enforces clear separation of responsibilities.

   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - Architecture references two distinct Amazon RDS instances (Control Plane Database and API database).

   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - Detailed network segmentation at the subnet/security group level if not already fully in place.
     - Database-level privilege checks (ensuring each database user can only access relevant tables).

These mitigation strategies address specific risks posed by the **AI Nutrition-Pro** application architecture. They focus on realistic, high-impact controls rather than general best practices like monitoring or audits. By implementing these strategies, the project can substantially reduce the likelihood and impact of unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse of the system’s capabilities.
