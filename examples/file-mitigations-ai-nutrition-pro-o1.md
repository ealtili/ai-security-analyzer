Below is an updated list of mitigation strategies based on the application architecture and newly observed risks. Each strategy is focused on threats introduced by AI Nutrition-Pro’s design, especially regarding multi-tenant usage, external LLM interactions, and control-plane configuration.

---

### Mitigation Strategy 1: Enforce Unique Per-Tenant API Keys with Granular ACL

- **Description**
  - Ensure each Meal Planner application receives a unique API key.
  - Configure API Gateway ACL rules to allow or deny specific actions on a per-tenant basis.
  - Regularly rotate API keys to minimize the window of opportunity if a key is compromised.
  - Restrict back-end endpoints so that each tenant can only access data within its own scope.

- **Threats Mitigated**
  - *Threat:* Unauthorized access to endpoints or data by malicious or compromised Meal Planner applications (severity: high).
  - *Threat:* Cross-tenant data exposure if ACLs are not granular (severity: high).

- **Impact**
  - Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized or malicious requests reaching the AI Nutrition-Pro service.
  - Limits blast radius in case of credential leakage.

- **Currently Implemented**
  - API Gateway already provides basic ACL features and unique API keys for each Meal Planner application.

- **Missing Implementation**
  - Formalized key rotation schedule and automated revocation process.
  - More granular ACL rules to strictly limit resource access per tenant.

### Mitigation Strategy 2: Rate Limiting for Meal Planner Requests

- **Description**
  - Configure and enforce stricter rate limiting at the API Gateway.
  - Define per-tenant request quotas to match expected usage patterns.
  - Implement automated alerts or lockouts if usage spikes beyond threshold.

- **Threats Mitigated**
  - *Threat:* Denial-of-service scenarios where a single tenant overloads the system (severity: medium).
  - *Threat:* Uncontrolled consumption of resources leading to billing misuse (severity: medium).

- **Impact**
  - Reduces system overload risk and helps contain unintentional or malicious spikes in traffic.
  - Ensures fair usage across all tenants.

- **Currently Implemented**
  - A basic rate-limiting configuration exists in the API Gateway.

- **Missing Implementation**
  - Per-tenant or more granular rate-limiting and automated lockout thresholds.

### Mitigation Strategy 3: Input Sanitization for LLM Prompts (Malicious Prompt Handling)

- **Description**
  - Validate and sanitize any user-provided dietitian content or other text that will be sent to ChatGPT.
  - Strip or escape problematic tokens and language that could lead to injection or malicious prompt manipulation.
  - Perform minimal lexical checks to remove obviously harmful scripting tags or unusual tokens.

- **Threats Mitigated**
  - *Threat:* Prompt injection attacks that could steer ChatGPT into disclosing sensitive information or creating harmful content (severity: high).
  - *Threat:* Malicious content stored in the AI Nutrition-Pro database and reused in further LLM calls (severity: medium).

- **Impact**
  - Significantly reduces the likelihood of ChatGPT responding with unintended or harmful content based on injected prompts.

- **Currently Implemented**
  - Basic input filtering at the API Gateway level.

- **Missing Implementation**
  - Context-aware text sanitization or prompt validation specifically tailored to LLM usage.

---

### Mitigation Strategy 4: Automated or Manual LLM Output Moderation

- **Description**
  - Implement checks on ChatGPT’s responses before storing or serving them to Meal Planner clients.
  - If any disallowed or suspicious output is detected (e.g., sensitive data exposed, malicious links, or unexpected personal information), reject or flag the content.
  - Provide an escalation path for manual review if the system flags potentially dangerous responses.

- **Threats Mitigated**
  - *Threat:* Injection of disallowed or malicious text into the system (severity: medium).
  - *Threat:* Accidental disclosure of private or proprietary information from ChatGPT’s responses (severity: medium).

- **Impact**
  - Reduces the likelihood of distributing harmful content to end users.
  - Lowers risk of brand damage or liability from inappropriate responses.

- **Currently Implemented**
  - No explicit LLM output moderation layer described in the architecture.

- **Missing Implementation**
  - A dedicated moderation and review mechanism to validate ChatGPT outputs.

### Mitigation Strategy 5: Enforce Tenant Isolation in Control Plane Database

- **Description**
  - Use separate schemas, row-level security, or other strong isolation techniques for each tenant in the Control Plane Database.
  - Verify that the Web Control Plane only permits operations on the data belonging to the authenticated tenant.
  - Periodically review queries and service layers to ensure strict logical separation between tenants.

- **Threats Mitigated**
  - *Threat:* Cross-tenant data leakage (severity: high).
  - *Threat:* Escalation of privilege where one client can access another’s billing or configuration data (severity: high).

- **Impact**
  - Protects privacy and compliance requirements for each tenant.
  - Minimizes scope of compromise if one tenant is breached.

- **Currently Implemented**
  - Single database with known multi-tenant design, but no detailed mention of isolation method.

- **Missing Implementation**
  - Configurable or enforced schema isolation or row-level access controls at the database layer.

---

### Mitigation Strategy 6: Strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in the Web Control Plane

- **Description**
  - Assign each user (Administrator, App Onboarding Manager, Meal Planner manager) only the minimum privileges needed to perform their role.
  - Enforce these roles in the Web Control Plane logic and require re-authentication or higher privileges for critical actions (e.g., changing systemwide settings).
  - Log administrative actions separately to facilitate quick identification of misconfigurations.

- **Threats Mitigated**
  - *Threat:* Unauthorized changes to system properties or billing configuration (severity: high).
  - *Threat:* Privilege escalation attacks if roles are not strictly enforced (severity: high).

- **Impact**
  - Greatly reduces the chance of administrative misconfigurations from lower-privileged accounts.
  - Limits the damage if a lower-level account is compromised.

- **Currently Implemented**
  - Basic admin-level authentication is mentioned, but role distinctions are not clearly outlined.

- **Missing Implementation**
  - Detailed role definitions and enforcement in application logic.
  - Fine-grained checks preventing role bypass.

---

### Mitigation Strategy 7: Data Minimization for ChatGPT Requests

- **Description**
  - Send ChatGPT only minimal context (e.g., summary of dietitian content) instead of full user or tenant data.
  - Remove or mask identifiable information prior to forwarding requests to the external LLM.
  - Strictly define prompt templates that avoid accidental leakage of sensitive details.

- **Threats Mitigated**
  - *Threat:* Leakage of sensitive or private data to external LLM provider (severity: medium).
  - *Threat:* Unnecessary data retention in ChatGPT logs outside the system’s control (severity: low to medium).

- **Impact**
  - Reduces privacy and compliance risks.
  - Limits exposure if ChatGPT or its logs are compromised.

- **Currently Implemented**
  - ChatGPT integration is outlined, but no mention of data minimization steps.

- **Missing Implementation**
  - Defined guidelines for what data is strictly necessary in ChatGPT requests.
  - Automated data masking or trimming toolchain.

These mitigation strategies address the real-world threats posed by AI Nutrition-Pro’s multi-tenant architecture, external LLM interactions, and the need for robust compartmentalization of client data. By incrementally implementing each of these strategies, the development team will substantially reduce the overall risk to the AI Nutrition-Pro system.
