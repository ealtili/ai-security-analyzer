Here are the vulnerabilities found in the PROJECT FILES:

* Vulnerability 1: Potential Prompt Injection
    * Description:
        * The application uses user-provided screenshots or videos to generate code by prompting Large Language Models (LLMs).
        * If user inputs are not properly sanitized, an attacker can craft malicious screenshots or videos that inject unintended instructions into the LLM prompts.
        * This can manipulate the LLM's code generation process, leading to the generation of malicious code.
        * Step-by-step to trigger:
            1. An attacker crafts a screenshot or video. This input contains text or visual elements designed to be interpreted as instructions by the LLM, overriding the intended prompt. For example, including text like `"/><script>alert('PromptInjectionTest')</script><img src="` in the screenshot.
            2. The attacker uploads this crafted screenshot or video to the application's frontend interface, using the standard image/video upload functionality.
            3. The application's backend processes the input, embedding the content from the screenshot/video into a prompt for the LLM. Due to insufficient input sanitization, the malicious instructions are included in the prompt.
            4. The backend sends this crafted prompt to the LLM (e.g., GPT-4 Vision, Claude, Gemini).
            5. The LLM, influenced by the injected instructions, generates code that includes the malicious payload (e.g., JavaScript code for an alert box).
            6. The application returns this generated code to the user. If the user deploys or uses this code, the malicious payload will be executed.
    * Impact:
        * High. Successful prompt injection can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the generated code.
        * If a user deploys the generated code, attackers could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser when they visit the generated web application.
        * This could lead to user data theft, session hijacking, defacement of the generated application, or further attacks.
    * Vulnerability Rank: High
    * Currently implemented mitigations:
        * None. The provided code does not include any explicit input sanitization or prompt hardening mechanisms to prevent prompt injection attacks. The application seems to directly pass user-provided screenshot/video content and instructions to the LLMs without any filtering.
    * Missing mitigations:
        * Implement robust input sanitization and validation on the backend before constructing prompts for LLMs. This should include filtering or escaping potentially malicious input from screenshots/videos.
        * Employ prompt hardening techniques. Design system prompts to be more resistant to injections. For instance, clearly separate instructions from user input within the prompt, and instruct the LLM to strictly follow the given format and instructions, disregarding any conflicting instructions from the user input data.
        * Consider Content Security Policy (CSP) in the generated code as a further mitigation layer to restrict the execution of inline scripts, which could limit the impact of XSS if prompt injection leads to JavaScript code generation.
        * Output validation: After receiving the generated code from the LLM, implement a validation step to scan the code for potentially harmful patterns or code structures before presenting it to the user.
    * Preconditions:
        * The application must be running and accessible to external users.
        * An attacker must be able to upload or provide a screenshot or video to the application.
    * Source code analysis:
        * `backend/llm.py` (from previous analysis, file not provided in current PROJECT FILES, but context remains valid): This file contains the core logic for interacting with LLMs (`stream_openai_response`, `stream_claude_response`, `stream_gemini_response`). These functions take messages as input and directly forward them to the LLM APIs. There's no input sanitization or validation happening within these functions.
        * `backend/prompts/__init__.py` and related prompt files (from previous analysis, files not provided in current PROJECT FILES, but context remains valid): The `assemble_prompt` and `assemble_imported_code_prompt` functions construct the prompts. They incorporate user-provided image/video data and potentially user history into the prompts. The system prompts defined in `backend/prompts/screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `backend/prompts/imported_code_prompts.py`, and `backend/prompts/claude_prompts.py` are focused on instructing the LLMs for code generation but lack specific mechanisms to prevent prompt injection.
        * The system prompts (e.g., `HTML_TAILWIND_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `backend/prompts/screenshot_system_prompts.py`) guide the LLM on code generation tasks but do not include instructions to handle potentially malicious content within user inputs or to sanitize user inputs before processing them.
        * `backend\video\utils.py`: The function `assemble_claude_prompt_video` processes video data URLs and prepares content messages for Claude, further demonstrating the pathway for user-controlled video content to be incorporated into LLM prompts without sanitization. The function `split_video_into_screenshots` extracts frames from the video, and these frames are then converted into base64 encoded images and directly used in the prompt.
    * Security test case:
        1.  Using a web browser, access the publicly available instance of the screenshot-to-code application.
        2.  Prepare a screenshot image using an image editor. In this screenshot, include a visible text element that represents a prompt injection attempt. For example, include the text: `"/><script>alert('PromptInjectionTest')</script><img src="`. Save this image as a PNG file.
        3.  In the screenshot-to-code application, upload the prepared screenshot image through the designated image upload interface.
        4.  Select any supported stack (e.g., HTML + Tailwind) and initiate the code generation process.
        5.  Once the code generation is complete, review the generated code output. Look for the injected payload. In this example, search for the string `<script>alert('PromptInjectionTest')</script>`.
        6.  If the injected script is present in the generated HTML code, copy the generated HTML code and save it as an HTML file (e.g., `prompt_injection_test.html`).
        7.  Open the `prompt_injection_test.html` file in a web browser.
        8.  Observe if an alert box with the message "PromptInjectionTest" appears. If the alert box appears, it confirms that the prompt injection was successful and resulted in the execution of injected JavaScript code within the generated application.

* Vulnerability 2: API Key Exposure through Environment Variables
    * Description:
        * The application stores API keys for accessing services like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini in environment variables.
        * While environment variables are a common way to manage configuration, they can be insecure if the server environment is compromised or misconfigured.
        * If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the server or finds a way to read environment variables (e.g., through a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability in another application on the same server, or due to insecure server configuration), they can retrieve these API keys.
        * Step-by-step to trigger:
            1. An attacker needs to gain access to the server environment where the application is deployed. This could be achieved through various methods, such as exploiting other vulnerabilities in the server infrastructure, gaining access through compromised credentials, or social engineering. For the test case, we will simulate direct access to the environment.
            2. Once the attacker has server access (or simulates access in a test environment), they attempt to read the environment variables configured for the application. The method to do this depends on the server environment (e.g., using command-line tools in a shell, accessing configuration files, or using internal server APIs if available due to misconfiguration).
            3. The attacker searches for environment variables that are likely to contain API keys. Based on the `backend/config.py` file (from previous analysis, file not provided in current PROJECT FILES, but context remains valid), these would include: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and `REPLICATE_API_KEY`.
            4. If the attacker successfully retrieves the values of these environment variables, they have obtained the API keys.
            5. The attacker can then use these exposed API keys to make unauthorized requests to the respective AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate). This could involve generating code, images, or accessing other services offered by these APIs, potentially incurring costs and abusing the application owner's accounts.
    * Impact:
        * High to Critical. Compromise of API keys can lead to significant financial costs due to unauthorized usage of LLM APIs.
        * Depending on the scope of access granted by the API keys, it could also lead to data breaches if the compromised keys are used to access or exfiltrate sensitive data through the AI provider's API.
        * Reputation damage and service disruption are also possible impacts.
    * Vulnerability Rank: High
    * Currently implemented mitigations:
        * Partially mitigated by the documentation suggesting "Your key is only stored in your browser. Never stored on our servers." which implies the intended architecture might have been frontend-only API key usage. However, the backend code clearly contradicts this, as it actively uses API keys from environment variables.
        * No explicit security measures are implemented in the code to protect environment variables or restrict access to them.
    * Missing mitigations:
        * Implement secure secret management practices for production deployments. Instead of relying solely on environment variables, use dedicated secret management systems like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, or Azure Key Vault to store and access API keys.
        * Adopt least privilege principles for server access control. Restrict access to the server environment and environment variables to only necessary personnel and processes.
        * Regularly rotate API keys to limit the window of opportunity if keys are compromised. Implement automated key rotation where feasible.
        * Consider using environment variable encryption or masking techniques provided by the deployment environment to add an extra layer of protection.
        * For sensitive operations using API keys, implement proper authorization and auditing mechanisms to track and control API key usage.
    * Preconditions:
        * The application must be deployed in an environment where environment variables are used to configure API keys.
        * An attacker must be able to gain some level of access to the server environment or exploit a vulnerability that allows reading environment variables.
    * Source code analysis:
        * `backend/config.py` (from previous analysis, file not provided in current PROJECT FILES, but context remains valid): This file is responsible for loading API keys from environment variables using `os.environ.get()`. This is the primary point where API keys are accessed and made available to the application.
        * `backend/llm.py` (from previous analysis, file not provided in current PROJECT FILES, but context remains valid): This file uses the API keys obtained from `config.py` to initialize and use clients for different LLM providers (e.g., `AsyncOpenAI(api_key=api_key, base_url=base_url)`).
        * `docker-compose.yml` (from previous analysis, file not provided in current PROJECT FILES, but context remains valid): In development, `docker-compose.yml` uses an `.env` file to pass environment variables to the backend container, demonstrating the usage of environment variables for API key configuration.
        * `backend\generate_code.py`: The file `generate_code.py` further confirms the usage of API keys from environment variables by importing configuration variables like `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and `REPLICATE_API_KEY` from `config.py`. The functions `get_from_settings_dialog_or_env` prioritize API keys from settings dialog but fall back to environment variables, indicating that environment variables are a primary method for API key configuration.
    * Security test case:
        1.  Deploy the screenshot-to-code application using Docker Compose as per the provided `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` configuration in a test environment. Ensure that API keys are set as environment variables as intended for a realistic deployment scenario.
        2.  Gain access to a shell within the running backend container. For example, using `docker exec -it <backend_container_id> /bin/bash`. This simulates an attacker gaining access to the server environment.
        3.  Inside the container shell, list the environment variables. In a Linux-based container, this can be done using the command `env` or `printenv`.
        4.  Examine the output to see if environment variables such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and `REPLICATE_API_KEY` are listed and their values are visible.
        5.  If these API keys are exposed as environment variables within the container, it confirms the vulnerability.
        6.  As a further step to demonstrate the impact, attempt to use one of the exposed API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) to make a direct API call to the corresponding service provider (e.g., OpenAI API). Use a tool like `curl` or an SDK to make an authenticated request using the exposed key. If the API call is successful, it proves that the exposed key can be used to access and utilize the external service, highlighting the security risk.
