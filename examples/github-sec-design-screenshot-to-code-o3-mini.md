# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project aims to accelerate the design-to-development process by automatically converting screenshots into code. It is intended for rapid prototyping, helping designers and developers quickly iterate on UI ideas while potentially lowering the time-to-market for web and mobile application development. The project is currently open source but could be evolved into a SaaS offering or an integrated tool within existing design ecosystems. Business priorities include improving developer productivity, reducing manual coding effort in UI generation, and maintaining competitive differentiation through innovation in design automation.

Business Goals:
• Provide a reliable conversion from visual designs into code with a high degree of accuracy.
• Integrate seamlessly into existing design and development workflows.
• Evolve the tool into a commercially viable solution if adoption increases.

Business Risks:
• Poor conversion accuracy may result in reduced trust in the tool and increased manual rework.
• Exposure of proprietary design assets if screenshots contain sensitive intellectual property.
• Dependencies on third-party and open source libraries that might introduce vulnerabilities.
• Misuse or unauthorized replication of copyrighted design elements.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
• security control: The project source code is managed in a GitHub repository with branch protection rules and enforced code reviews.
• security control: GitHub Actions (if configured) provide automated vulnerability scanning and SAST during pull requests.
• security control: Basic network security is provided by the hosting platform if deployed in a cloud environment.

Accepted risks:
• accepted risk: Dependency on open source libraries that may have undiscovered vulnerabilities is currently tolerated in this early stage.
• accepted risk: Limited logging and monitoring in the development stage is an acceptable risk until production hardening is performed.

Recommended security controls:
• security control: Integrate a comprehensive CI/CD security pipeline including SAST, DAST, and dependency vulnerability scanning.
• security control: Enforce strong authentication and authorization measures for any production or SaaS deployments, potentially using OAuth2 or similar mechanisms.
• security control: Validate and sanitize all user inputs such as image uploads to mitigate injection and file-based attacks.
• security control: Utilize TLS for all data in transit, and enable encryption for data at rest in both the database and file storage.
• security control: Implement API rate limiting and input size restrictions to guard against denial-of-service attacks.

Security requirements:
• authentication: Secure methods must be implemented for any user-facing components; consider multi-factor authentication if accounts are supported.
• authorization: Role-based access controls must restrict access to configuration management, deployment functions, and sensitive operations.
• input validation: All inputs—including image files—must be rigorously validated and sanitized to prevent exploits and injection attacks.
• cryptography: Enforce TLS for communication channels and ensure sensitive data (credentials, proprietary designs) is encrypted both in transit and at rest. These requirements should be enforced through standard practices, including hardened configurations on cloud services and defined secure coding guidelines.

# DESIGN

## DEPLOYMENT

The project can be deployed using a containerized microservices architecture in a cloud environment. One recommended solution is to deploy the service on a managed Kubernetes cluster (or similar container orchestration platform). The Ingress Controller will expose the service securely over HTTPS, while managed services will be used for the database and storage components.

Below is a deployment diagram visualizing this recommended architecture:

```mermaid

    USER[User]
    INGRESS[Ingress Controller]

    MANAGED_DB[Managed Database Service]

    INGRESS -->|Routes Traffic| APP_SERVICE
    APP_SERVICE -->|Reads/Writes Data| MANAGED_DB

The following table describes the elements in the deployment diagram:

| Name                  | Type                | Description                                                                         | Responsibilities                                                        | Security controls                                                           |

## BUILD

The build process is automated through a CI/CD pipeline integrated with GitHub Actions. A commit to the repository triggers the pipeline, which runs static analysis, SAST scans, unit and integration tests. On successful validation, container images are built and pushed to a secure container registry. Build artifacts are stored and tagged for traceability.

Below is a diagram illustrating the build and publish workflow:

```mermaid

```

Key security controls in the build process include:
• Ensuring reproducible builds by pinning dependency versions.
• Running automated security tests (SAST, dependency scans, linters) to catch vulnerabilities early.
• Securing the container registry and build artifacts with proper access control and vulnerability scanning.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes to protect:
• The core conversion functionality that transforms screenshots into code, which is central to customer value.
• The ML inference process that processes potentially sensitive design assets.
• The integration points (APIs) that allow external systems to leverage the service.

Data to protect and their sensitivity:
• Uploaded screenshots may contain proprietary UI designs and sensitive intellectual property, representing high sensitivity.
• Generated code artifacts, while less sensitive, are still critical as they embody automated derivations from proprietary designs.
• Potential user account details (if a sign-in is provided) which would include PII, requiring high protection.
• Metadata and logs that could indicate system behavior and usage patterns, which need controlled access.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
• Does the service require user authentication and authorization, or is it entirely open-access?
• What is the expected user load and concurrency level for the service?
• Will the ML inference functionality be run in-house or depend on third-party APIs?
• Are there any legal or compliance considerations regarding the handling of proprietary design assets?
• What is the desired level of logging, monitoring, and alerting for production deployments?
• How critical is high availability versus cost optimization in the deployment architecture?

Assumptions:
• The service accepts user-uploaded screenshots which may contain sensitive or proprietary designs.
• The current implementation is in an early development phase with basic security measures; further hardening is planned for production readiness.
• The project is containerized and is expected to be deployed on a cloud platform with managed services for storage and data persistence.
• The GitHub repository and CI/CD pipeline form the foundation for code management, automated testing, and vulnerability scanning.
• Secure communication channels (e.g., TLS) will be used for all external interactions.
• The overall architecture is designed to be iteratively improved as the project scales and its threat model matures.
