## Attack Surface Analysis for AI Nutrition-Pro Application

The AI Nutrition-Pro application integrates AI-driven content generation with dietary planning, introducing several critical attack surfaces. Below is the prioritized analysis of medium, high, and critical risks specific to the architecture:

---

### 1. **API Gateway Authentication & Input Validation**
**Description**: The Kong API Gateway handles authentication, rate limiting, and input filtering. Weaknesses here could allow unauthorized access or injection attacks.
**Contribution to Attack Surface**:
- API keys for Meal Planner apps could be leaked or poorly managed.
- Insufficient input validation might permit SQLi or malicious payloads.
**Example**: An attacker brute-forces API keys due to lax rate limiting, gaining access to dietitian content.
**Impact**: Unauthorized data access/modification, service disruption.
**Risk Severity**: **Critical**
**Current Mitigations**: TLS encryption, API key authentication.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Regular API key rotation/revocation.
- Advanced input sanitization (e.g., regex validation for payloads).
- Multi-factor authentication for admin access [1][3].

---

### 2. **LLM (ChatGPT-3.5) Integration Vulnerabilities**
**Description**: The Backend API relies on ChatGPT-3.5 for content generation, creating risks from prompt injection or data leakage.
**Contribution to Attack Surface**:
- Maliciously crafted prompts could manipulate LLM outputs.
- Sensitive data (e.g., dietitian samples) might leak via insecure API calls.
**Example**: An attacker injects prompts to generate biased or harmful dietary advice.
**Impact**: Reputational damage, regulatory non-compliance.
**Risk Severity**: **High**
**Current Mitigations**: HTTPS/REST encryption for API calls.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Output filtering to detect/block malicious content.
- Context-aware input validation to restrict unexpected prompts [7][12].

---

### 3. **Control Plane Database Exposure**
**Description**: The Amazon RDS-based Control Plane Database stores tenant configurations and billing data.
**Contribution to Attack Surface**:
- SQL injection via Web Control Plane.
- Excessive admin privileges or lack of encryption at rest.
**Example**: Attackers exploit misconfigured IAM roles to exfiltrate billing data.
**Impact**: Financial fraud, tenant data breaches.
**Risk Severity**: **High**
**Current Mitigations**: TLS for data in transit.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Encryption at rest using AWS KMS.
- Least-privilege access controls and regular audit logs [9][13].

---

### 4. **Meal Planner Application Integration Risks**
**Description**: External Meal Planner apps interact with the API Gateway via API keys.
**Contribution to Attack Surface**:
- Compromised API keys could allow impersonation.
- Insecure ACL rules might permit unauthorized actions.
**Example**: A leaked API key enables attackers to upload malicious content samples.
**Impact**: Data integrity loss, unauthorized content generation.
**Risk Severity**: **High**
**Current Mitigations**: API key authentication, TLS.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Short-lived tokens with OAuth2.0.
- Behavioral analysis to detect anomalous API usage [4][5].

---

### 5. **API Database Storage of Sensitive Content**
**Description**: The API Database stores dietitian content samples and LLM request/response logs.
**Contribution to Attack Surface**:
- Unencrypted PII in logs or samples.
- Inadequate access controls for database queries.
**Example**: Insider threats export dietitian content via unsecured backups.
**Impact**: Privacy violations, intellectual property theft.
**Risk Severity**: **Medium**
**Current Mitigations**: TLS for database connections.
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Column-level encryption for sensitive fields.
- Masking of LLM logs in non-production environments [7][9].

---

### 6. **Web Control Plane Admin Access**
**Description**: The Golang-based Web Control Plane manages system configuration and billing.
**Contribution to Attack Surface**:
- Compromised admin credentials could lead to full system takeover.
- Lack of audit trails for configuration changes.
**Example**: Phishing attacks target admins to alter billing thresholds.
**Impact**: Financial loss, service misconfiguration.
**Risk Severity**: **High**
**Current Mitigations**: Role-based access control (RBAC).
**Missing Mitigations**:
- Session timeout policies and MFA enforcement.
- Immutable audit logs for critical actions [3][11].

### Summary
The AI Nutrition-Pro applicationâ€™s integration of external LLMs and third-party Meal Planner apps introduces unique risks, particularly around API security and data integrity. Prioritize hardening the API Gateway, implementing stricter input/output validation for ChatGPT, and encrypting sensitive database fields. Regular audits of IAM roles and API key lifecycle management are essential to reduce exposure.
