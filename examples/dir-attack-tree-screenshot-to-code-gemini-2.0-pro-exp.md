Okay, let's update the attack tree based on the new project files. The new files provide more detail about the evaluation endpoints, video processing, and screenshot capabilities, which introduce new potential attack vectors and refine existing ones.

**Refined Objective (Remains the same):**

Attacker's Goal: To obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data (API keys, generated code, user-provided screenshots) or to manipulate the application's functionality to generate malicious code or disrupt service for legitimate users.

**Updated Attack Tree (Text-based Visualization):**

*   **1. Compromise Application (Root)**
    *   **1.1. Exploit LLM Prompt Injection** (Existing, Refined)

        *   **Description:**  The core of the application is taking user input (screenshots, text descriptions, video data URLs, filenames) and feeding them into an LLM prompt. An attacker could craft a malicious screenshot, text input, or video designed to manipulate the LLM.  The new `evals.py` file reveals endpoints for running and comparing evaluations, which could be targets for prompt injection if the evaluation inputs are not properly sanitized. The `generate_code.py` file shows how prompts are created and how different LLMs are used, highlighting the complexity of the attack surface. The video processing functionality (`video/utils.py`) significantly increases the attack surface due to the complexity of video processing and the potential for manipulating the LLM with a sequence of frames.

        *   **Actionable Insights:**
            *   **Strengthen Input Sanitization:**  Extend strict input sanitization and validation to *all* user-provided inputs, including image metadata, filenames, video data URLs, and evaluation inputs.  Specifically, validate the structure and content of data URLs.
            *   **Review System Prompts:**  Review and strengthen the system prompts for all LLMs used, including those used for video processing (e.g., `VIDEO_PROMPT`).
            *   **Output Validation (Evals):** Implement output validation for the evaluation endpoints.  Check the generated HTML for malicious patterns or unexpected content.
            *   **Video Frame Sanitization:**  Implement checks on the *number* and *content* of frames extracted from videos.  Reject videos with an excessive number of frames.  Consider using image analysis techniques to detect potentially malicious content within frames.
            *   **Prompt Injection Detection:** Explore more advanced prompt injection detection techniques, potentially using separate models to analyze inputs before they reach the main LLMs.
            *   **Context Limits:**  Enforce strict limits on the amount of context provided to the LLM, especially for video processing.

        *   **Likelihood:** High (The application's core functionality relies on LLMs and user-provided content)

        *   **Impact:** High (Could lead to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or denial of service)

        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of prompt engineering and the target LLM's vulnerabilities)

        *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High

        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be difficult to detect without sophisticated input and output validation)

    *   **1.2. Abuse API Key Management** (Existing, Refined)

        *   **Description:** The application uses API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate, and ScreenshotOne. The `generate_code.py` file shows how API keys are retrieved from environment variables or user input. The `screenshot.py` file shows how a user-provided ScreenshotOne API key is used.  This creates multiple potential attack vectors: leaking keys, using stolen keys, or exhausting quotas.

        *   **Actionable Insights:**
            *   **Backend Key Storage (Confirmed):**  The code confirms that API keys are *intended* to be passed from the frontend to the backend.  This is a **critical vulnerability**.  The backend should *never* trust API keys provided by the frontend.
            *   **Mandatory Backend Proxying:**  **All** API calls (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate, ScreenshotOne) *must* be proxied through the backend.  The frontend should *never* directly communicate with these services.  The backend should use its own securely stored API keys.
            *   **ScreenshotOne API Key Handling:**  The `/api/screenshot` endpoint is particularly vulnerable.  An attacker could provide their own ScreenshotOne API key and use the application's backend to take screenshots of arbitrary websites, potentially bypassing restrictions or incurring costs for the application owner.  This endpoint *must* be secured or removed.
            *   **Key Rotation (Reinforced):**  Encourage users to regularly rotate their API keys (for all services).
            *   **Least Privilege (Reinforced):** Encourage users to use API keys with the minimum necessary permissions.
            *   **Rate Limiting/Monitoring (Backend):** Implement rate limiting and monitoring on the backend for *all* API calls, not just those to LLMs.

        *   **Likelihood:** High (The current architecture relies on client-provided API keys, which is inherently insecure)

        *   **Impact:** High (Compromised API keys can lead to significant financial losses, data breaches, and reputational damage)

        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Stealing keys from local storage or intercepting requests is relatively easy)

        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium

        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring API usage and logs)

    *   **1.3. Exploit Dependencies** (Existing, No Changes)

        *   **Description:** Remains the same.

        *   **Actionable Insights:** Remains the same.

        *   **Likelihood:** Medium

        *   **Impact:** Medium to High

        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium

        *   **Skill Level:** Low to High

        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **1.4. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Image URLs** (Existing, Refined)

        *   **Description:**  The application fetches images from URLs provided by the LLM (for placeholder images). The risk remains, but the new files don't introduce new SSRF vulnerabilities.

        *   **Actionable Insights:** Remains the same.

        *   **Likelihood:** Medium

        *   **Impact:** High

        *   **Effort:** Medium

        *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High

        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **1.5. Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion** (Existing, Refined)

        *   **Description:**  The new files introduce new potential DoS vectors:
            *   **Video Processing:**  Uploading large or complex videos could consume significant server resources.
            *   **Evaluation Endpoints:**  Sending a large number of requests to the `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, or `/best-of-n-evals` endpoints could overwhelm the server.
            *   **Screenshot Endpoint:**  Repeatedly calling the `/api/screenshot` endpoint with different URLs could exhaust the ScreenshotOne API quota or consume server resources.

        *   **Actionable Insights:**
            *   **Rate Limiting (Expanded):** Implement strict rate limiting on *all* API endpoints, including the evaluation and screenshot endpoints.
            *   **Video Size/Duration Limits:**  Enforce strict limits on the size and duration of uploaded videos.
            *   **Screenshot Rate Limiting (Backend):**  Implement rate limiting on the backend for the ScreenshotOne API, even if the user provides their own API key.
            *   **Evaluation Request Limits:** Limit the number of concurrent evaluations and the complexity of evaluation requests.

        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High

        *   **Impact:** Medium (Service disruption)

        *   **Effort:** Low

        *   **Skill Level:** Low

        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring server resource usage and API quotas)

    *   **1.6. Data Leakage via Debugging/Logging** (Existing, No Changes)

        *   **Description:** Remains the same.

        *   **Actionable Insights:** Remains the same.

        *   **Likelihood:** Low

        *   **Impact:** Medium to High

        *   **Effort:** Low

        *   **Skill Level:** Low

        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **1.7. Video Processing Vulnerabilities** (Existing, Refined)

        *   **Description:** The `video/utils.py` file provides more details about video processing. The use of `moviepy` and temporary files introduces potential vulnerabilities.

        *   **Actionable Insights:**
            *   **`moviepy` Updates (Reinforced):** Ensure `moviepy` is kept up-to-date to address any security vulnerabilities.
            *   **Secure Temporary File Handling:**  Review the use of temporary files in `video/utils.py`. Ensure that temporary files are created securely and deleted promptly. Use the most secure methods available for creating temporary files.
            *   **Input Validation (Video):**  Validate the video input (format, size, duration, number of frames) *before* processing. Reject invalid or excessively large videos.
            *   **Resource Limits (Video):**  Limit the resources (memory, CPU, processing time) allocated to video processing.
            *   **Isolate Processing (Video):** Consider processing videos in an isolated environment (e.g., a separate container or virtual machine) to limit the impact of any vulnerabilities.

        *   **Likelihood:** Medium

        *   **Impact:** Medium to High

        *   **Effort:** Medium

        *   **Skill Level:** Medium

        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **1.8. Exploiting Evaluation Endpoints (`evals.py`)**

        *   **Description:** The `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, and `/best-of-n-evals` endpoints allow users to compare the outputs of different models or runs. An attacker could potentially:
            *   **Read Arbitrary Files:**  If the `folder` parameter is not properly validated, an attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the server by providing a malicious path.
            *   **Exhaust Resources:**  Submit a large number of evaluation requests, or requests with very large files, to consume server resources.
            *   **Prompt Injection (Indirect):** If the evaluation process involves feeding the generated HTML back into an LLM, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the generated HTML to influence the evaluation results.

        *   **Actionable Insights:**
            *   **Strict Path Validation:**  Implement *very* strict validation of the `folder` parameter in the evaluation endpoints.  Only allow paths within a specific, sandboxed directory.  Do *not* allow absolute paths or paths that traverse outside the intended directory. Use `os.path.realpath` and `os.path.commonpath` to prevent path traversal attacks.
            *   **Input Sanitization (Evaluation):** Sanitize the HTML content read from files *before* displaying it or using it in any further processing.
            *   **Rate Limiting (Evaluation):** Implement rate limiting on the evaluation endpoints.
            *   **Resource Limits (Evaluation):** Limit the size and number of files that can be processed in a single evaluation request.

        *   **Likelihood:** Medium

        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Could lead to file disclosure, denial of service, or potentially code execution)

        *   **Effort:** Medium

        *   **Skill Level:** Medium

        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring file access and logs)

**Key Changes and Additions:**

*   **1.8. Exploiting Evaluation Endpoints:** This is a new attack vector identified based on the `evals.py` file.
*   **Refinement of Existing Vectors:** The descriptions and actionable insights for several existing attack vectors (1.1, 1.2, 1.5, 1.7) have been refined based on the new code.
*   **Emphasis on Backend Proxying:** The analysis strongly emphasizes the critical vulnerability of client-provided API keys and the absolute necessity of proxying all API calls through the backend.
*   **Video Processing Risks:** The risks associated with video processing are highlighted, including resource exhaustion and potential vulnerabilities in `moviepy`.
* **ScreenshotOne API abuse:** Added details about ScreenshotOne API abuse.

This updated attack tree provides a more comprehensive and detailed analysis of the threats facing the application, taking into account the new code files. The most critical vulnerability remains the handling of API keys, which requires immediate attention. The addition of evaluation endpoints and video processing capabilities also introduces significant new risks.
