## TRUST BOUNDARIES

1. **User to Application**: The boundary between the end-user and the Flask application.
2. **Application to Database**: The boundary between the Flask application and the SQLite database.
3. **Application to Celery**: The boundary between the Flask application and the Celery task queue.
4. **Application to External Services**: The boundary between the Flask application and any external services it interacts with, such as Redis for Celery.
5. **CI/CD Environment**: The boundary between the source code repository and the CI/CD pipeline.

## DATA FLOWS

1. **User Requests**: User sends HTTP requests to the Flask application.
2. **Database Queries**: Application queries the SQLite database for user data and blog posts.
3. **Task Submission**: Application submits tasks to Celery for background processing.
4. **Task Results**: Celery returns task results to the application.
5. **Session Management**: User session data is stored and retrieved by the application.
6. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Code is pushed to the repository and processed by the CI/CD pipeline.

## APPLICATION THREATS

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | STRIDE CATEGORY | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 0001 | User Authentication | Credential Stuffing | Spoofing | User authentication is vulnerable to automated attacks using stolen credentials. | Not mitigated in design. | Implement rate limiting and CAPTCHA on login attempts. | High likelihood due to commonality of credential leaks. | High impact as it could lead to unauthorized access. | High |
| 0002 | Database | SQL Injection | Tampering | User inputs are directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization. | Not mitigated in design. | Use parameterized queries and ORM to prevent SQL injection. | Medium likelihood if inputs are not sanitized. | High impact as it could lead to data breach. | High |
| 0003 | Session Management | Session Hijacking | Information Disclosure | Session data is stored in cookies which can be intercepted. | Secure cookies are used. | Ensure cookies are marked as HttpOnly and Secure. | Medium likelihood if cookies are not properly secured. | High impact as it could lead to account takeover. | High |
| 0004 | Celery Task Queue | Task Manipulation | Tampering | Tasks can be manipulated if Celery is not properly secured. | Not mitigated in design. | Use message signing and authentication for Celery tasks. | Low likelihood if Celery is properly configured. | Medium impact as it could disrupt service. | Medium |
| 0005 | Application Code | Code Injection | Tampering | Untrusted data is used in code execution paths. | Not mitigated in design. | Validate and sanitize all inputs before processing. | Medium likelihood if inputs are not validated. | High impact as it could lead to arbitrary code execution. | High |

# DEPLOYMENT THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS

1. **Deployment Environment**: The servers and infrastructure where the application is deployed.
2. **Network Configuration**: Network settings and firewall rules that protect the deployment environment.
3. **Secrets Management**: Tools and services used to manage sensitive information like API keys and passwords.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES

1. **Internet to Deployment Environment**: The boundary between the public internet and the deployment environment.
2. **Deployment Environment to Database**: The boundary between the deployment environment and the database server.
3. **Deployment Environment to External Services**: The boundary between the deployment environment and any external services it interacts with.

## DEPLOYMENT THREATS

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 0001 | Deployment Environment | Unauthorized Access | The deployment environment is exposed to the internet. | Not mitigated in design. | Implement network segmentation and firewalls. | High likelihood if not properly secured. | High impact as it could lead to full system compromise. | Critical |
| 0002 | Secrets Management | Secret Leakage | Secrets are stored in environment variables or files. | Not mitigated in design. | Use a secrets management tool to securely store and access secrets. | Medium likelihood if secrets are not properly managed. | High impact as it could lead to data breach. | High |

# BUILD THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS

1. **Source Code**: The codebase of the application.
2. **Build Artifacts**: Compiled code and other artifacts generated during the build process.
3. **CI/CD Configuration**: Configuration files and scripts used in the CI/CD pipeline.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES

1. **Source Code Repository to CI/CD Pipeline**: The boundary between the code repository and the CI/CD pipeline.
2. **CI/CD Pipeline to Deployment Environment**: The boundary between the CI/CD pipeline and the deployment environment.

## BUILD THREATS

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 0001 | CI/CD Pipeline | Supply Chain Attack | Dependencies are not verified for integrity. | Not mitigated in design. | Implement dependency scanning and verification. | Medium likelihood due to reliance on third-party packages. | High impact as it could lead to compromised builds. | High |
| 0002 | Source Code Repository | Code Tampering | Unauthorized changes to the codebase. | Not mitigated in design. | Use code signing and access controls. | Medium likelihood if access controls are weak. | High impact as it could lead to malicious code execution. | High |

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

1. **Questions**:
   - Are there any existing security measures in place for the deployment environment?
   - How is sensitive data currently being protected in the application?
   - What is the current process for managing dependencies and third-party packages?

2. **Assumptions**:
   - The application is deployed in a cloud environment with standard security practices.
   - The CI/CD pipeline is used for automated builds and deployments.
   - The application relies on third-party packages for some of its functionality.
