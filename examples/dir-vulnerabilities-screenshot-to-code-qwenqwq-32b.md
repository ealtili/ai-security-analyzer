Here are the identified vulnerabilities in the provided project, formatted according to your specifications:

---

### Vulnerability 1: Insecure CORS Configuration (High)
**Description**
The FastAPI application uses a CORS middleware with `allow_origins=["*"]`, enabling unrestricted cross-origin requests. This allows any website to interact with the API, potentially enabling Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or data leakage.

**Trigger**
An attacker hosts a malicious website that sends requests to the `/generate-code` endpoint with arbitrary origins. The CORS configuration permits these requests, allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users or access sensitive API responses.

**Impact**
Attackers can execute unauthorized API operations, such as generating code with malicious inputs or exhausting API quotas. Sensitive API response data may be leaked to malicious domains.

**Rank** High
**Current Mitigations** None explicitly configured.
**Missing Mitigations**
- Restrict `allow_origins` to specific trusted domains.
- Implement CSRF protection tokens.
**Preconditions** None.
**Source Code Analysis**
In `backend/main.py`, the CORS setup uses `allow_origins=["*"]` (line 14-17).
```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

### Vulnerability 2: Exposure of API Keys in Environment Variables (High)
**Description**
API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and others are stored in environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). If these variables are exposed in logs, misconfigured deployments, or source control, attackers can gain access to paid services, leading to financial loss.

**Trigger**
An attacker accesses the `.env` file in a misconfigured deployment or cloud storage, or retrieves keys from error logs containing unhandled exceptions.

**Impact**
Attackers can exploit leaked keys to generate thousands of API requests, incurring costs or depleting quotas. Malicious code generation could be triggered using the compromised keys.

**Rank** High
**Current Mitigations** Environment variables are used, which is better than hardcoding but insufficient on its own.
**Missing Mitigations**
- Use a secrets management tool (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Vault) for production.
- Prevent logging of sensitive data.
**Preconditions** None.
**Source Code Analysis**
API keys are referenced in `backend/config.py` (lines 5-7):
```python
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", None)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", None)
GEMINI_API_KEY = os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY", None)
```

### Vulnerability 3: Lack of Rate Limiting (High)
**Description**
The `/generate-code` endpoint and image/video APIs do not implement rate limiting. Attackers can send massive requests to exhaust API quotas, cause service degradation, or perform abuse (e.g., generating spam content).

**Trigger**
An attacker sends thousands of requests to `/generate-code` in rapid succession, triggering excessive API calls to OpenAI/Anthropic services.

**Impact**
API quotas are exhausted, denying service to legitimate users. High costs may be incurred if attackers exploit paid API services.

**Rank** High
**Current Mitigations** None implemented.
**Missing Mitigations**
- Add rate limiting middleware (e.g., using FastAPI's dependencies).
- Monitor and alert on unusual API usage patterns.
**Preconditions** None.
**Source Code Analysis**
No rate limit checks exist in `backend/routes/generate_code.py` (lines 280-300).

---

### Vulnerability 4: Insecure Temporary File Handling (High)
**Description**
The video processing code saves frames to `/tmp` with predictable filenames. Attackers may exploit this to overwrite or read sensitive files via path traversal attacks.

**Trigger**
An attacker crafts a video filename that includes `../../` to manipulate the temporary directory path.

**Impact**
Sensitive data in `/tmp` could be exposed or overwritten, leading to data corruption or privilege escalation.

**Rank** High
**Current Mitigations** None.
**Missing Mitigations**
- Use secure temporary directories with randomized filenames.
- Validate filenames to prevent path traversal.
**Preconditions** Video upload feature must be enabled.
**Source Code Analysis**
Temporary files are saved in `video/utils.py` (line 54-57):
```python
tmp_video_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=suffix, delete=True)
temp_video_file.write(video_bytes)
```

---

### Vulnerability 5: XSS via Unsanitized Image URLs (High)
**Description**
Generated HTML includes image URLs from user input (via `create_alt_url_mapping`). These URLs are directly rendered without sanitization, enabling XSS attacks.

**Trigger**
An attacker submits an image `alt` text containing malicious JavaScript (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`).

**Impact**
Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers, stealing cookies or credentials.

**Rank** High
**Current Mitigations** None.
**Missing Mitigations**
- Sanitize all user-provided URLs and HTML content.
- Use a library like `bleach` to clean inputs.
**Preconditions** User input includes malicious image `alt` text.
**Source Code Analysis**
Image URLs are mapped without sanitation in `image_generation/core.py` (line 12-13):
```python
mapped_image_urls = create_alt_url_mapping(image_cache)
```

---

### Vulnerability 6: Debug Mode Exposure (High)
**Description**
The `DEBUG` flag in `backend/debug/DebugFileWriter.py` writes unfiltered data to disk, potentially exposing sensitive debug information if enabled in production.

**Trigger**
An attacker triggers an error in the system, and debug logs containing API keys or user data are written to accessible directories.

**Impact**
Sensitive data leaks to unauthorized parties via exposed logs.

**Rank** High
**Current Mitigations** The `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` flag controls it, but no guardrails prevent accidental activation in prod.
**Missing Mitigations**
- Disable debug mode in production.
- Validate debug directory paths to prevent path traversal.
**Preconditions** `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` must be True.
**Source Code Analysis**
`DEBUG_DIR` is used unsafely in `backend/debug/DebugFileWriter.py` (line 17):
```python
self.debug_artifacts_path = os.path.expanduser(f"{DEBUG_DIR}/{str(uuid.uuid4())}")
```

---

### Vulnerability 7: Lack of Authentication (High)
**Description**
All API endpoints (e.g., `/generate-code`, `/screenshot`) are accessible without authentication, allowing unauthorized users to generate code or take screenshots of arbitrary URLs.

**Trigger**
An attacker directly accesses the `/generate-code` endpoint to generate malicious code snippets or use API quotas.

**Impact**
Unrestricted access enables API abuse, data exfiltration, or resource exhaustion.

**Rank** High
**Current Mitigations** None.
**Missing Mitigations**
- Implement JWT-based authentication or API keys with permissions.
- Restrict sensitive endpoints to authorized users.
**Preconditions** None.
**Source Code Analysis**
No auth middleware exists in `backend/main.py`.

---

### Vulnerability 8: Hardcoded Mock Data Risks (High)
**Description**
Mock responses in `backend/mock_llm.py` contain hardcoded HTML with placeholder URLs and content. If enabled in production (`SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE=True`), this exposes predictable, potentially malicious content.

**Trigger**
An attacker exploits the mock code to generate predictable responses, bypassing real AI processing to insert malicious HTML.

**Impact**
Malicious code can be injected into generated outputs, compromising frontend users.

**Rank** High
**Current Mitigations** Mock mode is off by default.
**Missing Mitigations**
- Ensure mock mode is disabled in production.
- Sanitize mock data to prevent code injection.
**Preconditions** `SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE` must be True.
**Source Code Analysis**
Hardcoded mocks exist in `backend/mock_llm.py` (line 322-375).

### Mitigation Recommendations
1. **Restrict CORS**: Update CORS origins to trusted domains only.
2. **API Key Security**: Use secrets management and avoid exposing keys in logs.
3. **Implement Rate Limits**: Add middleware to cap request rates.
4. **Input Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all user-provided data.
5. **Secure Temp Files**: Use randomized filenames and restrict directory access.
6. **Enable Authentication**: Require API keys or JWT tokens for access.
7. **Disable Debug Features**: Ensure debug mode is off in production.
8. **Code Reviews**: Audit mock data and mock modes for security flaws.
