5. Threat: Misconfigured cloud services
   Description: Cloud services left with default or overly permissive settings
   Impact: Unauthorized access, data exposure
   Affected Component: Cloud infrastructure
   Current Mitigations: None apparent in code
   Missing Mitigations: Security audits, infrastructure-as-code with secure defaults
   Risk Severity: High

BUILD THREAT MODEL

QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

1. Is there a formal code review process in place?
2. Are there automated security scans integrated into the build process?
3. How are production deployments managed and what access controls are in place?
4. Is there a process for regular security audits of the application and infrastructure?
5. What monitoring and alerting is in place for detecting potential security incidents?

Assumptions:
- The application is intended for production use and handles sensitive user data.
- There is some form of user authentication, though not explicitly shown in the provided code.
- The application is deployed in a cloud environment.
- There is a CI/CD pipeline for builds and deployments, though details are not provided.

This threat model provides an overview of potential security risks in the screenshot-to-code application. It should be regularly reviewed and updated as the application evolves. Implementing the missing mitigations and addressing the highest severity threats should be prioritized to improve the overall security posture of the application.
