## APPLICATION THREATS

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | STRIDE CATEGORY | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 0001 | API Gateway | API key compromise allows spoofing of Meal Planner application | Spoofing | API Gateway authenticates via individual API keys | API Gateway already authenticates using individual API keys as per Security section | Implement additional key rotation and short validity period to reduce exposure time even if compromised | Medium - API keys can be leaked via improper handling in third-party applications | High - Unauthorized access could lead to account compromise and API abuse | High |
| 0002 | API Application | Tampering of dietitian content samples by unauthorized actor | Tampering | Stored samples contain sensitive intellectual property | Not explicitly mentioned as mitigated | Implement appropriate database-level authorization and access control to ensure only authorized internal components access the API Database | Medium - Tampering usually would require internal access or database compromise | High - Could lead to corrupted data and impact trust of the application by end-users | High |
| 0003 | API Gateway | Bypass rate limiting allowing a denial-of-service attack | Denial of Service | Rate limiting is key mitigation against denial of service | Rate limiting enabled in API Gateway, but not explained in detail how extensively | Additional mitigation could be to use Web Application Firewall (WAF) and DDoS protection systems (like AWS Shield) to strengthen existing rate limiting capability | Medium - Attackers persistently exploit public APIs; without further defensive layers, this is plausible | Medium - Could result in service outage but limited by backend resources | Medium |
| 0004 | Backend API | Leakage of sensitive data in requests/responses with ChatGPT due to improper handling | Information Disclosure | AI requests/responses could inadvertently disclose sensitive application content | Not explicitly mentioned as mitigated | Enforce filtering mechanisms to check and sanitize all data included in communications with the external ChatGPT API | Medium - Misinterpretation of interaction with LLM APIs by developers happens frequently | High - Sensitive information exposure could negatively impact data privacy and compliance | High |
| 0005 | Web Control Plane | Abuse or unauthorized access by malicious administrator or compromised admin credentials | Elevation of Privilege | Admin has deep access to system configurations and managing billing information | Not explicitly mentioned as mitigated | Enforce strong MFA and restricted admin access based on roles and minimal privileges model | Medium - Admin credentials can be targeted and compromised | Critical - Administrator access leads to critical data/system compromise | High |

# DEPLOYMENT THREAT MODEL

Possible solutions:
- Application deployed into AWS using Elastic Container Service and Amazon RDS database.

Selected deployment for analysis:
- AWS Elastic Container Service deployment with containers and Amazon RDS databases.

## ASSETS
- Docker container images: A compromised or altered image can lead to a supply-chain type of attack.
- AWS account credentials and environment variables: Controlling deployment and operational access.
- Network communications between containers and external integrations (ChatGPT/API clients).

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
- AWS Elastic Container Service control interface / management boundary
- Databases deployed on Amazon RDS managing data persistence and query access
- Network boundary for containerized applications communicating externally (e.g., ChatGPT)

## DEPLOYMENT THREATS

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 0006 | Docker Images | Malicious or compromised Docker image deployed | Compromised or tampered container images may introduce malicious software into production | No explicit mitigation mentioned | Container image signing and verification integrated into CI/CD; utilize verified AWS ECR repositories and vulnerability assessment tooling | Medium - Supply chain attacks prominent; images should be verified | High - Possibly rapid compromise of core services | High |
| 0007 | AWS ECS Management | Improper ECS/IAM configuration allows unauthorized access | ECS and IAM configuration can be complex, leading to inappropriate permissions | No explicit mitigation mentioned | Rigorously review IAM policies, apply “least privilege” principle, and follow AWS best practices (e.g., security audits, IAM access analyzer) | Medium - Misconfiguration common in cloud infrastructure | High - Compromise of AWS account/resources potentially catastrophic | High |
| 0008 | Network communication | Intercept data exchanged with external ChatGPT API | Traffic to external APIs can traverse untrusted networks | Already encrypted as per security guidelines | Introduce further protection via network-level solutions (e.g., AWS PrivateLink/VPC endpoint connections if supported) | Low - TLS-protected by default, reducing practicality | High - Potential sensitive data exposure | Medium |

# BUILD THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS
- Source code and configurations: critical intellectual property.
- Deployment artifact (Docker image): must remain tamper-resistant to prevent malicious injections.
- CI/CD pipeline credentials and secrets: enabling build and deployment automation.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
- Source Code management system boundary (developers to source code repository)
- CI/CD automation tools boundary (Pipeline runners and automated build environments)

## BUILD THREATS

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
- Assumption: No explicit description of existing CI/CD build security measures; therefore, further detailed security mitigations recommended in build threats.
- Question: Exactly how are AWS and container access credentials managed in deployment?
- Assumption: Administrator account security enforcement (MFA, privilege models) isn't explicitly described in an input; the threat remains realistic and critical.
