- **Web Control Plane (Golang, AWS ECS)**: Manages client onboarding, configuration, and billing data.
- **Control Plane Database (Amazon RDS)**: Stores data related to the control plane.
- **API Application (Golang, AWS ECS)**: Serves AI Nutrition-Pro functionality via APIs.
- **API Database (Amazon RDS)**: Stores dietitian content samples and API responses.
- **Meal Planner Application**: An external application that interacts with the API Gateway to generate AI content.
- **ChatGPT-3.5**: An external LLM solution used for content generation.

### Dependencies

- The application depends on AWS services (ECS, RDS) and integrates with external systems like Meal Planner and ChatGPT-3.5.
- Security measures include API keys, ACL rules, and TLS-encrypted network traffic.
