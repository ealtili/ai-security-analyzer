## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Strategy: Strict API Input Validation at API Gateway

- **Description:**
  Developers should strictly define and enforce input validation policies at the API Gateway level (Kong). These policies must enforce strict checks on data types, schemas, and allowed ranges or inputs. Any invalid or malicious payload would be immediately rejected before touching the backend application infrastructure. To implement this, developers should:
  - Define comprehensive and restrictive schema definitions.
  - Reject any payload not complying with the defined schemas immediately.
  - Ensure controls for special characters and potential injection attacks.

- **Threats mitigated:**
  - Severity: High - Injection attacks attempting to exploit the backend API or databases through malicious inputs.
  - Severity: High - Malformed API calls leading to Denial of Service.

- **Impact:**
  This strategy significantly reduces the risk of injection attacks and potential denial-of-service attacks by quickly discarding suspicious payloads, greatly lowering attack vectors on backend resources.

- **Currently implemented:**
  "Filtering of input" functionality is mentioned at API Gateway (Kong), indicating some degree of input validation is already implemented.

- **Missing implementation:**
  The current state of API Gateway input filtering isn't detailed enough. Developers should verify existing rules comprehensively and explicitly define validation policies if they are missing or incomplete.

### 2. Strategy: Secure Management of API Keys

- **Description:**
  Developers should enforce secure generation, storage, rotation, and revocation processes for API keys issued to Meal Planner applications. Steps for ensuring secure API key management include:
  - Generate strong API keys with sufficient entropy.
  - Store keys securely, ensuring encryption at rest within the Control Plane Database.
  - Provide simple management interfaces in Web Control Plane to rotate and revoke API keys.
  - Implement API Gateway rules to disable immediately revoked or expired API keys.

- **Threats mitigated:**
  - Severity: High - Unauthorized access using compromised API keys.
  - Severity: Medium - Replay attacks and impersonation of legitimate Meal Planner applications.

- **Impact:**
  Proper API key lifecycle management drastically reduces the window of vulnerability in case of accounts compromise, limiting potential damage.

- **Currently implemented:**
  Authentication via individual API keys for Meal Planner applications mentioned in current architecture.

- **Missing implementation:**
  Not explicitly described how API keys storage is implemented or if any revocation//rotation mechanisms currently exist. Missing implementation details should be verified in Web Control Plane.

### 3. Strategy: Principle of Least Privilege in ACL Rules

- **Description:**
  Developers should regularly audit and enforce minimum required privileges within the ACL rules on Kong API Gateway. Recommended steps include:
  - Define exactly which actions and API endpoints each Meal Planner application is authorized to perform/access.
  - Maintain ACL rule sets and explicitly disallow unnecessary operations.
  - Restrict by API endpoint/resource and HTTP verbs strictly required for each client.

- **Threats mitigated:**
  - Severity: Medium - Over-privileged API keys leading to unauthorized access to sensitive endpoints/features.

- **Impact:**
  Reduces lateral movement and exploitation potential in case API keys are compromised or misused.

- **Currently implemented:**
  Mentioned explicitly that ACL rules allow or deny certain actions at API Gateway.

- **Missing implementation:**
  Not explicitly detailed how strict or comprehensive ACL definitions are, further confirmation required by checking actual configurations on API Gateway.

### 4. Strategy: Data Sanitization & Limitations in Request/Response Stored Data

- **Description:**
  Developers must ensure input/output data stored in "API database" (dietitian content samples, requests, and responses to LLM) undergoes appropriate sanitization and limitations. Practical steps include:
  - Sanitize user/dietitian provided data before storing in the database.
  - Enforce strict size limits and quotas per client tenant.
  - Implement proper escaping and querying safeguards in the backend API database interactions.

- **Threats mitigated:**
  - Severity: High - Injection vulnerabilities and database attacks through maliciously constructed user content.
  - Severity: Medium - Data corruption through malicious content.

- **Impact:**
  Proper sanitization greatly reduces system vulnerability to data injection attempts or corruption risks.

- **Currently implemented:**
  Not explicitly mentioned.

- **Missing implementation:**
  Missing clear directives and strategy for validating or sanitizing content samples and requests/responses saved in API database, indicating complete or partial missing implementation.

---

### 5. Strategy: Rate Limiting on API Clients

- **Description:**
  Strong and adaptive rate limiting capabilities are crucial for reducing DoS/DDoS and depletion of application infrastructure. Developers should:
  - Utilize existing Kong API Gateway rate limiting capabilities fully and tune them in alignment with clients' SLA and expected usage.
  - Provide adaptive throttling guidelines and rules in the API gateway configuration.
  - Enforce stricter limits on sensitive API endpoints or for less-trusted API keys.

- **Threats mitigated:**
  - Severity: Medium - Excessive API requests causing degraded backend service availability or application downtime (DoS threats).

- **Impact:**
  Ensures backend infrastructure stability and service reliability under malicious or accidental overload conditions from registered API clients.

- **Currently implemented:**
  Mentioned as a responsibility of API Gateway (Kong).

- **Missing implementation:**
  Needs further detailed verification about how strictly or adaptively current rate limiting policies have been configured and enforced.

---

### 6. Strategy: Control and Validation of Responses from the External LLM (ChatGPT)

- **Description:**
  Implement a backend layer in the API Application to validate responses obtained from ChatGPT before forwarding them to Meal Planner clients or storing in database:
  - Scan and validate returned LLM-generated responses to remove potentially unsafe or inappropriate content.
  - Use automated checks/heuristics for inappropriate words, significant format deviations, length overflows, or injection style content.

- **Threats mitigated:**
  - Severity: Medium - Malicious, adversarial, or corrupted data injection from ChatGPT responses.

- **Impact:**
  Greatly reduces risk associated with compromised or unsafe third-party dependency outputs (ChatGPT), enhancing trustworthiness and correctness of system-generated data.

- **Currently implemented:**
  No explicit validation of responses from ChatGPT specified within the current documentation.

- **Missing implementation:**
  API Application currently directly utilizes ChatGPT responses without documented validation or filtering mechanisms, making implementation fully needed.

---

### 7. Strategy: Secure administration interface and role management

- **Description:**
  The Web Control Plane should implement strong authentication and strict authorization for Administration roles:
  - Configure secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., MFA) for admins and critical staff.
  - Implement role-based access controls to ensure functions and actions are limited only to appropriate administrators.

- **Threats mitigated:**
  - Severity: High - Unauthorized modifications or misuse of sensitive application configurations leading to security breach or downtime.

- **Impact:**
  Effectively mitigates risks from internal administration misuse or compromise and establishes clear accountability.

- **Currently implemented:**
  Explicit details of administration role configuration or access control mechanisms are lacking.

- **Missing implementation:**
  There is insufficient detail on current admin authentication or authorization model; further clarification and robust implementation required in the Web Control Plane.
