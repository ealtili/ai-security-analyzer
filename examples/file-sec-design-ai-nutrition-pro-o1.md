# BUSINESS POSTURE

- AI Nutrition-Pro aims to provide advanced AI-based nutrition content generation for Meal Planner applications.
- The primary goal is to generate revenue by integrating with multiple Meal Planner applications, offering them automated, high-quality dietary content.
- A secondary goal is to sustain a positive reputation by securely handling sensitive data (dietitian content, personal health data if any).
- The business strategy includes ensuring scalability to handle potentially high volumes of requests.
- Key business risks include potential reputational damage in the event of data breaches, compliance risks if sensitive health data is mishandled, scalability issues leading to service degradation, and cost overruns from external API usage (ChatGPT-3.5).

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls (from the file)
- security control: Authentication with Meal Planner applications via individual API keys.
- security control: Authorization of Meal Planner applications using ACL rules at the API Gateway.
- security control: Encrypted network traffic via TLS between Meal Planner and API Gateway as well as between internal components.

Accepted risks
- accepted risk: Reliance on OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT-3.5 for content generation, which may introduce external dependencies and potential data exposure if not configured properly.
- accepted risk: Data at rest in the database (if not encrypted) could be disclosed if the underlying infrastructure is compromised.

Recommended security controls (high priority, not explicitly mentioned in the file)
- security control: Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the API Gateway to help prevent common web vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
- security control: Perform input validation at the API Application layer (backend_api) to mitigate injection and malformed data risks.
- security control: Ensure encryption at rest for database instances (e.g., AWS RDS encryption).
- security control: Establish secrets management (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault) for API keys and database credentials.
- security control: Implement monitoring and logging (with real-time alerting) for anomaly detection and possible intrusion attempts.

Security requirements
- Authentication: The solution must authenticate every request from Meal Planner applications using unique API keys or other strong credential methods (e.g., JWT).
- Authorization: Fine-grained authorization rules managed centrally by the API Gateway and enforced by the backend services.
- Input validation: All inputs must be verified at both the API Gateway (where applicable) and the backend API to filter out malicious content.
- Cryptography:
  - All traffic in transit must be encrypted with TLS.
  - Data at rest in databases should be encrypted with AES-256 (or equivalent).
  - External API keys and secrets must be stored securely.

## DEPLOYMENT

Possible deployment solutions:
- AWS ECS Fargate for container orchestration
- AWS EKS (Kubernetes) or on-premises orchestrations
- Traditional VMs hosting Docker containers

Chosen deployment in detail (AWS ECS):
- Services are defined as ECS tasks, each running in its own container environment.
- Databases run on Amazon RDS with encryption at rest.
- Networking is handled via Application Load Balancer in front of the API Gateway.
- ChatGPT is accessed over public internet with secured TLS endpoints.

## BUILD

AI Nutrition-Pro uses a CI/CD pipeline to automate build and deployment:

1. Developers commit code to a code repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. The build system (e.g., GitHub Actions) is triggered.
3. Automated pipelines run unit tests, static application security testing (SAST), and linters.
4. Upon success, Docker images are built and pushed to a container registry (e.g., Amazon ECR).
5. ECS is updated with the new container images for each service (API Gateway, Web Control Plane, API Application).

Example build process diagram:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Dev(Developer) --> Repo(Code Repository)
    Repo --> BuildSystem(CI/CD Pipeline)
    BuildSystem --> SASTScanner(Static Security Scanner)
    SASTScanner --> BuildSystem
    BuildSystem --> DockerRegistry(Amazon ECR)
    DockerRegistry --> ECSDeployment(ECS Service Deployment)
```

Security controls of the build process:
- Automated SAST scanning to detect potential vulnerabilities in code.
- Automated linting and code testing.
- Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities.
- Signing of Docker images before pushing to the registry.
- Role-based access for pipeline stages to avoid tampering.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

What are the critical business processes we are trying to protect?
- Onboarding and billing for new clients (ensuring accurate invoicing and revenue protection).
- Generation and handling of nutrition data (ensuring content integrity and data privacy).

What data are we trying to protect, and what is their sensitivity?
- Client billing and account information: confidentiality must be maintained to protect financial data.
- Dietitian content samples and AI-generated responses: might contain sensitive health-related content.
- Access credentials and API keys: high sensitivity to prevent unauthorized system access.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
1. Are there any regulatory or compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA) for storing or processing dietitian content?
2. Do Meal Planner applications share personally identifiable health information (PII/PHI)?
3. How is usage of ChatGPT-3.5 billed and monitored to control costs?
4. Is a Web Application Firewall already part of the AWS stack or must it be newly implemented?

Assumptions:
1. TLS is enforced on all public endpoints and internal traffic where possible.
2. ChatGPT-3.5 usage is governed by OpenAIâ€™s standard agreements and usage policies.
3. API Gateway (Kong) will remain the single ingress point for external requests.
4. RDS instances will be encrypted by default, with limited inbound connectivity via security groups.
