Based on the provided project files, here are the mitigation strategies for the application:

- **Mitigation Strategy: Input Validation for API Keys and URLs**
  - **Description:** Implement input validation for API keys and URLs to ensure they follow expected patterns and are not malformed. Validate the length and format of API keys and URLs parameters before processing.
  - **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    - **SQL Injection**: Malformed or malicious input in API keys or URLs can lead to SQL injection attacks when input is directly used in backend queries.
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Malformed URLs or API keys could be used to inject malicious scripts, potentially exposing user data or performing actions on behalf of the user.
  - **Impact:** Reduces the risk of SQL injection and XSS attacks by ensuring input is properly sanitized.
  - **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented for some API keys in `backend/config.py`.
  - **Missing Implementation:** Missing in other parts of the codebase, especially in `backend\codegen\utils.py` and `backend\image_generation\core.py`.

- **Mitigation Strategy: Secure Environment Variables**
  - **Description:** Ensure environment variables containing sensitive information like API keys are securely. Do not expose these keys in error logs or debug prints. Use environment variable managers like `poetry` or `dotenv` to securely load these keys.
  - **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    - **Information Exposure**: Prevent unauthorized access to environment variables, which could potentially expose API keys.
  - **Impact:** Ensures that sensitive information is not leaked through logs or debug statements.
  - **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in `backend\config.py` and `backend\start.py`.
  - **Missing Implementation:** Missing in `backend\evals\runner.py` and `backend\image_generation\core.py`.

- **Mitigation Strategy: Secure URL Handling**
  - **Description:** Validate and sanitize URLs before processing, especially when used in external API calls or serving content. Ensure that URLs are not malformed or maliciously crafted.
  - **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    - **URL Injection**: Malformed URLs could be used to redirect to malicious sites or perform unauthorized actions.
  - **Impact:** Reduces the risk of URL injection attacks by ensuring URLs are validated.
  - **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in `backend\image_generation\core.py` and `backend\image_processing\utils.py`.
  - **Missing Implementation:** Missing in `backend\evals\runner.py` and `backend\codegen\test_utils.py`.

- **Mitigation Strategy: Secure External Dependencies**
  - **Description:** Ensure that all external dependencies and libraries (e.g., Tailwind, jQuery) are securely and up-to date. Validate their integrity and security patches.
  - **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    - **Third-Party Library Vulnerabilities**: Insecure or out-of-date libraries can introduce vulnerabilities.
  - **Impact:** Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities from insecure or outdated libraries.
  - **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented with checks in `backend\prompts\__init__.py`.
  - **Missing Implementation:** Missing in `backend\codegen\utils.py` and `backend\image_generation\core.py`.

- **Mitigation Strategy: Secure Image and Data URL Generation**
  - **Description:** Ensure that image and data URL generation processes are secure and cannot be leveraged for malicious purposes. Validate the content and size of images/data URLs.
  - **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    - **Data URL Injection**: Malformed data URLs can be used to inject malicious content.
  - **Impact:** Reduces the risk of data URL injection and ensures secure data URL generation.
  - **rently Implemented:** Partially implemented in `backend\image_generation\core.py`.
  - **Missing Implementation:** Missing in `backend\image_process\utils.py`.

- **Mitigation Strategy: Secure WebSocket Communication**
  - **Description:** Ensure secure handling of WebSocket communication in `routes\generate_code.py`. Validate and sanitize all input and output data to prevent injection attacks.
  - **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    - **WebSocket Attacks**: Malformed WebSocket input can be leveraged for injection attacks.
  - **Impact:** Reduces the risk of WebSocket-based attacks by ensuring secure handling of WebSocket communication.
