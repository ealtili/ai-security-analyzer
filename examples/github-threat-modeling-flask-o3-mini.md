Below is a threat model focused on risks introduced specifically by Flask’s components. Note that common web application threats (such as standard injection attacks, CSRF, etc.) are omitted since the focus is on Flask-specific behaviors.

- **Threat:** Exposure of Debug Mode and Interactive Debugger
  - **Description:** When an application is deployed with Flask’s debug mode enabled, the built‐in Werkzeug interactive debugger becomes accessible. An attacker who reaches the debugger interface could execute arbitrary Python code, inspect the stack, or even spawn a shell. This risk is particularly acute if the debugger is available over the network in a production setting.
  - **Impact:** Full system compromise including arbitrary code execution and leakage of sensitive application internals.
  - **Affected Flask Component:** Debugger middleware integrated via Flask’s development server (based on Werkzeug).
  - **Risk Severity:** Critical
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Always disable debug mode in production by setting `DEBUG=False`.
    - Use environment-specific configuration files to prevent accidental deployment of development settings.
    - Limit network exposure of administrative endpoints with firewalls or reverse proxies.

- **Threat:** Insecure Client-Side Session Management
  - **Description:** By default, Flask stores session data in client-side cookies signed with a secret key. If this key is weak, guessable, or accidentally disclosed, an attacker might forge or tamper with session cookies, thereby impersonating users or escalating privileges.
  - **Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access, and potential privilege escalation through manipulation of client data.
  - **Affected Flask Component:** `SecureCookieSessionInterface` from the `flask.sessions` module.
  - **Risk Severity:** Critical
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Generate a strong, high-entropy secret key and keep it confidential.
    - Regularly rotate secret keys as part of a robust security policy.
    - Consider using server-side session storage mechanisms when confidentiality of session data is a high priority.

- **Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
  - **Description:** Flask integrates the Jinja2 templating engine to render dynamic content. Developers who insert unsanitized user input into templates (or allow it to influence template context) risk introducing SSTI vulnerabilities. An attacker exploiting such a vulnerability may insert malicious template code to execute arbitrary Python code on the server.
  - **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, and potential control over the underlying system.
  - **Affected Flask Component:** Jinja2 templating engine used within Flask for rendering views.
  - **Risk Severity:** Critical
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Do not pass raw, untrusted input directly to templates without proper validation and sanitization.
    - Leverage Jinja2’s autoescaping features to mitigate injection risks.
    - Apply a strict separation between user-controlled data and template code.

- **Threat:** Insecure Static File Serving in Production
  - **Description:** Flask’s built-in mechanism for serving static files is optimized for development and may lack the robust access controls required in a production environment. Misconfiguration might lead to exposure of sensitive files or directories, including configuration files or internal documentation.
  - **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential mapping of application internals, and unintended exposure of sensitive assets.
  - **Affected Flask Component:** Flask’s static file serving functionality, provided via the underlying Werkzeug server.
  - **Risk Severity:** Medium
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Delegate static file serving to specialized and hardened web servers (like Nginx or Apache) in production environments.
    - Carefully configure file permissions and route definitions to ensure that only intended assets are accessible.
    - Audit the directories referenced by Flask’s static file settings to prevent accidental inclusion of sensitive files.

This threat model is intended to help development teams understand and address security concerns that are tightly coupled to using Flask’s built-in components and default configurations.
