Below is a threat model focused solely on risks that stem from Flask’s own design and components. Each threat entry includes the threat name, a description of how an attacker might abuse the component, the impact on the application, which Flask component is affected, the risk severity, and suggested mitigation strategies.

- Debug Mode Exposure
  - Description: If the Flask application is inadvertently deployed with debug mode enabled, Flask’s integrated Werkzeug debugger becomes accessible. An attacker who can trigger an error may reach the interactive debugger console and execute arbitrary Python code or inspect internal state and configuration.
  - Impact: Remote code execution, full system compromise, and disclosure of sensitive configuration details.
  - Affected Flask Component: Flask’s debug mode configuration and the built-in Werkzeug debugger.
  - Risk Severity: Critical
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Ensure the application is never run in debug mode in production.
    - Set the environment (FLASK_ENV) to “production” to disable the debugger.
    - Rigorously validate deployment configurations to prevent accidental exposure of debug settings.

- Insecure Session Cookie Handling
  - Description: Flask’s default use of client-side sessions relies on signed cookies using a secret key. If this key is weak, hardcoded, or inadvertently committed to source control, an attacker may be able to forge or manipulate session cookies—potentially impersonating other users or elevating privileges.
  - Impact: Unauthorized access, impersonation, and potential privilege escalation within the application.
  - Affected Flask Component: Flask’s session management system (specifically the secure cookie signing routines).
  - Risk Severity: High
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Generate a strong, cryptographically random secret key.
    - Keep secret keys out of source code repositories and manage them securely (e.g., via environment variables).
    - Rotate keys periodically and ensure that production keys differ from default or development values.

- Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Jinja2 Templates
  - Description: Flask uses Jinja2 as its default templating engine. If user-supplied input is embedded in templates without proper sanitization or autoescaping, attackers might inject malicious Jinja2 expressions. This can lead to code execution within the template rendering context.
  - Impact: Remote code execution, leakage of sensitive data, and overall compromise of the web application.
  - Affected Flask Component: Template rendering functions (e.g., render_template) that integrate with Jinja2.
  - Risk Severity: High
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Rely on Jinja2’s autoescaping features (which are enabled by default for HTML templates) and avoid disabling them unnecessarily.
    - Never directly embed untrusted input into templates; instead, validate and sanitize all user inputs used in the view context.
    - Use safe patterns for dynamic content insertion to avoid inadvertent execution of unintended template code.

- Misconfigured Static File Serving
  - Description: Flask provides a built-in mechanism for serving static files directly from a configured folder. If the static folder is misconfigured or contains sensitive files (such as configuration files or backup archives), an attacker may be able to access these files by simply navigating to predictable routes.
  - Impact: Disclosure of sensitive information, which could lead to further compromise of the application or environment.
  - Affected Flask Component: The static file serving mechanism (i.e., the built-in routing for serving files from /static or a custom-defined static URL path).
  - Risk Severity: Medium
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Carefully configure the static directory to ensure only intended public assets are included.
    - Regularly audit the contents of the static folder to remove any files that should remain private.
    - In production, consider offloading static file serving to a dedicated, hardened web server.

- Insecure Use of File Serving Functions (send_file/send_from_directory)
  - Description: Flask offers utility functions such as send_file and send_from_directory to serve files over HTTP. If these functions are called with user-controllable input (for example, a filename taken directly from a URL parameter) without proper sanitization, an attacker may craft paths that bypass directory restrictions, leading to unauthorized file access (directory traversal).
  - Impact: Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive files stored on the server, potentially exposing credentials or internal configuration.
  - Affected Flask Component: File-serving functions (send_file, send_from_directory) and their associated internal path-joining utilities like safe_join.
  - Risk Severity: Medium
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Avoid passing untrusted user input directly into file-serving functions.
    - Use Flask’s built-in utility (e.g., safe_join) to securely combine file paths and enforce directory boundaries.
    - Implement strict input validation to ensure only allowed filenames or file types are accepted.

This focused threat model highlights the realistic Flask-specific risks—centered on default configuration options and built-in components—that developers must defend against when using the framework.
