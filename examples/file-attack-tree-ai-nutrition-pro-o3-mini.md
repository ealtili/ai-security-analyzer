# 1. Understand the Project

**Project Name:** AI Nutrition‑Pro

**Overview:**
AI Nutrition‑Pro is an AI‐enabled application built to generate dietetic content and manage client configurations. It exposes functionalities via REST APIs and integrates with external systems (e.g., Meal Planner applications) and ChatGPT‑3.5 for LLM‑assisted content generation. The application is architected using containerized services and deployed on AWS (Elastic Container Service and Amazon RDS) with Kong as the API Gateway.

**Key Components & Features:**
- **API Gateway (Kong):**
  - Authenticates external requests (via API keys)
  - Enforces filtering and rate limiting
- **API Application:**
  - Written in Golang; deployed as a container
  - Implements the core AI content generation functionality
  - Communicates with ChatGPT‑3.5 over HTTPS/REST
  - Persists request/response and dietitian content samples in the API Database
- **Web Control Plane:**
  - Written in Golang; provides administrative functions (client onboarding, billing configuration, etc.)
  - Uses the Control Plane Database to store system data
- **Databases (Amazon RDS):**
  - **Control Plane Database:** Stores configuration, tenant, and billing data
  - **API Database:** Stores dietitian content samples and API interaction data
- **External Systems & Persons:**
  - **Meal Planner Applications:** Integrate using HTTPS/REST to upload samples and fetch AI-generated diet content
  - **ChatGPT‑3.5:** External LLM used by the API Application to generate content
  - **Administrator:** Manages system configuration and resolves issues

**Security Measures Noted:**
- Authentication and authorization via API keys and ACL rules enforced by the API Gateway
- TLS‑encrypted network traffic for both external and internal communications

# 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

### High‑Risk Paths & Critical Nodes
- **API Gateway Exploitation (Node 1):**
  A successful bypass via misconfiguration or API key compromise grants an attacker a direct pathway into backend systems.

- **API Application Vulnerabilities (Node 2):**
  Exploitation of coding flaws (e.g., injection attacks) could lead to full database compromise and manipulation of AI‑generated content.

- **Web Control Plane Attacks (Node 3):**
  Gaining control of the administrative interface can allow an attacker to modify configurations and disable security measures, impacting all integrated components.

Given the central role of these components, efforts to secure API key management, input validation, and strict access controls in the Web Control Plane are critical.

---

# 8. Mitigation Strategies

For each identified threat, recommended controls include:

- **For API Gateway Attacks:**
  - Rigorously review Kong’s configuration for input validation, ACL rules, and rate limiting.
  - Enforce strict API key management and consider mechanisms such as key rotation and per‑request logging.

- **For API Application Vulnerabilities:**
  - Implement comprehensive input validation and parameterized queries to mitigate injection attacks.
  - Harden error handling to prevent leaking sensitive information.
  - Regularly scan and update container images and deployment configurations.

- **For Web Control Plane Attacks:**
  - Strengthen administrator authentication measures including strong password policies and multi‑factor authentication.
  - Audit role‑based access controls and verify that configurations cannot be bypassed.
  - Monitor access logs for anomalous behavior and establish session integrity checks.

- **For Inter‑Component Communications:**
  - Ensure robust TLS configurations with strict certificate validation on all endpoints.
  - Regularly test for downgrade attacks or misconfigurations in TLS settings.
  - Validate data exchanged with external systems using strict schema validations.

---

# 9. Summary of Findings

### Key Risks Identified
- **Exploitation of API Gateway misconfigurations or API key weaknesses** is a major risk, as it serves as the entry point for external integrations.
- **Vulnerabilities in the API Application,** especially in input handling, could lead to database compromise and data manipulation.
- **Weaknesses in the Web Control Plane,** if exploited through poor access control or weak authentication, could allow full administrative control.
- **Potential misconfigurations in TLS or inter‑component integrations** may offer low‑probability but high‑impact attack vectors.

### Recommended Actions
- **Review and Harden Configurations:** Audit API Gateway policies, access controls, and container deployment settings.
- **Implement Strong Input Validation:** Use best practices in coding to prevent injection vulnerabilities in both API Application and Web Control Plane.
- **Improve Key and Credential Management:** Secure API keys and administrator credentials with enforced policies.
- **Ensure Robust Network Security:** Double‑check TLS configurations and monitor inter‑component communications for anomalies.

---

# 10. Questions & Assumptions

- **Assumptions:**
  - TLS is assumed to be correctly implemented; however, the possibility of misconfiguration is factored into the threat model.
  - The analysis focuses on vulnerabilities introduced by the architecture and component integrations as described in the FILE—not on external generic threats.
  - It is assumed that the Golang-based components do not have additional hidden vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated dependencies) unless specified.

- **Questions:**
  - Are there any specific application-level security controls (beyond the described API key and ACL enforcement) that have been implemented in production?
  - Is there an independent security audit conducted on the container configurations and AWS IAM policies related to deployment?
  - How are API keys generated, stored, and rotated—could that process be a likely target for attackers?
