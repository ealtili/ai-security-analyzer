# Attack Surface Analysis: AI Nutrition-Pro

## Critical Attack Surfaces

### 1. Administrative Access Control

- **Description**: The application has an administrative interface for system configuration that could be compromised.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: Administrators access the Web Control Plane to manage system configuration, onboard clients, and handle billing data.

- **Example**: Attackers gaining administrative access could modify system configurations, access client data, or disrupt service.

- **Impact**: Complete system compromise, unauthorized access to all client data, service disruption, or malicious configuration changes.

- **Risk Severity**: Critical

- **Current Mitigations**: The architecture doesn't specify authentication mechanisms for administrative access beyond basic authentication.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Implement multi-factor authentication for admin accounts
  - Establish privileged access management controls
  - Create comprehensive audit logging for administrative actions
  - Implement session timeout and management
  - Develop detailed role-based access controls

## High Attack Surfaces

### 2. LLM Prompt Injection

- **Description**: Vulnerabilities where malicious input can manipulate the ChatGPT-3.5 LLM to perform unintended actions.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: The system takes content from Meal Planner applications and forwards it to ChatGPT.

- **Example**: An attacker could inject prompts that instruct the LLM to ignore safety controls, generate harmful nutrition advice, or attempt to extract information.

- **Impact**: Generation of inappropriate or harmful nutritional content, service manipulation, or exposure of system information.

- **Risk Severity**: High

- **Current Mitigations**: API Gateway performs input filtering, but specific LLM prompt sanitization isn't detailed.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Implement LLM-specific input sanitization
  - Create a robust prompt engineering framework with guardrails
  - Establish content validation and review processes
  - Deploy output filtering for generated content
  - Design prompt templates that resist manipulation

### 3. API Gateway Security

- **Description**: The API Gateway is the primary entry point for external applications and controls authentication.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: Uses Kong API Gateway to handle all external requests, authentication, and rate limiting.

- **Example**: API key theft, authentication bypass attempts, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the gateway's filtering mechanisms.

- **Impact**: Unauthorized system access, potential data breaches, or service abuse.

- **Risk Severity**: High

- **Current Mitigations**: Authentication with API keys, ACL rules, and input filtering.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Implement API key rotation mechanisms
  - Add IP allowlisting for registered clients
  - Deploy advanced request validation and sanitization
  - Establish more comprehensive logging of authentication failures
  - Create proactive monitoring for suspicious access patterns

### 4. Multi-tenancy Data Isolation

- **Description**: Risk of cross-tenant data access when multiple Meal Planner applications share the system.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: Stores data from different clients in shared databases (Control Plane Database and API Database).

- **Example**: A vulnerability could allow one Meal Planner application to access another client's dietitian content or user data.

- **Impact**: Data privacy violations, breach of client trust, potential regulatory compliance issues.

- **Risk Severity**: High

- **Current Mitigations**: Basic ACL rules in the API Gateway, but specific tenant isolation mechanisms aren't detailed.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Implement strong logical data separation in databases
  - Add tenant-specific encryption
  - Create strict access controls at application and database levels
  - Design comprehensive data access audit trails
  - Establish data segregation testing procedures

### 5. Sensitive Health Information Handling

- **Description**: The system likely processes health and nutrition data that may be subject to regulatory requirements.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: Stores and processes dietitians' content with potential personal health information before sending to external LLM.

- **Example**: Personal health data being exposed in transit or stored without proper protections, or sent to OpenAI without appropriate safeguards.

- **Impact**: Privacy violations, regulatory non-compliance (potential HIPAA or GDPR violations), reputational damage.

- **Risk Severity**: High

- **Current Mitigations**: TLS encryption for data in transit, but no specific data handling policies mentioned.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Implement data anonymization before LLM submission
  - Establish clear policies on handling health information
  - Deploy field-level encryption for sensitive data
  - Create proper consent mechanisms for data processing
  - Develop compliance framework for health data handling

## Medium Attack Surfaces

### 6. External LLM Service Dependency

- **Description**: Reliance on ChatGPT-3.5 creates dependencies and security considerations when sharing data with external services.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: Sends requests to OpenAI's API and processes responses as a core part of its functionality.

- **Example**: OpenAI service outage, API changes, or data handling policy changes affecting the application's functionality or security posture.

- **Impact**: Service disruption, potential data privacy issues, or unexpected content generation.

- **Risk Severity**: Medium

- **Current Mitigations**: TLS encryption for API communication.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Implement secure API key management for OpenAI access
  - Create fallback mechanisms for API outages
  - Design content validation for LLM responses
  - Establish clear data sharing agreements with OpenAI
  - Develop alternative LLM provider options

### 7. Container and Cloud Infrastructure Security

- **Description**: Security of the container and cloud infrastructure underlying the application.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: Deploys components as Docker containers in AWS ECS with connected AWS RDS databases.

- **Example**: Container vulnerabilities, cloud misconfiguration, inadequate IAM policies, or insufficient network segmentation.

- **Impact**: System compromise, unauthorized data access, or service disruption.

- **Risk Severity**: Medium

- **Current Mitigations**: Uses managed AWS services which provide some security features by default.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Implement container vulnerability scanning
  - Create secure infrastructure-as-code templates
  - Establish proper network segmentation
  - Deploy cloud security posture management
  - Design least-privilege IAM policies

### 8. Rate Limiting and Resource Exhaustion

- **Description**: Potential for system resource depletion through excessive API calls.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: Processes potentially resource-intensive LLM operations through its API.

- **Example**: Malicious or malfunctioning clients making excessive requests that overwhelm system resources or generate excessive costs.

- **Impact**: Service degradation, denial of service for legitimate users, or unexpected billing costs.

- **Risk Severity**: Medium

- **Current Mitigations**: Basic rate limiting at the API Gateway level.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Implement client-specific usage quotas
  - Create more granular rate limiting policies
  - Design cost control mechanisms for LLM API usage
  - Establish anomaly detection for unusual usage patterns
  - Deploy resource utilization monitoring with alerts
