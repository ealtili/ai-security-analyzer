# AI Nutrition-Pro: Attack Surface Analysis

## 1. LLM Prompt Injection Attacks

- **Description**: Attackers could manipulate the input to ChatGPT-3.5 to bypass constraints or generate harmful content.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: The application passes dietitians' content to ChatGPT-3.5 for AI-generated nutrition content without clear validation mechanisms.

- **Example**: A malicious actor could embed instructions in the dietitian samples that direct ChatGPT to generate harmful or inappropriate dietary advice.

- **Impact**: Generation of potentially harmful nutrition advice that could lead to health risks for end users, reputational damage, and liability issues.

- **Risk Severity**: Critical

- **Current Mitigations**: Input filtering at API Gateway level is mentioned, but it's unclear if this is specifically designed to prevent LLM prompt injection.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  * LLM-specific input sanitization
  * Implementation of prompt engineering safeguards
  * Output validation before returning generated content
  * Content moderation layer that reviews generated advice
  * Prompt templates with strong guardrails

## 2. API Gateway Security Vulnerabilities

- **Description**: The Kong API Gateway is the primary entry point for external applications and could be targeted for various attacks.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: Exposes services through REST APIs to third-party Meal Planner applications.

- **Example**: Attackers could attempt credential stuffing against API keys, DoS attacks, or exploit vulnerabilities in Kong's implementation.

- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to backend services, data breaches, or service disruption.

- **Risk Severity**: High

- **Current Mitigations**: Authentication with API keys, rate limiting, input filtering, and TLS encryption for network traffic.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  * IP allowlisting for trusted Meal Planner applications
  * API request logging and anomaly detection
  * Regular vulnerability scanning of the API Gateway
  * More sophisticated rate limiting based on user behavior patterns

## 3. Cross-Tenant Data Leakage

- **Description**: In a multi-tenant environment, improper access controls could lead to one tenant accessing another's data.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: System design allows multiple Meal Planner applications to store and retrieve dietitian content samples.

- **Example**: A vulnerability in authorization logic could allow one Meal Planner application to access another's proprietary content or user data.

- **Impact**: Exposure of confidential content, competitive disadvantage, privacy violations.

- **Risk Severity**: High

- **Current Mitigations**: Authentication with unique API keys per application and ACL rules in API Gateway.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  * Strong tenant isolation in database design
  * Robust data access controls with tenant context validation
  * Comprehensive audit logging of cross-tenant access attempts
  * Regular access control reviews and penetration testing

## 4. Database Exploitation

- **Description**: Attackers could target database vulnerabilities to extract sensitive information.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: Stores valuable data including dietitians' content samples and LLM interactions in RDS instances.

- **Example**: SQL injection or other database attacks could expose dietitians' proprietary content.

- **Impact**: Intellectual property theft, privacy violations, reputation damage.

- **Risk Severity**: High

- **Current Mitigations**: TLS for database connections, internal-only database exposure.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  * Database encryption at rest
  * Parameterized queries/ORM to prevent SQL injection
  * Database activity monitoring
  * Least privilege database access principles

## 5. Control Plane Privilege Escalation

- **Description**: The Web Control Plane for administration could be vulnerable to privilege escalation.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: Provides multiple roles with varying levels of access to configure and manage the system.

- **Example**: A user with App Onboarding Manager role exploits a vulnerability to gain Administrator privileges.

- **Impact**: Unauthorized system configuration changes, access to sensitive tenant data, potential for system compromise.

- **Risk Severity**: High

- **Current Mitigations**: Role-based access control is mentioned but details are limited.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  * Multi-factor authentication for administrative access
  * Comprehensive audit logging of control plane actions
  * Regular privilege reviews and access recertification
  * Strict separation of duties between roles

## 6. LLM Service Dependency Risk

- **Description**: Heavy reliance on ChatGPT-3.5 creates operational and security risks if the service is compromised or unavailable.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: Core content generation functionality depends entirely on OpenAI's services.

- **Example**: ChatGPT service changes its API, experiences extended downtime, or has a security breach.

- **Impact**: Service disruption, inconsistent content generation, potential exposure of sensitive prompts.

- **Risk Severity**: Medium

- **Current Mitigations**: None explicitly mentioned.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  * Fallback content generation mechanisms
  * Content caching where appropriate
  * Monitoring of API changes and service health
  * Exploration of alternative LLM providers

## 7. Content Poisoning

- **Description**: The system that stores and uses dietitians' content samples could be subject to gradual malicious manipulation.

- **How AI Nutrition-Pro contributes**: Allows storage of content samples that influence AI generation without apparent review.

- **Example**: Gradual introduction of subtly biased or harmful nutrition guidance that influences future AI content generation.

- **Impact**: Degradation of content quality, potential for harmful nutrition advice, reputational damage.

- **Risk Severity**: Medium

- **Current Mitigations**: Authentication controls on who can upload content samples.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  * Content review process before samples are used for AI training
  * Anomaly detection for unusual content patterns
  * Regular auditing of stored content samples
  * Version control and change tracking for content samples
