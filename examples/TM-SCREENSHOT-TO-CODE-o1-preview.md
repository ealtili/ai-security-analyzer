2. **Frontend to Backend**: Data transmission between frontend and backend components.
3. **Backend to External AI APIs**: Communication with external AI services crosses organizational boundaries.
4. **External AI APIs to Backend**: Responses from AI services may contain untrusted data.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- **Questions**:
  - *Are API keys provided by users stored or only used transiently during requests?*
  - *Is there any user authentication mechanism in place for the application?*
  - *How are user-uploaded images handled—are they stored persistently or processed in memory?*
  - *Does the application sanitize or validate the generated code before sending it to users?*
  - *Are there any automated security checks (e.g., SAST, dependency scanning) integrated into the build process?*
  - *What logging mechanisms are in place, and do logs ever include sensitive user data?*

- **Assumptions**:
  - The application does not implement user authentication; it is accessible to all users.
  - API keys are provided by users through the frontend and used transiently in the backend without persistent storage.
  - User-uploaded images are processed in memory and not stored on the server.
  - All communications between components (frontend, backend, external APIs) are secured using HTTPS/TLS.
  - The build process currently does not include automated security scanning tools.
  - The application does not perform sanitization or validation of the generated code before displaying it to users.
