Use Docker security options like user namespaces, seccomp, and AppArmor profiles. Keep container runtime and images up to date with security patches.                 | Low likelihood if containers are configured securely.

| 0005      | Docker Images         | Use of Unverified Base Images Leading to Vulnerabilities               | Dockerfiles use base images pulled from public repositories without explicit verification, which may contain vulnerabilities or malicious code.                                                             | No mention of verifying base images or using trusted sources.

| 0001      | Dependency Management | Use of Untrusted Dependencies Leading to Supply Chain Attacks          | The project relies on multiple third-party packages from PyPI and npm. Malicious actors might publish compromised packages or typosquatting packages with similar names to common dependencies.          | No mention of dependency auditing, integrity verification, or use of tools to protect against such attacks. Dependency files like `poetry.lock` and `package.json` specify versions but do not guarantee integrity.                                               | Use tools like `pip hash` and lock files with hash verification to ensure package integrity. Configure npm and pip to only install packages from trusted registries. Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk or Dependabot. | Medium likelihood due to increasing prevalence of supply chain attacks on package repositories and potential for developers to accidentally include untrusted packages.                                                          | High impact as compromised dependencies can introduce malicious code into the application, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or control of the application by attackers.                                | High          |
| 0002      | Build Scripts        | Malicious Code Injection via Build Scripts                             | Build scripts and Dockerfiles may be modified to include malicious commands or configurations, especially if unauthorized individuals can access or alter them.                                            | No mention of code signing, integrity checks, or access controls for build scripts.

| 0003      | Build Environment    | Compromise of Build System Leading to Tampered Artifacts                | If the build environment (e.g., CI/CD pipeline, build servers) is not secured, attackers could inject malicious code into the build artifacts without detection.                                          | No specific details on securing the build environment or monitoring for unauthorized changes. If builds are performed on developer machines, risks include local compromise affecting builds.                                                                       | Secure the build environment with strong authentication, access controls, and network security measures. Use dedicated build servers with limited access. Implement monitoring and auditing of build processes and artifacts.                                    | Medium likelihood if build environments are not properly secured, especially in open-source projects or where builds occur on multiple developer machines.                                                                     | High impact as tampered build artifacts can introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors into the application, affecting all users and undermining trust in the software.                                                            | High          |
| 0004      | Automated Security Checks | Vulnerabilities Not Detected During Build                             | The absence of automated security tools in the build process can lead to vulnerabilities going unnoticed, such as outdated dependencies or insecure code patterns.                                         | No mention of integrating Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools, dependency scanners, or linters in the build process to detect potential security issues automatically.                                                                                | Integrate security tools like SAST scanners (e.g., Bandit for Python, ESLint with security plugins for JavaScript), dependency vulnerability scanners (e.g., Safety, npm audit), and linters into the build pipeline. Enforce policies to address identified issues. | High likelihood as vulnerabilities can remain undetected without automated checks, relying solely on manual review and oversight.                                                                                              | Medium impact as undiscovered vulnerabilities can be exploited in production, leading to security incidents, data breaches, and erosion of user trust.                                                                           | High          |
| 0005      | API Keys in Build Environment | Exposure of API Keys During Build Process                              | API keys and secrets may be used during builds for testing or deployment and risk exposure if not handled securely, especially if build logs or configurations leak.                                      | No mention of secret management practices for the build environment. API keys might be stored in environment variables or configuration files without proper access controls or masking in logs.                                                                   | Use secure secrets management solutions to handle API keys during builds (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). Ensure build logs do not print sensitive information. Limit access to secrets and rotate keys regularly.                                | Medium likelihood if best practices for secret management are not enforced in the build process, increasing the risk of accidental exposure.                                                                                  | High impact as exposed API keys can lead to unauthorized access to external services, potentially resulting in data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage for the organization.                                     | High          |

10. How are dependencies reviewed and maintained to ensure they are free from vulnerabilities or malicious code?

**Assumptions:**

- The application does not handle user authentication and does not manage user accounts.
- No persistent data storage is used by the application; all processing is done in-memory or transiently.
- The build and deployment processes are manual unless specified; no CI/CD pipelines are currently in use.
- API keys and secrets are stored in environment variables and are managed manually without a secrets management solution.
- Developers may not have formal security training or policies guiding secure coding and development practices.
- Docker containers are configured with default settings and may not follow container security best practices.
- The application does not currently implement automated security scans or code analysis during the build process.
- External dependencies are updated as needed but may not be regularly audited for security vulnerabilities.
- The hosted version uses similar configurations to the open-source project unless otherwise specified.
- Logging is minimal, and no specific measures are in place to prevent sensitive data from being included in logs.

Note: The threats identified prioritize realistic risks based on the provided project files and aim to highlight areas where security measures can be improved to protect against potential threats. Mitigations are suggested to address these threats in the context of the application's architecture and operational environment.
