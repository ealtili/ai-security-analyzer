# APPLICATION THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS

- **User-Provided Images and Designs**: Screenshots, mockups, and Figma designs uploaded by users for conversion to code.
- **API Keys**: Sensitive API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Replicate used to access AI models.
- **Generated Code**: Code output generated by AI models based on user inputs.
- **User Data**: Version history and preferences stored on the client-side.
- **Application Code and Configurations**: Source code, scripts, and configuration files of the application.
- **Credentials in Environment Variables**: Sensitive credentials stored in environment variables on the backend server.
- **Access to AI Models**: Permissions and access levels to external AI services like GPT-4 and Claude.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES

- **User Client to Frontend Application**: Boundary between the user's browser and the frontend application.
- **Frontend to Backend**: Communication between the frontend (React/Vite) and the backend (FastAPI).
- **Backend to External AI APIs**: Interactions between the backend and external AI services like OpenAI and Anthropic.
- **Backend to Image Generation Services**: Communication with image generation services like Replicate.
- **Backend to Data Storage**: Access to any databases or storage services used by the application.
- **Application to Third-Party APIs**: Interactions with services like `screenshotone.com` for screenshot capturing.
- **Environment Variables to Application Code**: Access to sensitive credentials stored in environment variables by the application code.

## DATA FLOWS

1. **User Uploads Image**: User uploads an image via the frontend application (Crosses User Client to Frontend Application boundary).
2. **Frontend Sends Image to Backend**: The image is sent from the frontend to the backend API for processing (Crosses Frontend to Backend boundary).
3. **Backend Sends Image to AI API**: Backend processes the image and sends it to external AI APIs (Crosses Backend to External AI APIs boundary).
4. **AI API Returns Generated Code**: External AI API returns the generated code to the backend (Crosses External AI APIs to Backend boundary).
5. **Backend Sends Code to Frontend**: Generated code is sent from the backend to the frontend (Crosses Backend to Frontend boundary).
6. **Frontend Displays Code to User**: Frontend application displays the generated code to the user (Crosses Frontend Application to User Client boundary).
7. **Backend Reads API Keys**: Backend reads API keys from environment variables (Within Backend component).
8. **Backend Calls Image Generation Services**: Backend may call external image generation services (Crosses Backend to Image Generation Services boundary).
9. **User Interacts with Version History**: User's version history is managed on the client-side (Within User Client component).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- **Questions**:
  - Are there any authentication mechanisms in place for user access to the frontend application?
  - Is there a database or persistent storage used by the application, and how is it secured?
  - How are API keys and secrets managed, rotated, and secured in the deployment environment?
  - What logging and monitoring solutions are implemented, and do they include security incident detection?
  - Are there any third-party integrations not mentioned in the project files that need to be considered?
  - Is user data subject to any regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)?

- **Assumptions**:
  - The application does not implement user authentication and is publicly accessible.
  - API keys are stored in environment variables but not encrypted or managed via a secrets management system.
  - The deployment environment is assumed to be a cloud-based infrastructure with standard security configurations.
  - No additional security measures like Web Application Firewalls (WAF) or Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are in place.
  - Developers have direct access to the source code repository and deployment pipelines without enforced multi-factor authentication.
  - Regular security updates and patches are not automated.

The above threat models aim to identify and prioritize potential security risks associated with the application, deployment, and build processes. Mitigations are provided to address these threats based on best practices and the information available from the project files.
