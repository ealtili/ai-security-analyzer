# Threat Model Analysis for pallets/flask

## Threat: [Secret Key Compromise](./threats/secret_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains the Flask application's `SECRET_KEY` through various means, such as:
    *   Finding it hardcoded in version-controlled source code.
    *   Accessing an improperly secured configuration file.
    *   Exploiting a server vulnerability to read environment variables.
    *   Social engineering an administrator.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can forge valid session cookies, impersonating any user (including administrators) and gaining unauthorized access to their accounts and data.
    *   **Data Tampering:** If the `SECRET_KEY` is misused for other cryptographic purposes, the attacker can modify data protected by it.
    *   **Extension Compromise:** Security features of Flask extensions relying on the `SECRET_KEY` (e.g., Flask-Login, Flask-Security) are bypassed.
*   **Flask Component Affected:**
    *   `app.secret_key` (Flask application configuration)
    *   `flask.session` (Session management)
    *   Potentially any Flask extension that uses `app.secret_key` (e.g., `flask_login`, `flask_security`)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Key Generation:** Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (e.g., `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` in Python) to create a long (at least 32 bytes), complex key.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Store the `SECRET_KEY` *exclusively* in an environment variable, *never* in source code or configuration files committed to version control.
    *   **Key Rotation:** Implement a regular key rotation process (e.g., using a key management service or a scheduled script) to limit the impact of a potential compromise.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the Flask application with the minimum necessary operating system privileges to limit the attacker's capabilities if they gain code execution.
    *   **Secure Configuration Files:** If configuration files are used, ensure they have restricted permissions (read-only by the application user) and are not web-accessible.

## Threat: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./threats/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker accesses the Flask application running in a production environment with debug mode enabled (`app.debug = True` or `FLASK_DEBUG=1`).  The attacker triggers an error or intentionally crafts requests to expose debugging information.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Detailed error messages, including stack traces, source code snippets, and potentially sensitive environment variables, are displayed to the attacker. This provides valuable reconnaissance information.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The Werkzeug debugger, active in debug mode, allows the attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the server if they can trigger an exception. This is a *critical* vulnerability.
*   **Flask Component Affected:**
    *   `app.debug` (Flask application configuration)
    *   `werkzeug.debug.DebuggedApplication` (Werkzeug debugger)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Configuration Control:** Ensure `app.debug` is set to `False` and `FLASK_DEBUG` is unset (or set to `0`) in *all* production environment configurations.
    *   **Separate Configuration Files:** Use distinct configuration files for development, testing, and production environments.
    *   **Automated Deployment Checks:** Implement checks in the deployment pipeline (e.g., CI/CD) to prevent deployment if debug mode is detected.
    *   **Environment Variable Verification:** Add checks within the application code to explicitly verify that `FLASK_DEBUG` is not enabled in production.

## Threat: [Unsafe File Access via `send_file` and `send_from_directory`](./threats/unsafe_file_access_via__send_file__and__send_from_directory_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious file paths, often using directory traversal techniques (`../`), to access files outside the intended directory when the application uses `send_file` or `send_from_directory` without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Directory Traversal:** The attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including configuration files containing secrets, source code, or sensitive system files.
*   **Flask Component Affected:**
    *   `flask.send_file`
    *   `flask.send_from_directory`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Path Sanitization:** *Always* sanitize user-provided file paths.  Use `os.path.abspath` and `os.path.join` to construct absolute paths and ensure they are within the intended directory.  *Never* directly concatenate user input with a base path.  Validate that the resulting path starts with the expected base directory.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Files/Extensions:** If possible, maintain a whitelist of allowed files or file extensions, rather than relying solely on path sanitization.
    *   **Prefer `send_file`:** When serving a single, known file, use `send_file` with a hardcoded, safe path instead of `send_from_directory`.
    *   **Chroot/Containerization:** Run the application within a chroot jail or container to limit the scope of accessible files, even if a directory traversal vulnerability is exploited.
