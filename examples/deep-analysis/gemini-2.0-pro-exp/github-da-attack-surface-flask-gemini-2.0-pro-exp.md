# Attack Surface Analysis for pallets/flask

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Jinja2 templating engine where user-supplied input is treated as template code, allowing execution of arbitrary code on the server.
*How Flask Contributes:* Flask uses Jinja2 as its default templating engine, making SSTI a primary concern if user input is not handled correctly within templates. This is a *direct* consequence of Flask's choice of templating engine.
*Example:* If a template renders `{{ user_input }}`, and `user_input` is `{{ config }}` or `{{ self.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__() }}`, the attacker can access configuration data or potentially execute system commands.
*Impact:* Complete server compromise, data exfiltration, remote code execution.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Never** directly embed unsanitized user input into templates.
    *   Ensure Jinja2's auto-escaping is enabled (default in Flask).
    *   If rendering user-provided HTML, use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., Bleach) *before* passing it to the template.
    *   Consider sandboxed template environments for untrusted template sources.
    *   Regularly update Jinja2 to the latest version.

## Attack Surface: [Route Manipulation and Unauthorized Access (Specifically due to Flask's Routing)](./attack_surfaces/route_manipulation_and_unauthorized_access__specifically_due_to_flask's_routing_.md)

*Description:* Attackers manipulate URL routes to access unintended view functions or bypass authorization checks, exploiting Flask's routing mechanism.
*How Flask Contributes:* This is *directly* related to how Flask handles routing.  Overly broad routes, dynamic segments without proper validation, and reliance on route definitions alone for security are all Flask-specific concerns.
*Example:* A route `/user/<username>` without sanitizing `username` could allow directory traversal if `username` is `../../etc/passwd`. A route `/admin/<path:resource>` without *internal* authorization checks (even if the route *looks* restricted) could expose admin functionality.
*Impact:* Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, privilege escalation.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Use precise, well-defined routes. Avoid overly permissive regular expressions.
    *   Validate and sanitize *all* user-provided input used in routes, especially dynamic segments.
    *   Implement robust authorization checks *within* view functions, not just relying on route definitions. This is crucial: even if a route *appears* to be restricted, the view function itself must verify authorization.
    *   Use Flask's built-in URL converters (e.g., `int`, `float`, `path`) for type enforcement.
    *   Utilize blueprints for better route organization and easier auditing.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Session Data Tampering (Due to Flask's Default Session Handling)](./attack_surfaces/client-side_session_data_tampering__due_to_flask's_default_session_handling_.md)

*Description:* Attackers modify the contents of client-side session cookies to gain unauthorized access or privileges, exploiting Flask's default session implementation.
*How Flask Contributes:* Flask's *default* session management uses client-side cookies, which are cryptographically signed but not encrypted. This is a direct design choice of Flask. The vulnerability arises from misusing this default behavior.
*Example:* If a user's role ("admin" or "user") is stored directly in the session cookie, an attacker could modify it to "admin" if they can guess or obtain the secret key.
*Impact:* Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to data and functionality.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Use a strong, randomly generated, and *secret* `SECRET_KEY`.
    *   **Never** store sensitive data (roles, permissions, API keys) directly in the session cookie. Store only a session identifier and retrieve sensitive data server-side. This is the most important mitigation.
    *   Consider server-side sessions (e.g., Flask-Session extension) for storing larger or more sensitive session data. This moves the session data to the server, mitigating the risk of client-side tampering.
    *   Set appropriate cookie attributes (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).
