## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This attack exploits vulnerabilities in how user input is handled within Jinja2 templates. If input is not properly sanitized or escaped, an attacker can inject malicious code that is executed on the server.

*   **Attack Steps:**

    *   **[[User Input]]**:
        *   *Description:* The attacker provides malicious input through various means, such as form fields, URL parameters, or other data entry points within the application. This is the initial point of contact for the attack.
        *   *Example:* A user submits a form with a field containing `{{ config }}`.

    *   **[[Craft Malicious Template Input]]**:
        *   *Description:* The attacker crafts the input specifically to exploit Jinja2's template syntax. This involves using Jinja2 directives and expressions to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data.
        *   *Example:* Input like `{{ self.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__() }}` attempts to access Python class information. More dangerous payloads could attempt to read files (`{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[40]('/etc/passwd').read() }}`) or execute shell commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Debug Mode Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/debug_mode_exploitation.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This attack leverages the features exposed when Flask's debug mode is enabled in a production environment. The Werkzeug debugger, in particular, provides an interactive console that allows for arbitrary code execution.

*   **Attack Steps:**

    *   **[[Enabled in Prod]]**:
        *   *Description:* The Flask application is running with `DEBUG=True` (or equivalent) in a production environment. This is a critical misconfiguration.
        *   *Example:* The environment variable `FLASK_DEBUG` is set to `1` on the production server.

    *   **[[Network Access]]**:
        *   *Description:* The attacker has network access to the server running the Flask application. This could be direct access or through a compromised intermediary.
        *   *Example:* The attacker can reach the application's IP address and port.

    *   **[[No Auth on Debugger]]**:
        *    *Description:* The Werkzeug debugger, by default, does not require authentication. This makes exploitation trivial if the debugger is accessible.
        *    *Example:* Accessing `/console` on the debugger endpoint directly grants access without credentials.

    *   **[[Access Debugger Console (Werkzeug)]]**:
        *   *Description:* The attacker accesses the interactive debugger console provided by Werkzeug. This allows them to execute arbitrary Python code within the application's context.
        *   *Example:* The attacker navigates to a URL like `http://vulnerable-app.com/_werkzeug/debugger` and is presented with a code execution interface.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Weak Session Secret Key](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_weak_session_secret_key.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This vulnerability stems from using a weak, predictable, or easily guessable secret key for Flask's session management. A compromised secret key allows attackers to forge valid session cookies.

*   **Attack Steps (Simplified):**

    *   **[[Weak Session Secret Key]]**:
        *   *Description:* The Flask application is configured with a secret key that is not cryptographically secure.
        *   *Example:* The `SECRET_KEY` in the Flask configuration is set to a default value, a short string, or a word found in a dictionary.

    *   **[[Predictable Key]]**:
        *   *Description:* The secret key is generated in a predictable way, making it vulnerable to guessing or brute-force attacks.
        *   *Example:* The key is derived from a timestamp or a simple algorithm that an attacker can replicate.
