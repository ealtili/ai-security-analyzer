# BUSINESS POSTURE

Flask is a micro web framework for Python. Its primary business goal is to provide a flexible and lightweight tool for developers to build web applications, APIs, and web services.

Business Priorities and Goals:

- Enable rapid development of web applications.
- Provide a flexible and extensible framework that can be adapted to various project needs.
- Maintain a lightweight core framework, allowing developers to add only necessary components.
- Foster a strong and active community to support and extend the framework.
- Ensure the framework is robust and reliable for production use.

Business Risks:

- Risk of losing developer adoption to competing frameworks if Flask fails to adapt to evolving web development trends or lacks essential features.
- Risk of security vulnerabilities in the framework core that could impact applications built with Flask, damaging reputation and user trust.
- Risk of insufficient community support leading to slow bug fixes, lack of documentation, and fewer contributions.
- Risk of performance bottlenecks in the framework core hindering the performance of applications built with Flask.
- Risk of breaking changes in new versions disrupting existing applications and developer workflows.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Security Controls:

- security control: Code review process for contributions to the Flask framework. (Implemented in: GitHub Pull Request reviews)
- security control: Automated testing including unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. (Implemented in: GitHub Actions CI pipelines, described in repository documentation and CI configuration)
- security control: Dependency management using `pip` and `requirements.txt` to track and manage project dependencies. (Implemented in: project setup, `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` files)
- security control: Usage of secure coding practices within the Flask codebase, such as input sanitization and output encoding where framework handles user inputs. (Implemented in: Flask codebase, implicitly part of development practices)
- security control: Public vulnerability reporting and disclosure process, allowing security researchers to report issues. (Documented in: Flask security policy, usually on website or security advisory channels)
- security control: Regular releases and security patches to address reported vulnerabilities. (Implemented in: Flask release management process, release notes and changelogs)

Accepted Risks:

- accepted risk: Security of applications built using Flask is ultimately the responsibility of the application developers. Flask provides tools but cannot enforce secure application design.
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party extensions or libraries used with Flask are outside of the Flask project's direct control.
- accepted risk: Outdated versions of Flask used by applications may contain known vulnerabilities if developers do not upgrade.

Recommended Security Controls:

- security control: Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan code for potential vulnerabilities during development.
- security control: Implement Dependency Vulnerability Scanning to automatically check for known vulnerabilities in Flask's dependencies and alert developers.
- security control: Provide more comprehensive security documentation and best practices guides for developers using Flask to build applications.
- security control: Consider incorporating Fuzz testing to discover unexpected vulnerabilities in the framework.
- security control: Promote and potentially automate security audits of the Flask codebase by external security experts.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication: Flask itself does not enforce authentication. Applications built with Flask need to implement authentication mechanisms based on their specific requirements. Flask provides tools and extensions to help with authentication.
- Authorization: Flask provides mechanisms for route protection and access control within applications. Applications need to define and implement their authorization logic.
- Input Validation: Flask provides tools for handling user input, and applications are responsible for validating and sanitizing input to prevent vulnerabilities like injection attacks. Framework encourages secure practices but relies on developers to implement them.
- Cryptography: Flask itself does not provide cryptographic primitives but relies on Python's standard library and external libraries like `cryptography`. Applications using Flask are responsible for implementing cryptography securely when needed, for example for handling sensitive data or sessions. Flask can be used over HTTPS for transport security.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Process:

- Enabling web application development: Flask's primary purpose is to empower developers to build web applications efficiently and effectively. Any compromise to Flask's integrity, availability, or security directly impacts this critical business process.

Data Sensitivity:

- Data handled by Flask applications: Flask itself doesn't handle data directly. However, applications built with Flask can handle a wide range of data with varying sensitivity levels, including:
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Usernames, passwords, email addresses, personal details. Sensitivity: High. Requires strong confidentiality and integrity protections.
    - Financial Data: Credit card numbers, bank account details, transaction history. Sensitivity: Very High. Requires strict compliance with regulations (e.g., PCI DSS) and robust security measures.
    - Business Data: Proprietary business information, trade secrets, customer data. Sensitivity: Medium to High. Depends on the nature of the data and potential impact of disclosure.
    - Public Data: Blog posts, articles, publicly accessible content. Sensitivity: Low. Primarily requires integrity and availability.

The sensitivity of data depends entirely on the applications built using Flask. However, vulnerabilities in Flask itself can potentially expose any data handled by applications built on top of it. Therefore, the security of Flask is paramount, regardless of the specific data sensitivity of individual applications.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What is the intended scale and performance requirements for applications built with Flask? (Assumption: Applications can range from small to medium scale, performance is important but not always the primary driver).
- What are the compliance requirements for applications built with Flask? (Assumption: Compliance requirements vary depending on the application, but general security best practices are always relevant).
- What is the level of security expertise of developers using Flask? (Assumption: Developers have varying levels of security expertise, so Flask should be secure by default and provide clear security guidance).
- What is the expected lifespan of applications built with Flask? (Assumption: Applications can have varying lifespans, so maintainability and long-term security are important).

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a flexible, lightweight, and developer-friendly web framework. Security is a high priority for the framework itself to ensure the safety of applications built with it.
- SECURITY POSTURE:  Flask project follows secure development practices but relies on application developers to implement security in their applications. Security updates and vulnerability management are critical for the Flask project.
- DESIGN: Containerized deployment on cloud platforms is a common and relevant deployment model for Flask applications. The build process includes automated security checks.
