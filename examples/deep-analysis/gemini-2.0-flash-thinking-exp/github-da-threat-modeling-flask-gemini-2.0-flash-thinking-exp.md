# Threat Model Analysis for pallets/flask

## Threat: [Weak Secret Key](./threats/weak_secret_key.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to brute-force or guess the `SECRET_KEY` used by Flask. If successful, they can decrypt and forge session cookies. This allows them to hijack user sessions, impersonate users, and bypass authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full account takeover, data breaches, unauthorized actions performed under victim's identity, potential for lateral movement within the application.
    *   **Affected Flask Component:** `Flask` application configuration, session management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Generate a cryptographically strong, random `SECRET_KEY`.
        *   Store the `SECRET_KEY` securely, outside of the codebase (e.g., environment variables, secrets management systems).
        *   Rotate the `SECRET_KEY` periodically.
        *   Implement monitoring for suspicious session activity.

## Threat: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./threats/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can leverage the debug mode's interactive debugger and exposed endpoints to gain sensitive information about the application's internal workings. They might access stack traces revealing code paths and vulnerabilities, or even execute arbitrary code on the server through the debugger console.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Remote code execution, information disclosure (source code, environment variables, database credentials), server compromise.
    *   **Affected Flask Component:** `Flask` application configuration, Werkzeug debugger (part of Flask ecosystem).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** enable `debug=True` in production environments.
        *   Ensure `FLASK_ENV` or similar environment variables are set to 'production' in production deployments.
        *   Implement proper environment-specific configuration management.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Jinja](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_jinja.md)

*   **Description:** If user-controlled input is directly rendered in Jinja templates without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious Jinja code. This code executes server-side, allowing them to achieve remote code execution, read sensitive files, or manipulate the application's behavior.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Remote code execution, data breaches, server compromise, information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Flask Component:** Jinja templating engine (tightly integrated default for Flask), `render_template_string` function.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid** using `render_template_string` with user-provided input if possible.
        *   If dynamic templates are necessary, use a secure templating approach, such as using a sandboxed or restricted Jinja environment.
        *   Sanitize and validate user input thoroughly before passing it to Jinja templates.
        *   Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful SSTI attacks.

## Threat: [Session Fixation](./threats/session_fixation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could force a user to use a pre-determined session ID. If the application doesn't regenerate the session ID after successful login, the attacker can then use the same session ID after the legitimate user authenticates to hijack their session.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Session hijacking, account takeover.
    *   **Affected Flask Component:** Session management, `session` object.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regenerate the session ID upon successful user authentication (e.g., using `session.regenerate()`).
        *   Use `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for session cookies to reduce client-side attacks.
        *   Implement session timeouts and inactivity limits.

## Threat: [Route Handling Logic Errors Leading to Access Bypass](./threats/route_handling_logic_errors_leading_to_access_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Logic errors within Flask route handler functions can lead to authorization bypasses. For example, a flawed conditional statement or incorrect permission check might allow unauthorized users to access protected resources or perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Authorization bypass, privilege escalation, unauthorized access to data or functionalities.
    *   **Affected Flask Component:** Flask route handlers (functions decorated with `@app.route` or `@blueprint.route`), application logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust and well-tested authorization logic in route handlers.
        *   Use established authorization frameworks or libraries to simplify and secure access control.
        *   Perform thorough code reviews and security testing of route handler logic, especially authorization checks.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to resources and functionalities.
