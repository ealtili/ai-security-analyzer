## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_server-side_template_injection__ssti___high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Vulnerability:** Improper handling of Jinja2 templates where user-controlled input is directly embedded without sanitization.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker identifies input fields or URL parameters that are reflected in the application's templates.
    *   Attacker crafts a malicious payload using Jinja2 syntax (e.g., `{{ ... }}`) to execute arbitrary Python code on the server.
    *   Attacker injects this payload into the vulnerable input and triggers template rendering.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Avoid rendering user-provided raw input directly in templates.
    *   Use parameterized queries or ORM for database interactions.
    *   If dynamic templates are needed, use safe contexts or sandboxed environments.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Session Hijacking via Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [HIGH-RISK PATH - via XSS] [CRITICAL NODE - XSS leading to session theft]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_session_hijacking_via_cross-site_scripting__xss___high-risk_path_-_via_xss___critical_nod_2afc26c5.md)

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Flask application allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript in a user's browser.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker finds an XSS vulnerability (e.g., reflected or stored XSS).
    *   Attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript payload designed to steal session cookies.
    *   Attacker injects the XSS payload into the application.
    *   When a user visits the vulnerable page, the JavaScript executes, steals the session cookie, and sends it to the attacker.
    *   Attacker uses the stolen session cookie to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, data access, unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Set `HttpOnly` flag on session cookies to prevent JavaScript access.
    *   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict JavaScript execution sources.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Cookie Stealing via Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [HIGH-RISK PATH - via XSS] [CRITICAL NODE - XSS leading to cookie theft]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_cookie_stealing_via_cross-site_scripting__xss___high-risk_path_-_via_xss___critical_node__810a03b8.md)

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Flask application.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Similar to session hijacking via XSS, but targets other cookies used by the application.
    *   Attacker crafts JavaScript to steal cookies that might contain sensitive information or be used for authentication or authorization.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the cookie's purpose, potential account compromise, information disclosure, or bypass of security features.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Same XSS prevention and mitigation strategies as for session hijacking via XSS.
    *   Minimize the use of cookies for sensitive client-side logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Flask Configuration Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_flask_configuration_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **4.1. Debug Mode Enabled in Production [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Vulnerability:** Flask application is deployed with `debug=True`.
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   Attacker accesses debug endpoints exposed by Werkzeug debugger (e.g., `/__debugger__`).
            *   Attacker uses the debugger to execute arbitrary Python code on the server.
        *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), full server compromise.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Never** run Flask applications with `debug=True` in production.
            *   Ensure `debug=False` in production configuration.

    *   **4.2. Insecure Secret Key [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Vulnerability:** Weak, default, or publicly known `SECRET_KEY` is used.
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   Attacker identifies or guesses the `SECRET_KEY`.
            *   Attacker uses the key to forge signed data, such as session cookies or CSRF tokens.
            *   Attacker can manipulate sessions, bypass CSRF protection, or exploit other security features relying on the `SECRET_KEY`.
        *   **Impact:** Session manipulation, account takeover, CSRF bypass, potential privilege escalation.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Use a strong, randomly generated `SECRET_KEY`.
            *   Store the `SECRET_KEY` securely (environment variables, secrets management).
            *   Rotate the `SECRET_KEY` periodically for highly sensitive applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Flask Extension Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_flask_extension_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Vulnerability:** Vulnerabilities in Flask extensions used by the application.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker identifies Flask extensions used by the application (e.g., through fingerprinting or dependency analysis).
    *   Attacker researches known vulnerabilities in those extensions (e.g., using vulnerability databases, security advisories).
    *   Attacker targets vulnerable endpoints or functionalities provided by the extension.
    *   Attacker exploits the vulnerability to compromise the application.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the extension and vulnerability, potential Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breach, denial of service, or other application-specific compromises.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Regularly audit and update Flask extensions.
    *   Use dependency management tools to track and update extension versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit File Serving Misconfigurations (Static Files)](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_file_serving_misconfigurations__static_files_.md)

*   **6.1. Directory Traversal via Static Files [HIGH-RISK PATH - Information Disclosure]:**
        *   **Vulnerability:** Improper configuration of static file serving allows access to files outside the intended static directory.
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   Attacker identifies the static file serving endpoint.
            *   Attacker crafts URLs using directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside the designated static directory.
        *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, access to sensitive files, potential source code exposure.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Properly configure static file directories and restrict access.
            *   Avoid serving static files from the application's root directory.
            *   Sanitize or reject URLs containing directory traversal sequences.

    *   **6.2. Information Disclosure via Static Files [HIGH-RISK PATH - Sensitive File Exposure] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
