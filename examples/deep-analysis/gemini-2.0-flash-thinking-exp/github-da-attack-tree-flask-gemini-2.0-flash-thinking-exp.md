## Attack Tree Path: [1. Parameter Injection through Route Variables [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__parameter_injection_through_route_variables__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Name:** Parameter Injection through Route Variables
*   **Description:** Attackers exploit applications that directly use route variables (parameters in the URL path) in backend queries or commands without proper sanitization or validation. This can lead to injection vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or Command Injection.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Data breach, system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Sanitize and validate all input from route variables.
    *   Use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL Injection.
    *   Avoid constructing dynamic commands directly from route variables.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Jinja2 Template Engine Vulnerabilities (SSTI) [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__jinja2_template_engine_vulnerabilities__ssti___high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Name:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template engines (like Jinja2 in Flask) when user-provided input is directly embedded in templates without proper escaping or sandboxing. Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Critical (Remote Code Execution)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Avoid directly embedding user input in templates whenever possible.
    *   Always use Jinja2's autoescape feature to automatically escape output.
    *   If dynamic templates from user input are absolutely necessary, use a secure sandboxing environment or pre-compile templates.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Session Hijacking due to Weak Secret Key [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__session_hijacking_due_to_weak_secret_key__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Name:** Session Hijacking due to Weak Secret Key
*   **Description:** Flask uses a `SECRET_KEY` to cryptographically sign session cookies. If a weak or default `SECRET_KEY` is used, attackers can potentially guess or obtain the key, allowing them to forge session cookies and hijack user sessions.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Session hijacking, unauthorized access)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Generate a strong, random, and long `SECRET_KEY`.
    *   Securely store and manage the `SECRET_KEY` (e.g., using environment variables, secrets management systems).
    *   Regularly rotate the `SECRET_KEY` if feasible.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. File Upload Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__file_upload_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Name:** File Upload Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:** If a Flask application allows file uploads without proper validation, attackers can upload malicious files. These files could be executables for Remote Code Execution (RCE), HTML/JavaScript for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or simply consume excessive server resources, leading to various security issues.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Remote Code Execution, Cross-Site Scripting, data compromise, system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement strict file validation:
        *   Check file type based on content (magic numbers) and not just extension.
        *   Limit file size.
        *   Validate file content for malicious payloads.
    *   Store uploaded files outside the web root to prevent direct execution.
    *   Use secure file storage mechanisms and consider malware scanning for uploaded files.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Debug Mode Enabled in Production [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/5__debug_mode_enabled_in_production__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Name:** Debug Mode Enabled in Production
*   **Description:** Running a Flask application with debug mode enabled in a production environment is a critical misconfiguration. Debug mode often exposes sensitive information (source code, configuration), allows interactive debugging and code execution through a debugger console, and disables certain security measures, making the application highly vulnerable.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Critical (Remote Code Execution, Information Disclosure, full system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Absolutely ensure debug mode is disabled in production.** Set `FLASK_DEBUG=0` or `app.debug = False` for production deployments.
    *   Implement proper environment management to differentiate between development and production configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Insecure Handling of Flask's Secret Keys and Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6__insecure_handling_of_flask's_secret_keys_and_configuration__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Name:** Insecure Handling of Secret Keys and Configuration
*   **Description:** Storing sensitive configuration, including Flask's `SECRET_KEY`, database credentials, API keys, etc., directly in the application code or exposing them in version control systems is a major security risk. Attackers gaining access to this information can compromise the application and related systems.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Exposure of credentials, session hijacking, potential access to backend systems, data breach)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (without code access)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Never hardcode sensitive configuration in the application code.**
    *   Store sensitive configuration outside the application code, preferably in environment variables or dedicated secrets management systems (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.).
    *   Avoid committing configuration files containing secrets to version control.
    *   Use `.gitignore` or similar mechanisms to exclude sensitive configuration files from version control.
