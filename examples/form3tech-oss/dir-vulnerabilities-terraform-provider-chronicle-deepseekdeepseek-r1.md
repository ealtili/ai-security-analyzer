Here is the updated vulnerability list integrating findings from the new project files:

### 1. Missing Authentication in Google Cloud Storage Bucket Feed (New)
- **Description**: The Google Cloud Storage Bucket feed resource allows configuration without any authentication mechanism. Users can configure GCS feeds without providing credentials, leading to either ingestion failures or potential use of insecure default credentials.
- **Impact**: Unauthenticated access to GCS buckets could result in data ingestion issues or unintended access to storage resources if default credentials are leveraged.
- **Rank**: High
- **Preconditions**: User configures a GCS feed without providing authentication credentials.
- **Source Code Analysis**:
  - In `resource_feed_google_cloud_storage_bucket.go`, the schema lacks authentication fields entirely.
  - Example: The [GCS example](../examples/resources/feed/google_cloud_storage_bucket/main.tf) shows a configuration with no authentication block.
- **Missing Mitigations**: Authentication schema requirements for GCS feeds (e.g., service account keys).
- **Security Test Case**:
  1. Define a `google_cloud_storage_bucket` feed without authentication credentials.
  2. Run `terraform apply` and verify if the provider accepts the invalid configuration.

### 2. Insecure HTTP Custom Endpoints (Existing - Updated)
- **Description**: Custom endpoints and hostnames accept HTTP without HTTPS enforcement across multiple feed types (Qualys VM, Okta, Thinkst Canary).
- **Impact**: MITM attacks could intercept credentials or sensitive data.
- **Rank**: High
- **Preconditions**: Attacker controls network path to custom endpoint.
- **Source Code Analysis**:
  - Confirmed in multiple feed types through examples like `hostname = "qualysapi.qualys.com/..."` (HTTP) in Qualys VM feed.
- **Missing Mitigations**: HTTPS validation for all endpoint/hostname fields.
- **Security Test Case**: Unchanged from previous.

### 3. Missing Authentication Validation in Azure Blobstore Feed (Existing)
- **Description**: Azure Blobstore feed allows omission of both `shared_key` and `sas_token`.
- **Impact**: Operational failures due to invalid configurations.
- **Rank**: Medium
- **Preconditions**: User omits both authentication methods.
- **Source Code Analysis**:
  - Confirmed through [Azure example](../examples/resources/feed/azure_blobstore/main.tf) where only `shared_key` is used, but schema allows omission.
- **Missing Mitigations**: Mutual exclusion validation for authentication methods.
- **Security Test Case**: Unchanged.

### 4. Sensitive Data Exposure via Logs (Existing)
- **Description**: Potential logging of secrets in debug outputs.
- **Impact**: Credential leakage through logs.
- **Rank**: High
- **Preconditions**: Debug logging enabled.
- **Source Code Analysis**:
  - Still relevant as authentication secrets (e.g., `secret_access_key` in SQS/S3 examples) could be logged.
- **Missing Mitigations**: Full redaction in logs.
- **Security Test Case**: Unchanged.

### 5. Improper Error Handling (Existing)
- **Description**: Raw API errors may expose internal details.
- **Impact**: Information disclosure.
- **Rank**: Medium
- **Preconditions**: API returns verbose errors.
- **Source Code Analysis**:
  - Still relevant across all API interactions.
- **Missing Mitigations**: Error sanitization.
- **Security Test Case**: Unchanged.

---

### Notes:
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
  - Sensitive fields marked as `Sensitive: true` in schemas (prevents Terraform UI/logging exposure).
  - `ConflictsWith` constraints for authentication methods where implemented.
- **Exclusions**:
  - DoS and documentation-related issues excluded per instructions.
- **New Findings**:
  - Google Cloud Storage Bucket feed lacks authentication requirements, adding a critical misconfiguration vulnerability.
