### Threat Model for Terraform Chronicle Provider

- Threat: Credential Exposure in Terraform State
  - Description: Terraform state files, if not properly secured, can store sensitive credentials (like API keys, access tokens, and secrets for Chronicle and integrated services like AWS, Azure, Okta, Proofpoint, Qualys, Thinkst Canary, Microsoft Office 365) in plaintext. An attacker gaining unauthorized access to the state file (e.g., through compromised storage backend, accidental exposure, or insider threat) could extract these credentials.
  - Impact: Critical. Full compromise of Chronicle account and potentially connected external services and data sources. Attackers could gain complete control over Chronicle resources, ingest malicious data, exfiltrate sensitive information, or disrupt operations.
  - Affected Component: Terraform State Management, Provider Configuration (provider.go), all resource types that handle credentials (feed resources, provider configuration).
  - Current Mitigations: None explicitly mentioned in the provided files. The documentation mentions storing credentials as strings in Terraform configuration, implying they might end up in the state. This significantly increases risk severity.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement state file encryption at rest using Terraform backend features (e.g., using KMS encryption for S3 or Google Cloud Storage backends).
    - Recommend and document secure state backends with access control and audit logging.
    - Advocate for using short-lived access tokens instead of long-term credentials where possible.
    - Implement secret management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider secret managers) to avoid storing credentials directly in Terraform configuration and state.
  - Risk Severity: Critical

- Threat: Credential Leakage via Provider Code Vulnerabilities
  - Description:  Vulnerabilities in the Terraform provider's Go code could inadvertently lead to the leakage of sensitive credentials. This could occur through various means, such as:
    - Logging credentials in plain text during debugging or error handling.
    - Storing credentials in insecure temporary files or memory locations.
    - Exposing credentials through insecure API endpoints or interfaces (though less likely in a provider).
    - Vulnerabilities in how credentials are parsed, processed, or transmitted.
  An attacker exploiting such vulnerabilities (e.g., through code injection, log access, memory dumping in compromised environments) could gain access to these credentials.
  - Impact: High. Potential compromise of Chronicle account and connected external services. Attackers could use leaked credentials to perform unauthorized actions, access sensitive data, or disrupt services.
  - Affected Component: Provider Code (chronicle package, especially `provider.go`, `*_helper.go`, and resource implementation files like `resource_feed_amazon_s3.go`, `resource_feed_qualys_vm.go`, `resource_feed_thinkst_canary.go`), Logging mechanisms.
  - Current Mitigations:
    - Code review processes (implicitly through GitHub pull requests and CI workflows like `ci.yaml` and `lint.yaml`).
    - Static code analysis using `golangci-lint` (workflow `lint.yaml`) to identify potential code quality and security issues.
    - `gofmtcheck.sh` script to enforce code formatting, indirectly improving code readability and maintainability, which can aid in security reviews.
  These mitigations reduce the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities, but don't eliminate the risk entirely. Sensitive data handling in code requires careful attention.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools specifically focused on security vulnerabilities (beyond linters).
    - Conduct regular manual security code reviews, focusing on credential handling and sensitive data flows.
    - Implement dynamic analysis and fuzzing to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
    - Adopt secure coding practices for credential management, such as avoiding logging credentials, using secure memory handling, and minimizing credential exposure in code.
  - Risk Severity: High

- Threat: Man-in-the-Middle Attack on API Communication
  - Description: If the communication between the Terraform provider and the Chronicle APIs (Backstory API, Ingestion API, etc.) is not consistently and strongly encrypted using HTTPS, or if there are weaknesses in the TLS/SSL configuration, an attacker positioned on the network path could potentially intercept sensitive data transmitted during API calls. This intercepted data could include API credentials (access tokens, credentials), configuration data, or even ingested log data.
  - Impact: High. Credential theft, interception of sensitive configuration and log data, potential manipulation of Chronicle resources by injecting malicious API requests.
  - Affected Component: Provider Client (`client` package, network communication functions in `provider.go` and `*_helper.go`), API interaction logic.
  - Current Mitigations: HTTPS is generally assumed for API communication in cloud environments, and Terraform providers typically use HTTPS for API calls. However, explicit enforcement and verification in the provider code are not evident from the provided files. The risk is mitigated by the general practice of using HTTPS for cloud APIs, but lack of explicit enforcement increases the potential for misconfiguration or downgrade attacks.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Explicitly enforce HTTPS for all API communication with Chronicle services within the provider code.
    - Implement TLS/SSL certificate validation to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks using forged certificates.
    - Consider implementing HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) in the Chronicle APIs and ensure the provider client respects it.
    - Document the importance of secure network configurations and avoiding insecure network connections when using the provider.
  - Risk Severity: High

- Threat: Feed Misconfiguration Leading to Data Leaks or Unauthorized Access to Source Systems
  - Description: Incorrectly configured feed resources can lead to several security issues:
    - **Data Leaks to Chronicle:**  A misconfigured feed might unintentionally ingest data from a source system that is more sensitive or contains more data than intended, leading to data being stored in Chronicle that should not be there. For example, an overly broad S3 URI or incorrect filtering could ingest sensitive files.
    - **Unauthorized Access to Source Systems:** While less direct, misconfiguration could expose credentials used to access source systems (like AWS access keys in S3 feed configurations, Thinkst Canary API keys, Qualys VM credentials) if these configurations are inadvertently exposed or logged insecurely.
  - Impact: High. Data leaks of sensitive information into Chronicle, potentially exposing confidential data to unauthorized Chronicle users. Indirect risk of unauthorized access to source systems if credentials are leaked due to misconfiguration.
  - Affected Component: Feed Resources (`resource_feed_amazon_s3.go`, `resource_feed_amazon_sqs.go`, `resource_feed_azure_blobstore.go`, `resource_feed_google_cloud_storage_bucket.go`, `resource_feed_microsoft_office_365_management_activity.go`, `resource_feed_okta_system_log.go`, `resource_feed_okta_users.go`, `resource_feed_proofpoint_siem.go`, `resource_feed_qualys_vm.go`, `resource_feed_thinkst_canary.go`), User Configuration of feed resources in Terraform.
  - Current Mitigations:
    - Input validation within the provider code (e.g., URI validation using `validateGCSURI`, `validateFeedS3SourceType`, `validateThinkstCanaryHostname`, etc., and data type validation in schema definitions).
    - Schema definitions in resource files (`resource_feed_*.go`) enforce required fields and types, reducing basic configuration errors.
  These mitigations prevent some basic misconfigurations, but do not address complex logical misconfigurations or overly permissive settings.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Provide comprehensive documentation and examples emphasizing secure feed configurations and least privilege principles.
    - Develop and recommend tools or scripts to validate feed configurations against security best practices before deployment.
    - Implement more granular input validation and sanitization for feed details, especially for URIs and authentication parameters.
    - Encourage users to use least privilege IAM roles and access policies for feed authentication to source systems.
    - Implement monitoring and alerting for feed configuration changes and potential anomalies in data ingestion.
  - Risk Severity: High

- Threat: RBAC Subject Misconfiguration Leading to Unauthorized Access within Chronicle
  - Description: Incorrectly configured RBAC subjects can grant excessive permissions to users or groups within Chronicle. For instance, assigning the "Editor" or "Administrator" role to a subject that should only have "Analyst" permissions. This can lead to unauthorized users gaining access to sensitive Chronicle data, modifying critical configurations, or performing actions beyond their intended scope.
  - Impact: Medium. Unauthorized access to Chronicle data and functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or service disruption within Chronicle.
  - Affected Component: RBAC Subject Resource (`resource_rbac_subject.go`), User Configuration of RBAC subjects.
  - Current Mitigations:
    - Type validation for the `type` attribute of the `chronicle_rbac_subject` resource (schema definition in `resource_rbac_subject.go`).
    - Validation of allowed `roles` (implicitly by the Chronicle API during resource creation/update).
  These mitigations prevent basic type errors and invalid role assignments, but do not prevent logical misconfigurations where users are granted overly broad permissions.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Provide clear guidance and best practices for implementing least privilege RBAC within Chronicle using the provider.
    - Develop and recommend tools or scripts to analyze and validate RBAC configurations to identify overly permissive assignments.
    - Implement more fine-grained role definitions and permission controls within Chronicle itself (feature request for Chronicle service, not provider).
    - Encourage regular reviews and audits of RBAC configurations to detect and correct misconfigurations over time.
  - Risk Severity: Medium

- Threat: Vulnerable Dependencies
  - Description: The Terraform Chronicle provider, being a Go application, relies on external Go libraries (dependencies). If any of these dependencies contain known security vulnerabilities, those vulnerabilities could be inherited by the provider. Exploiting these vulnerabilities in the provider could potentially compromise the provider's functionality or the systems where it is executed.
  - Impact: Medium to High. The impact depends on the severity and exploitability of the vulnerabilities in the dependencies. Could range from denial of service to remote code execution in the Terraform provider process or the systems managing Terraform execution.
  - Affected Component: Provider Dependencies (managed by `go.mod` and potentially vendored in `vendor/` directory).
  - Current Mitigations:
    - Dependency management using `go.mod` to track and manage project dependencies.
    - Regular checks for code formatting and linting using `gofmtcheck.sh` and `golangci-lint` (workflows `ci.yaml`, `lint.yaml`), which can indirectly improve code quality and potentially reduce the introduction of vulnerabilities, although they don't directly address dependency vulnerabilities.
  These mitigations help with code quality but do not actively scan for or mitigate dependency vulnerabilities.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using `govulncheck` or other dependency scanning tools).
    - Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Conduct periodic security audits of the provider's dependencies and evaluate the risk of known vulnerabilities.
    - Consider using dependency pinning or vendoring to ensure consistent and controlled dependency versions.
  - Risk Severity: Medium

- Threat: Rule Injection and Misconfiguration
  - Description:  Users define detection rules using YARA-L. If the provider does not properly validate or sanitize the `rule_text` input, or if the Chronicle API itself is vulnerable to rule injection, an attacker could potentially inject malicious YARA-L rules. These rules could be designed to:
    - Exfiltrate data from Chronicle by crafting rules that trigger on sensitive data and send alerts to external systems controlled by the attacker (if alert actions are configurable and insecure).
    - Cause Denial of Service (DoS) by creating computationally expensive rules that overload the detection engine.
    - Bypass security controls by crafting rules that suppress or alter legitimate alerts.
  - Impact: High. Data exfiltration, Denial of Service of Chronicle detection capabilities, bypassing security monitoring, potentially leading to delayed incident response or missed security events.
  - Affected Component: Rule Resource (`resource_rule.go`), Rule validation logic (`validation.go`, `client\rule.go`), Chronicle API Rule processing.
  - Current Mitigations:
    - `validateRuleText` function in `validation.go` checks if `rule_text` ends with a newline. This is a very basic validation and does not prevent rule injection.
    - `VerifyYARARule` function in `client\rule.go` calls the Chronicle API to verify the YARA-L rule. This provides some level of server-side validation, but the robustness of this validation is unclear.
  Current mitigations are weak and likely insufficient to prevent rule injection attacks.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust server-side validation and sanitization of YARA-L rules within the Chronicle API to prevent injection attacks.
    - Consider using a YARA-L parser library within the provider to perform client-side validation before sending rules to the API.
    - Implement rate limiting and resource quotas for rule creation and updates to mitigate potential DoS attacks through rule injection.
    - If alert actions are configurable, ensure they are securely designed and validated to prevent abuse for data exfiltration.
    - Regularly audit and review deployed detection rules for suspicious or malicious patterns.
  - Risk Severity: High

- Threat: Exposure of Feed Authentication Details During Update
  - Description: In `resource_feed_thinkst_canary.go` and `resource_feed_qualys_vm.go`, the `flattenDetailsFromReadOperation` function, specifically for "Import Case" and "Default Case", might expose authentication `value` (Thinkst Canary API Key/Token) and `secret` (Qualys VM secret) during Terraform read operations or state refresh. While marked as sensitive in the schema, the provider code might temporarily log or process these values in a way that could be captured (e.g., in debug logs, error messages, or monitoring systems) during state refresh or import. This is especially concerning in the "Import Case" where the `value` is directly read from the API response and put into the state.
  - Impact: Medium. Potential exposure of Thinkst Canary API keys/tokens and Qualys VM secrets, leading to unauthorized access to Thinkst Canary or Qualys VM APIs.
  - Affected Component: Feed Resources (`resource_feed_thinkst_canary.go`, `resource_feed_qualys_vm.go`), `flattenDetailsFromReadOperation` function.
  - Current Mitigations:
    - The `value` and `secret` attributes in the schema are marked as `Sensitive: true`, which should prevent them from being displayed in Terraform plan outputs. However, it doesn't prevent potential leakage through logs or internal processing.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Review and refactor `flattenDetailsFromReadOperation` to minimize the handling and potential logging of sensitive authentication values during read operations.
    - Ensure that sensitive attributes are properly handled throughout the provider codebase and are not inadvertently logged or exposed in error messages.
    - Implement mechanisms to mask or redact sensitive values in logs and debug outputs.
    - Consider if it's necessary to retrieve and store the authentication `value` in the state at all during read operations. If not needed for management, avoid storing it in the state to reduce exposure.
  - Risk Severity: Medium
