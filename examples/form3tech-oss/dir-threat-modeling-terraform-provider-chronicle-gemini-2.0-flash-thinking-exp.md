- Threat: Credential Exposure in Terraform State
  - Description: Terraform state files, if not properly secured (e.g., stored in a remote backend with encryption), can expose sensitive credentials used by the Terraform provider to interact with Chronicle APIs and external services like AWS, Azure, Okta, etc. An attacker gaining access to the state file could extract these credentials.
  - Impact: High. Compromised credentials could allow unauthorized access to Chronicle and connected services. For Chronicle, this could lead to data manipulation, service disruption, or data exfiltration. For external services, it could lead to unauthorized access to those platforms and their data.
  - Affected Component: Terraform Provider, Terraform State File
  - Current Mitigations:
    - Credentials can be provided via environment variables, which are not stored in the state file if configured correctly.
    - Sensitive attributes like `secret_access_key`, `client_secret`, `shared_key`, and API tokens are marked as sensitive in the schema, which Terraform attempts to redact from logs and output, but they are still present in the state file.
    - Sensitive attribute marking in Terraform schema (`Sensitive: true`).
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Enforce and document best practices for securing Terraform state files, including using remote backends with encryption and access control.
    - Implement credential rotation and short-lived credentials where feasible.
    - Investigate and implement options for credential masking or encryption within the Terraform state itself for sensitive provider configurations.
  - Risk Severity: High

- Threat: Misconfiguration of Feed Resources leading to Data Integrity Issues
  - Description: Incorrectly configured feed resources (e.g., wrong S3 bucket URI, incorrect log type, faulty authentication details) can lead to various data integrity issues. This includes failing to ingest logs, ingesting logs from unintended sources, or incorrect parsing and labeling of ingested data. An attacker might intentionally misconfigure feeds to disrupt data ingestion or manipulate the data ingested into Chronicle.
  - Impact: Medium. Data integrity issues can lead to gaps in security monitoring, incorrect alerts, and flawed analysis within Chronicle.
  - Affected Component: Feed Resources (chronicle_feed_amazon_s3, chronicle_feed_amazon_sqs, chronicle_feed_azure_blobstore, chronicle_feed_google_cloud_storage_bucket, chronicle_feed_microsoft_office_365_management_activity, chronicle_feed_okta_system_log, chronicle_feed_okta_users, chronicle_feed_proofpoint_siem, chronicle_feed_qualys_vm, chronicle_feed_thinkst_canary)
  - Current Mitigations:
    - Input validation is present for some fields (e.g., `validateGCSURI`, `validateFeedS3SourceType`, `validateUUID`).
    - Type validation by Terraform schema.
    - Input validation functions for various feed parameters.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Enhance input validation for all critical feed parameters to prevent misconfigurations.
    - Provide clearer error messages and diagnostics for feed configuration failures.
    - Implement pre-flight checks or dry-run options for feed configurations to validate connectivity and settings before applying changes.
    - Improve documentation with examples and best practices for configuring different feed types securely and correctly.
  - Risk Severity: Medium

- Threat: Unauthorized Management of Chronicle Resources via Compromised Provider Credentials
  - Description: If the credentials used by the Terraform provider (e.g., `backstoryapi_credentials`, `ingestionapi_access_token`) are compromised, an attacker could use these credentials to manage Chronicle resources. This includes creating, modifying, or deleting rules, reference lists, feeds, and RBAC subjects, potentially leading to significant security breaches.
  - Impact: Critical. Full compromise of Chronicle security posture. Attackers could disable security monitoring, alter detection rules, exfiltrate or manipulate ingested data, and grant themselves persistent access.
  - Affected Component: Terraform Provider, Chronicle API Client, All Resource Types (chronicle_rbac_subject, chronicle_rule, chronicle_reference_list, chronicle_feed_*)
  - Current Mitigations:
    - Credentials can be kept secret and managed outside of the state file using environment variables or secure secret management solutions.
    - Credentials can be provided as access tokens, potentially limiting the scope and lifespan compared to long-term credentials files (though this is optional and depends on user configuration).
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Strongly recommend and document the use of short-lived access tokens and credential rotation.
    - Implement and document best practices for secure credential management with Terraform, emphasizing the use of external secret stores and avoiding embedding credentials directly in Terraform code.
    - Consider adding features to the provider to support integration with external secret management solutions for credential retrieval.
  - Risk Severity: Critical

- Threat: Data Exfiltration via Feed Redirection
  - Description: An attacker with control over feed resources could modify feed configurations to redirect ingested logs to storage locations they control (e.g., attacker-owned S3 bucket, Azure Blob Storage container, GCS bucket). This allows them to exfiltrate sensitive log data intended for Chronicle.
  - Impact: High. Confidentiality breach and potential exposure of sensitive security logs.
  - Affected Component: Feed Resources (chronicle_feed_amazon_s3, chronicle_feed_amazon_sqs, chronicle_feed_azure_blobstore, chronicle_feed_google_cloud_storage_bucket)
  - Current Mitigations:  Requires compromised Terraform credentials or direct access to Terraform configuration. RBAC in Chronicle (if properly configured) might limit who can manage feeds, but this is outside the scope of the provider itself.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement stricter validation and control over feed destination URIs to prevent redirection to unauthorized locations.
    - Provide audit logging of feed configuration changes within Chronicle to detect unauthorized modifications.
    - Document the risk of feed redirection and recommend monitoring feed configurations for unexpected changes.
  - Risk Severity: High

- Threat: Rule Manipulation leading to Missed Detections
  - Description: Attackers who gain unauthorized access to manage rule resources (via compromised Terraform credentials) could disable or modify detection rules within Chronicle. This could lead to critical security events going undetected, allowing attackers to operate without raising alerts.
  - Impact: High. Failure of security monitoring and potential for significant breaches to go unnoticed.
  - Affected Component: Rule Resource (chronicle_rule)
  - Current Mitigations:
    - RBAC in Chronicle (if properly configured) might limit who can manage rules.
    - Rule text is validated by Chronicle API during creation/update, preventing syntactically invalid rules.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement version control and audit logging for rule changes within Chronicle to track modifications and enable rollback.
    - Recommend and document the practice of regularly reviewing and testing detection rules to ensure their effectiveness and integrity.
    - Consider adding features to the provider to facilitate rule testing and validation workflows.
  - Risk Severity: High

- Threat: Reference List Manipulation leading to Detection Bypass or False Positives
  - Description: Attackers with control over reference list resources could modify the contents of reference lists. This could be used to bypass detection rules that rely on these lists (e.g., by removing malicious IPs from a blacklist) or to create false positives (e.g., by adding legitimate IPs to a blacklist, causing unnecessary alerts).
  - Impact: Medium. Reduced effectiveness of detection rules, potential for missed alerts or alert fatigue.
  - Affected Component: Reference List Resource (chronicle_reference_list)
  - Current Mitigations: RBAC in Chronicle (if properly configured) might limit who can manage reference lists.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement version control and audit logging for reference list changes within Chronicle to track modifications and enable rollback.
    - Recommend and document the practice of regularly reviewing and validating reference list contents for accuracy and integrity.
    - Consider adding features to the provider to facilitate reference list content validation and integrity checks.
  - Risk Severity: Medium

- Threat: RBAC Subject Manipulation leading to Privilege Escalation
  - Description: Attackers with sufficient privileges to manage RBAC subject resources could modify RBAC configurations to escalate privileges for themselves or other unauthorized users. This could grant them access to sensitive Chronicle functionalities or data beyond their intended permissions.
  - Impact: Medium. Unauthorized access to Chronicle functionalities and data, potential for further misuse of the platform.
  - Affected Component: RBAC Subject Resource (chronicle_rbac_subject)
  - Current Mitigations: RBAC in Chronicle itself controls access to RBAC management functions. Terraform provider simply manages RBAC subjects based on provided credentials.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    -  Emphasize the importance of least privilege principles when managing RBAC subjects with Terraform.
    -  Document best practices for RBAC configuration and auditing within Chronicle.
    -  Recommend regular reviews of RBAC configurations to detect and remediate any unauthorized privilege escalations.
  - Risk Severity: Medium
