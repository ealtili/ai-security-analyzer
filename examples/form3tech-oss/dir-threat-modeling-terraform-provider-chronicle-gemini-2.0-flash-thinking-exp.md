## Threat Model for Terraform Chronicle Provider

Here is the threat model for the Terraform Chronicle provider, based on the provided project files.

### Threat List

- **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Credentials in Terraform State Files
  - **Description:** Terraform state files, if not properly secured, can store sensitive credentials like API keys, access tokens, and secrets in plaintext. An attacker gaining unauthorized access to the state file (e.g., through compromised storage, accidental exposure, or insider threat) could extract these credentials. This access could be achieved by directly reading the state file from backend storage or indirectly by compromising systems or accounts with access to the state file.
  - **Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of Chronicle account and potentially external service accounts (AWS, Azure, GCP, Okta, Proofpoint, Qualys, Thinkst Canary). This can lead to unauthorized access to ingested logs, manipulation of Chronicle configurations, data breaches, and unauthorized data ingestion.
  - **Affected component:** Terraform state management, Resource configurations (e.g., `chronicle_feed_amazon_s3`, `chronicle_feed_okta_system_log`, `chronicle_feed_qualys_vm`, `chronicle_feed_thinkst_canary`, `chronicle_feed_azure_blobstore`, `chronicle_feed_google_cloud_storage_bucket`, `chronicle_feed_microsoft_office_365_management_activity`, `chronicle_feed_okta_users`, `chronicle_feed_proofpoint_siem` resources as defined in `docs/resources/feed_*.md` and implemented in `chronicle/resource_feed_*.go`). Specifically, attributes marked as `Sensitive: true` in the schema are intended to be protected, but their representation in the state file is a key concern.
  - **Current mitigations:**
    - The provider schema marks sensitive attributes (like `secret_access_key`, `client_secret`, `shared_key`, `sas_token`, `value`, `secret`, `user`) as `Sensitive: true`. This instructs Terraform to redact these values in the CLI output and mark them as sensitive in the state.
    - Documentation in `docs/index.md` suggests using environment variables for credentials as an alternative to hardcoding them in Terraform configurations, which can reduce the risk of secrets in state files if implemented correctly by users.
    - The order of precedence for API configuration (`Credential file through TF > Access Token through TF > Environment Variable`) allows users to prioritize more secure methods like credential files or access tokens over environment variables, depending on their security posture.
    - **Risk Severity Influence:** Medium. While sensitive attributes are marked, the default behavior of Terraform can still lead to credentials being stored in the state, and users might not be fully aware of the risks or best practices for state file security.
  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Stronger Documentation Warnings:** Emphasize more explicitly and prominently in the documentation the critical risks of storing sensitive credentials in Terraform state files. Provide best practice guidance on securing state files, including state backend encryption and access control.
    - **Encourage Environment Variables and External Secret Management:** More actively promote the use of environment variables or external secret management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager) as the preferred method for handling credentials. Provide examples and guidance on integrating these solutions with the provider.
    - **State Encryption by Default (Terraform Level):** While not directly a provider mitigation, advocate for and rely on Terraform's built-in state encryption features for backend storage. Ensure documentation clearly instructs users on how to enable and manage state encryption for their chosen backend.
  - **Risk severity:** Critical

- **Threat:** Credential Leakage through Provider Logs or Debugging Output
  - **Description:** If debug mode is enabled (as suggested in `debug.sh` for development) or if logging is not configured securely, sensitive credentials passed to the provider (e.g., in provider configuration or resource attributes) could be unintentionally logged in plaintext. This could expose credentials to anyone with access to the logs, including developers, CI/CD systems, or attackers who compromise logging infrastructure.
  - **Impact:** High. Compromise of Chronicle accounts and potentially external service accounts. Unauthorized access to Chronicle and external services, potentially leading to data breaches and unauthorized operations.
  - **Affected component:** Logging mechanisms within the provider (`main.go`, `chronicle/provider.go`), Debugging features (`debug.sh`), Resource configurations for new feeds (`chronicle/resource_feed_qualys_vm.go`, `chronicle/resource_feed_thinkst_canary.go`).
  - **Current mitigations:**
    - Debug mode is not enabled by default and requires explicit activation (e.g., by running `debug.sh` or setting a `debug` flag as seen in `main.go`). This reduces the risk of accidental exposure in production environments.
    - Sensitive attributes are marked, which might influence logging behavior in some contexts within Terraform, although provider-level logging needs to be explicitly checked.
    - **Risk Severity Influence:** Medium. Debug mode is opt-in, but if enabled during development or testing and logs are not secured, leakage is possible. Standard logging practices in Go applications might inadvertently log sensitive data if not carefully managed.
  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Secure Logging Practices Review:** Conduct a thorough review of the provider's codebase to identify all logging points, especially around credential handling. Ensure that sensitive parameters (especially those marked `Sensitive: true` in the schema) are explicitly excluded from logging output in both debug and regular logs for all resources, including new feed resources.
    - **Implement Secret Masking in Logs:** Implement a mechanism to automatically mask or redact sensitive information (like secrets, tokens, keys) in logs. Replace sensitive values with placeholders (e.g., `*****`) before logging.
    - **Guidance on Secure Logging Configuration:** Provide documentation and guidance to users on how to configure logging securely when debug mode is necessary, emphasizing the importance of restricting access to log files and using secure log storage and transmission mechanisms.
  - **Risk severity:** Medium

- **Threat:** Misconfiguration of Data Feeds Leading to Data Breaches or Unintended Data Ingestion
  - **Description:** Incorrectly configured feed resources (e.g., overly permissive S3 bucket permissions in `chronicle_feed_amazon_s3`, misconfigured Azure Blobstore URI in `chronicle_feed_azure_blobstore`, incorrect Okta API authentication in `chronicle_feed_okta_system_log`, or similar misconfigurations in `chronicle_feed_qualys_vm` and `chronicle_feed_thinkst_canary`) could lead to various security issues. This includes unintended ingestion of data into Chronicle (potentially exceeding storage limits or ingesting irrelevant data) or, more critically, data breaches if source systems are misconfigured to be publicly accessible due to errors in Terraform configuration. For example, if an S3 bucket is made public read due to a Terraform misconfiguration while setting up a feed, sensitive logs might be exposed.
  - **Impact:** Medium to High. Data breach (if source systems become publicly accessible due to misconfiguration), exposure of sensitive logs to unauthorized parties within Chronicle (if ingested into the wrong namespace or without proper access controls in Chronicle), compliance violations, unintended resource consumption in Chronicle.
  - **Affected component:** Feed resources (`docs/resources/feed_*.md`, `chronicle/resource_feed_*.go`, `chronicle/resource_feed_qualys_vm.go`, `chronicle/resource_feed_thinkst_canary.go`), particularly the configuration of external service authentication and data source URIs/paths.
  - **Current mitigations:**
    - Input validation is implemented for some parameters, such as validating AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key formats (`chronicle/resource_feed_amazon_s3.go`), validating GCS URIs (`chronicle/resource_feed_google_cloud_storage_bucket.go`), and UUID validation for Tenant IDs and Client IDs (`chronicle/resource_feed_microsoft_office_365_management_activity.go`). Validation is also present in new feed resources like hostname validation for Thinkst Canary (`chronicle/resource_feed_thinkst_canary.go`). This helps prevent some basic configuration errors.
    - Documentation for each feed resource in `docs/resources/feed_*.md` outlines the required and optional configurations, which guides users on correct setup. Example Usage sections are provided for each resource.
    - **Risk Severity Influence:** Medium. Input validation offers basic protection against simple errors. Documentation guides users, but complex configurations and subtle misconfigurations are still possible, and users might not fully understand the security implications of all settings.
  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Enhanced Configuration Validation:** Implement more comprehensive validation of feed configurations. This could include:
      - Validating URI formats against expected patterns more strictly.
      - Checking for potentially insecure configurations, such as allowing wildcard access or overly broad permissions in cloud storage or API access policies implied by the Terraform configuration.
      - Validating regions against allowed regions for services (e.g., AWS regions, Chronicle API regions).
    - **Example Configurations with Security Considerations:** Expand example configurations in documentation to explicitly include security best practices and considerations for each feed type. Highlight secure configuration options and warn against common misconfiguration pitfalls.
    - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scanning Tools Integration Guidance:** Recommend and provide guidance on using IaC scanning tools (like Checkov, tfsec, Snyk IaC) to automatically detect potential security misconfigurations in Terraform code before deployment.
    - **"Least Privilege" Configuration Guidance:** Emphasize the principle of least privilege in documentation. Guide users to configure feeds with the minimum necessary permissions and access rights to both the source systems and Chronicle.
  - **Risk severity:** Medium

- **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks during Credential or Log Data Transmission
  - **Description:** If communication channels used by the provider are not properly encrypted, attackers positioned on the network could intercept sensitive data in transit. This could include credentials transmitted from Terraform to the provider during configuration, credentials transmitted from the provider to Chronicle APIs or external services for authentication, or even the log data being ingested itself. While HTTPS is generally expected for API communication, vulnerabilities could arise from misconfigurations, lack of HTTPS enforcement in all communication paths, or reliance on insecure protocols for certain data sources if supported.
  - **Impact:** Medium. Credential compromise, unauthorized access to Chronicle and external services, potential interception and manipulation of ingested log data (though less likely to be the primary attack goal compared to credential theft).
  - **Affected component:** Provider's communication with Chronicle APIs and external services (`chronicle/provider.go`, `client/`), potentially data ingestion mechanisms for certain feed types if they involve direct network connections.
  - **Current mitigations:**
    - The provider likely uses HTTPS for communication with Chronicle APIs and external services as a standard security practice for API interactions. This is not explicitly stated in the provided files but is a common expectation for modern API clients.
    - **Risk Severity Influence:** Medium. Reliance on HTTPS provides a significant level of protection against MITM attacks for API communication. However, without explicit enforcement and checks, and depending on the security of underlying libraries and network configurations, vulnerabilities cannot be entirely ruled out.
  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Explicitly Enforce HTTPS for All API Communication:** Ensure that the provider code explicitly enforces HTTPS for all communication with Chronicle APIs and external services. This should be verified in the codebase (`client/` directory likely).
    - **TLS Configuration Review:** Review the TLS configuration used by the provider's HTTP client. Ensure it uses strong TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or higher) and cipher suites, and that it validates server certificates to prevent basic MITM attacks.
    - **Certificate Pinning (Optional, for High Security):** For highly sensitive deployments, consider implementing certificate pinning for communication with critical APIs. This adds an extra layer of defense against sophisticated MITM attacks involving compromised Certificate Authorities, but also increases operational complexity for certificate management.
  - **Risk severity:** Medium

- **Threat:** Replay Attacks on Access Tokens or API Keys
  - **Description:** If access tokens or API keys used for authentication are intercepted by an attacker (e.g., through network sniffing if HTTPS is not enforced, or by compromising a developer's machine or CI/CD system), and if these tokens are valid for an extended period or lack proper validation mechanisms, the attacker could replay these tokens to gain unauthorized access to Chronicle APIs or external services. This could occur even after the legitimate user's session has ended or the original configuration has been changed.
  - **Impact:** Medium. Unauthorized access to Chronicle and potentially external services. Attackers could use replayed tokens to perform actions within Chronicle, such as reading or modifying configurations, querying data, or potentially disrupting services.
  - **Affected component:** Authentication handling within the provider (`chronicle/provider.go`, `client/`), token management by Chronicle APIs and external services.
  - **Current mitigations:**
    - Token expiration and validation are primarily managed by the Chronicle API and the external services the provider integrates with (AWS, Azure, Okta, etc.), not directly by the provider itself. The security of token handling largely depends on these external systems' security practices.
    - The provider code (as seen in the configuration schema in `chronicle/provider.go`) accepts access tokens and credentials, suggesting it uses token-based authentication where applicable, which is generally more secure than static, long-lived API keys if tokens are properly managed.
    - **Risk Severity Influence:** Medium. Mitigation relies on the security of external systems' token management. If these systems use short-lived tokens and robust validation, the risk is reduced. However, the provider's handling of tokens and potential for replay attacks if tokens are compromised needs to be considered.
  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Encourage Short-Lived Access Tokens and API Keys (Documentation):** In documentation, explicitly recommend using the shortest practical expiration times for access tokens and API keys whenever configurable in Chronicle or external services. Guide users on how to configure token lifetimes if possible.
    - **Token Validation and Revocation Mechanisms (Provider-Side, if feasible):** Explore if the provider can implement any client-side token validation or revocation checks, although this is often handled server-side by the API. If feasible, add checks to detect and prevent token replay, but this is complex and might be beyond the scope of a Terraform provider.
    - **Promote OAuth 2.0 or More Robust Authentication Protocols:** If not already in use, advocate for and transition to more robust authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 with refresh tokens for API interactions where possible. OAuth 2.0 provides better token management, including refresh tokens for obtaining new short-lived access tokens and token revocation capabilities. Check if the Chronicle API and integrated services support OAuth 2.0 and if the provider can leverage it.
  - **Risk severity:** Medium

- **Threat:** Rule Misconfiguration Leading to Ineffective Detections or Performance Issues
  - **Description:** Incorrectly configured YARA-L rules through the `chronicle_rule` resource can lead to several negative security outcomes. Overly broad rules might generate excessive false positive alerts, overwhelming security teams and reducing the effectiveness of alerts. Conversely, too specific or poorly written rules might miss real threats (false negatives). Inefficient or computationally expensive rules could also negatively impact Chronicle's performance and increase processing costs.
  - **Impact:** Medium. Reduced security monitoring effectiveness due to false positives or negatives, potential performance degradation of Chronicle, increased operational overhead in managing alerts.
  - **Affected component:** `chronicle_rule` resource (`chronicle/resource_rule.go`), YARA-L rule engine within Chronicle.
  - **Current mitigations:**
    - The provider includes YARA-L rule text validation (`chronicle/validation.go`) using the Chronicle API's `VerifyYARARule` function. This helps to catch syntax errors and compilation issues before rule creation.
    - Documentation for the `chronicle_rule` resource should guide users on writing effective and efficient YARA-L rules.
    - **Risk Severity Influence:** Medium. Rule validation provides a basic level of protection against syntax errors. However, it does not prevent logical errors in rule design that lead to false positives/negatives or performance issues. User skill in writing YARA-L rules is a significant factor.
  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Enhanced Rule Validation and Testing Guidance:** Expand documentation to include best practices for writing effective YARA-L rules, including guidance on testing rules for false positives and negatives before deployment.
    - **Rule Performance Optimization Guidance:** Provide recommendations and best practices for writing efficient YARA-L rules to minimize performance impact on Chronicle.
    - **Integration with Rule Testing Frameworks (Future Enhancement):** Explore potential future integration with rule testing frameworks or linters that could provide more advanced static analysis and validation of YARA-L rules beyond basic syntax checks.
  - **Risk severity:** Medium

- **Threat:** RBAC Misconfiguration Leading to Unauthorized Access or Operational Disruption
  - **Description:** Misconfiguration of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) through the `chronicle_rbac_subject` resource could result in unintended access control issues. Granting overly broad roles to subjects (analysts or IDP groups) could lead to unauthorized data access or actions within Chronicle. Conversely, overly restrictive role assignments could hinder legitimate security operations and analyst workflows, causing operational disruptions.
  - **Impact:** Medium. Unauthorized access to sensitive Chronicle data or functionalities, operational disruptions for security teams, potential compliance violations due to inadequate access controls.
  - **Affected component:** `chronicle_rbac_subject` resource (`chronicle/resource_rbac_subject.go`), RBAC enforcement within Chronicle.
  - **Current mitigations:**
    - The provider allows management of RBAC subjects and role assignments, enabling users to define access control policies as code.
    - Documentation for the `chronicle_rbac_subject` resource should guide users on implementing least privilege principles when assigning roles.
    - **Risk Severity Influence:** Medium. The provider facilitates RBAC management, but the security posture depends heavily on the user's understanding and correct implementation of RBAC principles. Misconfiguration is possible if users are not familiar with RBAC best practices or the specific roles and permissions within Chronicle.
  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - **RBAC Best Practices Documentation:**  Enhance documentation to include detailed guidance on RBAC best practices for Chronicle, emphasizing the principle of least privilege and providing examples of common role assignments for different user types and security operations tasks.
    - **Role and Permission Introspection (Future Enhancement):**  Consider adding features (potentially through data sources in the provider) to allow users to introspect available roles and their associated permissions within Chronicle. This could help users make more informed decisions when assigning roles and reduce the risk of misconfiguration.
    - **IaC Scanning for RBAC Policies (Future Enhancement):** Explore integration with IaC scanning tools that can analyze Terraform configurations for RBAC policies and identify potential misconfigurations, such as overly permissive role assignments.
  - **Risk severity:** Medium
