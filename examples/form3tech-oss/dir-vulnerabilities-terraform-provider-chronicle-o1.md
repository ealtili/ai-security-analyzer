Below is the **complete vulnerability list** based on the provided project files. After analyzing the source code and configuration, **no new valid vulnerabilities** were found in this version of the code. The application appears to follow standard security practices (e.g., resource attributes containing secrets are marked as `Sensitive: true`, server communication occurs over standard HTTP/TLS libraries, user-supplied inputs are validated, etc.). Therefore, **no unmitigated vulnerabilities** that pose a real-world risk could be identified at this time.

Because no vulnerabilities have been discovered, **the list is empty**.
