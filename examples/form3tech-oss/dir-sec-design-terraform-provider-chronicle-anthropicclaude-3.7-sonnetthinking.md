# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Chronicle Terraform provider project enables infrastructure automation for Google Cloud's Chronicle security platform. The main business priorities of this project are:

1. Enable security operations teams to define, deploy, and manage Chronicle resources through infrastructure as code
2. Support various data ingestion methods (feeds) to consolidate security data from multiple sources
3. Provide a consistent, programmable interface for managing security rules, reference lists, and access controls
4. Improve operational efficiency by automating Chronicle resource management

Key business risks that need to be addressed:

1. API credential management and security
2. Consistency and reliability in resource state management
3. Compatibility with Chronicle API changes
4. Maintaining accurate documentation for complex feed configurations

# SECURITY POSTURE

## Existing Security Controls

- Security control: Credentials protection through sensitive attribute marking in schema definitions. Implemented in all authentication-related fields that contain secrets or access tokens.

- Security control: Token-based authentication through various API endpoints. Implemented in provider.go with multiple authentication options.

- Security control: Environment variable fallback for credentials, reducing hard-coded secrets in Terraform files. Implemented in provider configuration.

- Security control: Request timeout and retry parameters to prevent hanging connections. Implemented in client configuration.

- Security control: Region validation to ensure API endpoints are legitimate. Implemented in provider validation functions.

- Security control: Rate limiting in API clients to prevent abuse or throttling. Implemented via ClientRateLimiters in endpoints.go.

- Security control: Sensitive data handling for feed authentication credentials (e.g., Thinkst Canary tokens, Qualys VM credentials, AWS keys). Implemented in resource schemas with Sensitive: true attributes.

- Security control: Validation functions for resource property formats to prevent misconfiguration. Implemented with ValidateDiagFunc across resources.

- Accepted risk: The provider currently stores state containing resource identifiers in the Terraform state file.

## Recommended Security Controls

- Implement credential rotation capabilities within the provider
- Add support for AWS IAM role-based authentication instead of just access keys
- Implement logging with sensitive data filtering
- Add support for service account impersonation
- Add SAST scanning for YARA-L rule content to identify potentially harmful rules
- Implement resource tagging for easier security auditing and management
- Add detection rule testing simulation before enabling in production

## Security Requirements

### Authentication
- Support for multiple authentication methods (credentials, access tokens, environment variables)
- Secure handling of sensitive authentication data
- Validation of authentication parameters
- API-specific credential isolation (BigQuery, Backstory, Ingestion, Forwarder)

### Authorization
- Support for RBAC subject management
- Clear separation of responsibilities in resource access
- Role-based access control for Chronicle resources

### Input Validation
- Parameter validation for all resource configurations
- URI format validation for storage endpoints
- UUID format validation for tenant and client IDs
- Hostname format validation for service endpoints
- YARA-L rule syntax validation

### Cryptography
- TLS for all API communications
- Secure handling of encryption keys and tokens
- Protection of sensitive authentication data

## DEPLOYMENT

Chronicle Terraform Provider is deployed as part of the Terraform ecosystem. The provider is typically installed in one of two ways:

1. **Registry-based deployment**: The provider is published to the Terraform Registry and automatically downloaded by Terraform.
2. **Local development deployment**: For development or custom builds, the provider can be built locally and configured via a local plugin directory.

For this design document, we'll focus on the standard registry-based deployment which is the most common approach.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

## Critical Business Processes to Protect

1. **Credential Management**: The provider handles sensitive authentication credentials for Chronicle APIs. Protecting these credentials is essential to prevent unauthorized access to security data.

2. **Resource Provisioning**: The accurate and consistent provisioning of Chronicle resources is critical for security monitoring and operations.

3. **Data Feed Configuration**: Ensuring correct configuration of data feeds is essential for proper security monitoring and threat detection.

4. **Detection Rule Management**: The correct deployment and management of detection rules directly impacts an organization's security posture.

## Data to Protect

1. **API Credentials**: The provider handles various API credentials and access tokens. These have high sensitivity as they provide direct access to Chronicle.

2. **Feed Authentication Data**: The provider manages authentication details for various third-party systems. These have high sensitivity as they could provide access to external systems.

3. **Detection Rules**: YARA-L rules managed by the provider may contain sensitive information about an organization's detection capabilities and security practices. These have medium sensitivity.

4. **Reference Lists**: Lists managed by the provider might contain sensitive indicators or internal asset information. These have medium sensitivity.

5. **Resource IDs and Names**: The provider manages identifiers for various resources which might reveal information about the security infrastructure. These have low sensitivity.
