# BUSINESS POSTURE

Google Chronicle is a cloud-native security analytics platform designed to help organizations detect, investigate, and respond to cybersecurity threats. This Terraform provider enables infrastructure-as-code management of Chronicle resources, allowing security teams to automate the setup and configuration of data feeds, detection rules, access control, and reference lists.

The primary business priorities and goals include:

1. Enabling security teams to manage Chronicle resources through infrastructure-as-code practices
2. Automating the configuration of data ingestion feeds from various sources
3. Standardizing security controls and configurations across environments
4. Providing a consistent way to deploy and update security detection rules
5. Managing access control (RBAC) through code
6. Supporting various authentication methods for different Chronicle APIs

Key business risks that need to be addressed:

1. Credential exposure in Terraform state files and version control systems
2. Complexity in managing credential authorization for multiple APIs and data sources
3. Ensuring consistent security controls across different deployment environments
4. Maintaining version compatibility with the Chronicle API
5. Potential service disruption during updates or reconfigurations

# SECURITY POSTURE

## Existing Security Controls

- Security control: Sensitive field protection for credentials marked with `Sensitive: true` to prevent logging of sensitive values (implemented in all resource files containing authentication blocks, including `resource_feed_qualys_vm.go`, `resource_feed_thinkst_canary.go`)
- Security control: Multiple authentication methods including credential files and access tokens (implemented in provider.go)
- Security control: Environment variable fallback for credentials to avoid hardcoding in configuration files (implemented in provider.go)
- Security control: Region-specific endpoint configuration to ensure data locality compliance (implemented in provider.go)
- Security control: Resource-level timeout configuration to prevent long-running operations (implemented in all resource files)
- Security control: Validation functions for input parameters to prevent misconfiguration (implemented in validation.go)
- Security control: Rate limiting for API requests to prevent accidental DoS conditions (implemented in client/endpoints.go)
- Security control: Proper error handling with retry mechanisms (implemented in client/transport.go)
- Security control: Validation of YARA rules before submission to ensure proper format (implemented in resource_rule.go)
- Security control: Input validation for hostnames, authentication parameters, and other critical fields (implemented in validation.go)
- Accepted risk: Credentials stored in Terraform state files are not encrypted by default

## Recommended Security Controls

- Implement state file encryption or use remote state with encryption
- Add support for Workload Identity Federation authentication to avoid using static credentials
- Implement credential rotation capabilities
- Add comprehensive logging for security-relevant operations
- Add input validation for all custom parameters to prevent injection attacks
- Implement mutual TLS for API communication to enhance transport security

## Security Requirements

### Authentication
- Support for multiple authentication methods including service account keys and access tokens
- Clear separation of authentication contexts for different Chronicle APIs
- Secure storage of credentials (preferably using environment variables or credential files)
- Support for regional endpoints to meet data residency requirements

### Authorization
- Role-based access control for Chronicle resources
- Management of subjects (users/groups) and their roles
- Support for namespace-based resource segregation

### Input Validation
- Validation of all input parameters to prevent misconfiguration
- Format validation for identifiers, URIs, and configuration values
- Type checking for all input values
- Validation of YARA rules before deployment

### Cryptography
- Secure handling of authentication tokens and credentials
- Support for various authentication schemes including AWS IAM and Azure authentication
- Potential support for encryption of data in transit

    GR -->|triggers| GHA[GitHub Actions]

    subgraph "CI Pipeline"
    GHA -->|runs| LI[Lint Workflow]

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Critical Business Processes

1. **Security Data Ingestion**
   - Chronicle depends on reliable data ingestion from various sources
   - The provider manages feed configurations that determine what data is ingested
   - Misconfigurations could lead to missing security data or excessive costs

2. **Security Detection and Response**
   - Chronicle's ability to detect threats depends on properly configured rules
   - The provider manages rule deployments and updates
   - Errors in rule management could lead to missed detections or false positives

3. **Access Control and Permissions**
   - Chronicle requires proper access management for security
   - The provider manages RBAC subjects and their roles
   - Misconfiguration could lead to excessive privileges or access restrictions

### Data Protection

The provider handles various sensitive data types:

1. **Authentication Credentials**
   - Service account keys, access tokens, API credentials
   - High sensitivity - must be protected from exposure
   - Used to authenticate with Chronicle APIs

2. **Feed Configuration Details**
   - Connection information for various data sources
   - Medium to high sensitivity - reveals information about security infrastructure
   - Used to configure data ingestion

3. **Detection Rules**
   - Security detection logic
   - Medium sensitivity - reveals security monitoring strategy
   - Used to detect security threats

4. **Reference Lists**
   - Lists used in security detections
   - Medium sensitivity - reveals monitoring scope
   - Used to support detection rules
