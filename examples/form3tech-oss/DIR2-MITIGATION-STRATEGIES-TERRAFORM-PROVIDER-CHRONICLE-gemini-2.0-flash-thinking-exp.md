### Mitigation Strategies for terraform-provider-chronicle

Here are mitigation strategies to enhance the security of applications using the `terraform-provider-chronicle`. These strategies focus on threats specifically introduced by the provider and exclude general security practices.

* Mitigation Strategy: **Securely Manage Chronicle API Credentials and External Service Credentials**
    * Description:
        1. **Avoid Hardcoding:** Never hardcode API credentials (Chronicle, AWS, Azure, Okta, Proofpoint, Qualys, Thinkst Canary) directly in Terraform configuration files. This includes credentials for Chronicle APIs (BigQuery, Backstory, Ingestion, Forwarder) and external services like AWS S3 and SQS used in feed configurations, and Thinkst Canary API keys.
        2. **Utilize Terraform Variables:** Define variables for all sensitive credentials.
        3. **Secure Input of Variables:** Provide values for these variables through secure methods:
            * **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables (e.g., `TF_VAR_chronicle_backstory_credentials`, `TF_VAR_aws_secret_access_key`, `TF_VAR_thinkst_canary_api_key`). While convenient for local development, consider more secure options for production.
            * **Terraform Cloud/Enterprise Secrets:** Leverage the built-in secret management features of Terraform Cloud or Enterprise for storing and injecting secrets.
            * **External Secret Management Systems:** Integrate with external secret stores like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Secret Manager. While direct integration might require custom solutions outside of this provider, the secrets retrieved from these systems can be passed as Terraform variables.
            * **Credential Files:** Utilize credential files, referencing them via variables. Ensure these files are stored securely with appropriate file system permissions. Be mindful of the `pathOrContents` function in `client/util.go` which expands `~` in file paths, ensure the home directory and the credential file itself have restricted access.
        4. **Secure Terraform State:** Ensure Terraform state files are stored securely in a remote backend with appropriate access controls. Avoid storing state files in local file systems or committing them to version control, especially if they contain sensitive data (though sensitive attributes should be redacted).
    * Threats Mitigated:
        * **Hardcoded Credentials (High Severity):** Credentials directly embedded in configuration files can be easily exposed in version control systems, state files, and logs, leading to unauthorized access to Chronicle and integrated services, including Thinkst Canary.
    * Impact:
        * **Hardcoded Credentials:** Significantly reduces the risk of credential exposure by enforcing separation of configuration and sensitive values.
    * Currently Implemented:
        * Partially implemented. The documentation (`docs/index.md`) mentions the use of environment variables and different methods for providing credentials (access token or credentials file). The provider code (`client/client.go`) supports reading credentials from environment variables, JSON files, and access tokens. The `pathOrContents` function in `client/util.go` handles file path expansion for credential files.
    * Missing Implementation:
        * No enforcement within the provider itself to prevent hardcoding. The provider relies on user awareness and best practices.  Consider adding documentation warnings about the dangers of hardcoding credentials.

* Mitigation Strategy: **Mark Sensitive Attributes as Sensitive in Terraform Provider Schema**
    * Description:
        1. **Identify Sensitive Attributes:** Review the provider schema and identify all attributes that handle sensitive information such as API keys, secrets, passwords, and tokens. This includes:
            * Chronicle API credentials and access tokens (`backstoryapi_credentials`, `forwarderapi_access_token`, `ingestionapi_credentials`, `bigqueryapi_credentials`, `backstoryapi_access_token`, `ingestionapi_access_token`, `forwarderapi_access_token`).
            * AWS credentials for feed resources (`secret_access_key`, `sqs_secret_access_key`, `access_key_id`, `sqs_access_key_id`).
            * Azure Blob Storage credentials for feed resources (`shared_key`, `sas_token`).
            * Microsoft Office 365 Management Activity credentials for feed resources (`client_secret`).
            * Okta System Log and Okta Users credentials for feed resources (`value`).
            * Proofpoint SIEM credentials for feed resources (`secret`).
            * Qualys VM credentials for feed resources (`secret`).
            * Thinkst Canary credentials for feed resources (`value` in `authentication` block).
            * Potentially other attributes like API token `value`, shared keys `shared_key`, and passwords `password` in other resources (if any are added in the future).
        2. **Implement `Sensitive: true`:** In the provider code (Go files), ensure that the `Sensitive: true` attribute is set in the schema definition for all identified sensitive attributes.
        3. **Verify Redaction:** Test and verify that Terraform correctly redacts the values of these sensitive attributes in state files and debug logs.
    * Threats Mitigated:
        * **Exposure of Sensitive Credentials in State Files and Logs (Medium Severity):** Accidental exposure of credentials in Terraform state files or debug logs can lead to unauthorized access if these files are compromised or inadvertently shared.
    * Impact:
        * **Exposure of Sensitive Credentials in State Files and Logs:** Reduces the risk of accidental credential leaks by redacting sensitive information from state and logs, making them less valuable to attackers even if exposed.
    * Currently Implemented:
        * Partially implemented. Documentation for resources like `chronicle_feed_amazon_s3`, `chronicle_feed_amazon_sqs`, `chronicle_feed_azure_blobstore`, `chronicle_feed_okta_system_log`, `chronicle_feed_okta_users`, `chronicle_feed_proofpoint_siem`, `chronicle_feed_qualys_vm`, `chronicle_feed_thinkst_canary` indicates attributes like `secret_access_key`, `sqs_secret_access_key`, `secret`, `client_secret`, `value`, `shared_key`, `sas_token` are marked as `Sensitive` in the documentation, implying they should be in the schema. Code analysis of `resource_feed_amazon_s3.go` and `resource_feed_amazon_sqs.go` confirms `secret_access_key`, `sqs_secret_access_key` are marked as sensitive. Resource code for `resource_feed_azure_blobstore.go`, `resource_feed_microsoft_office_365_management_activity.go`, `resource_feed_okta_system_log.go`, `resource_feed_okta_users.go`, `resource_feed_proofpoint_siem.go`, `resource_feed_qualys_vm.go`, and `resource_feed_thinkst_canary.go` also marks `shared_key`, `sas_token`, `client_secret`, `value`, and `secret`, and `value` in `resource_feed_thinkst_canary.go` as sensitive.
    * Missing Implementation:
        * **Code Verification:**  Need to audit the provider's Go code to confirm that `Sensitive: true` is actually implemented in the schema for *all* attributes documented as sensitive and any other potentially sensitive attributes not explicitly documented, including Chronicle API credentials and access tokens defined in `provider.go`.

* Mitigation Strategy: **Discourage Insecure Credential Storage in Environment Variables for Production**
    * Description:
        1. **Enhance Documentation:** Update the provider documentation (`docs/index.md` and resource-specific documentation) to explicitly state that while environment variables are supported for providing credentials, they are **not recommended for production environments** due to security risks.
        2. **Explain Risks:** Clearly explain the security risks associated with environment variables, such as potential exposure through process listings, logging, and inheritance by child processes.
        3. **Promote Secure Alternatives:** Strongly recommend and promote the use of more secure secret management solutions like Terraform Cloud/Enterprise secrets or dedicated secret management systems (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) for production deployments.
        4. **Provide Best Practices Guidance:** Include guidance and best practices for secure credential management within Terraform and when using the `chronicle-provider-terraform`, emphasizing the principle of least privilege and secure storage.
    * Threats Mitigated:
        * **Insecure Credential Storage in Environment Variables (Medium Severity):** Relying solely on environment variables for production credential management increases the risk of exposure compared to dedicated secret management solutions.
    * Impact:
        * **Insecure Credential Storage in Environment Variables:** Encourages users to adopt more secure credential management practices, reducing the overall risk of credential compromise in production.
    * Currently Implemented:
        * Partially implemented. Documentation mentions environment variables as an option but lacks explicit warnings about security implications and strong recommendations for secure alternatives in production.
    * Missing Implementation:
        * **Documentation Enhancement:**  Documentation needs to be updated to include clear security warnings about using environment variables in production and provide strong recommendations and guidance for secure alternatives.

* Mitigation Strategy: **Enforce Principle of Least Privilege for RBAC Roles**
    * Description:
        1. **Document Granular Roles:** Ensure the documentation for the `chronicle_rbac_subject` resource clearly outlines the different available RBAC roles and their associated permissions within Chronicle.
        2. **Promote Least Privilege:**  Explicitly advise users in the documentation to adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning RBAC roles. Users should grant subjects only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their intended tasks.
        3. **Provide Role-Based Examples:** Include examples in the documentation demonstrating how to assign different roles based on various user personas and use cases, emphasizing the selection of the least privileged role.
        4. **Encourage Regular Role Review:** Recommend periodic reviews of RBAC role assignments to ensure they remain appropriate and aligned with the principle of least privilege as user responsibilities evolve.
    * Threats Mitigated:
        * **Overly Permissive RBAC Roles (Medium Severity):** Assigning overly broad RBAC roles can lead to unauthorized actions and data breaches if a subject is compromised or acts maliciously.
    * Impact:
        * **Overly Permissive RBAC Roles:** Reduces the risk of unauthorized actions by limiting the permissions granted to subjects, minimizing the potential impact of a compromise.
    * Currently Implemented:
        * Partially implemented. The `chronicle_rbac_subject` resource exists, and documentation (`docs/resources/rbac_subject.md`) describes its usage.
    * Missing Implementation:
        * **Documentation Enhancement:** Documentation should be expanded to explicitly emphasize and guide users on implementing the principle of least privilege when managing RBAC roles.  Adding examples and best practices would be beneficial.

* Mitigation Strategy: **Disable Debug Mode in Production Environments**
    * Description:
        1. **Document Debug Mode Usage:** Clearly document in the `README.md` and potentially in the provider documentation that the debug mode (enabled via the `-debug` flag or `debug.sh` script) is strictly intended for development and debugging purposes only.
        2. **Warn Against Production Use:** Explicitly warn against enabling debug mode in production environments due to potential security risks (verbose logging, exposure of debugging interfaces) and performance overhead.
        3. **Remove Debug Script from Production Deployments:** Ensure that the `debug.sh` script and any other debug-related scripts or configurations are not deployed or accessible in production environments.
        4. **Conditional Debug Code Compilation (Optional):** For enhanced security, consider using build flags or conditional compilation to completely exclude debug-related code and functionalities from production builds of the provider.
    * Threats Mitigated:
        * **Debug Mode Enabled in Production (Medium Severity):** Running the provider in debug mode in production can expose sensitive information through verbose logging, potentially reveal internal workings, and introduce performance vulnerabilities.
    * Impact:
        * **Debug Mode Enabled in Production:** Prevents potential information leakage and performance degradation in production by ensuring debug mode is disabled and debug-related tools are not accessible.
    * Currently Implemented:
        * Debug mode functionality exists in the code (`main.go`) and a debug script (`debug.sh`) is provided.
    * Missing Implementation:
        * **Documentation Warning:** Documentation should be enhanced to include a clear and prominent warning against using debug mode in production.
        * **Production Build Hardening (Optional):** Consider removing or disabling debug capabilities in production builds to prevent accidental or malicious enabling.

* Mitigation Strategy: **Validate Custom Endpoint URLs**
    * Description:
        1. **Implement URL Validation:** In the provider code (`provider.go` and `validation.go`), implement robust validation for all custom endpoint URLs (`events_custom_endpoint`, `alert_custom_endpoint`, etc.) before using them to configure the Chronicle client.
        2. **Use URL Parsing Libraries:** Utilize standard URL parsing libraries in Go (like `net/url`) to validate the format and structure of the provided URLs. The `validateCustomEndpoint` function in `validation.go` uses `url.ParseRequestURI`.
        3. **Restrict Allowed Schemes:**  Ensure that only `https://` scheme is allowed for custom endpoints to enforce encrypted communication. Reject `http://` or other schemes.
        4. **Prevent Private Network Access (Optional but Recommended):** If feasible and applicable to the provider's use case, consider implementing checks to prevent custom endpoints from resolving to private network addresses, mitigating potential SSRF-like risks.
    * Threats Mitigated:
        * **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks via Custom Endpoints (Medium to High Severity):** If custom endpoints are not validated and only `http` is allowed, attackers could potentially intercept communication. Allowing arbitrary URLs without validation could also lead to users inadvertently connecting to malicious endpoints.
        * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Custom Endpoints (Low to Medium Severity):** In certain scenarios, if validation is weak or non-existent, attackers might be able to manipulate custom endpoints to point to internal resources, potentially leading to SSRF vulnerabilities (depending on the Chronicle API implementation and network configuration, this might be less relevant, but validation is still crucial for preventing MITM).
    * Impact:
        * **Man-in-the-Middle and SSRF:** Significantly reduces the risk of MITM attacks and potential SSRF vulnerabilities by ensuring that custom endpoints are valid HTTPS URLs and preventing connections to unintended or malicious servers.
    * Currently Implemented:
        * Partially implemented. The `validation.go` file includes `validateCustomEndpoint` function which uses `url.ParseRequestURI` for validation.
    * Missing Implementation:
        * **Scheme Restriction and Private Network Prevention:** The current `validateCustomEndpoint` function using `url.ParseRequestURI` validates the URL format but doesn't explicitly restrict schemes to `https://` or prevent private network access. The validation should be enhanced to enforce `https://` scheme and ideally include checks to prevent resolving to private IPs. Code in `validation.go` needs to be updated to include these checks.

* Mitigation Strategy: **Validate Input for Rule Text, Hostnames and Content Types**
    * Description:
        1. **Implement Input Validation:** In the provider code (`validation.go`, and resource files), implement validation functions (`validateRuleText`, `validateThinkstCanaryHostname`, `validateReferenceListContentType`) for resource attributes that take user-provided text, hostnames or content types.
        2. **Rule Text Validation (`validateRuleText`):** Ensure that the `validateRuleText` function performs comprehensive validation of the YARA-L 2.0 rule text to prevent injection attacks or rule parsing vulnerabilities. The current implementation in `validation.go` only checks if the rule text ends with a newline. This should be enhanced to include syntax checking and potentially checks for malicious or unexpected rule logic. Leverage the `client.VerifyYARARule` function for server-side validation, which is already used in `resource_rule.go`.  When using `file()` function to provide `rule_text` as shown in `examples/resources/detection/rule/main.tf`, ensure the rule file itself is securely stored and access-controlled to prevent modification by unauthorized users.
        3. **Hostname Validation (`validateThinkstCanaryHostname`):** Implement `validateThinkstCanaryHostname` to validate the format and structure of the Thinkst Canary hostname. The current implementation in `validation.go` uses regex `^.*\.canary\.tools$`. This regex validation seems reasonable for ensuring the hostname is in the expected domain.
        4. **Content Type Validation (`validateReferenceListContentType`):** Implement `validateReferenceListContentType` to ensure that the provided content type for reference lists is one of the allowed values (`CONTENT_TYPE_DEFAULT_STRING`, `REGEX`, `CIDR`). The current implementation in `validation.go` checks against a hardcoded list of allowed content types, which is good.
        5. **Error Handling:** Ensure that validation functions return informative error messages to guide users in correcting invalid inputs. The existing validation functions in `validation.go` use `diag.FromErr` to return errors, which is the correct approach.
    * Threats Mitigated:
        * **Rule Injection/Parsing Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):**  Lack of proper validation for `rule_text` could allow attackers to inject malicious YARA-L rules that could bypass security measures or cause unexpected behavior in Chronicle.
        * **Invalid Hostname Configuration (Low Severity):**  Invalid hostnames in `chronicle_feed_thinkst_canary` could lead to feed configuration errors and denial of service.
        * **Incorrect Reference List Configuration (Low Severity):** Invalid `content_type` in `chronicle_reference_list` could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in reference list usage.
    * Impact:
        * **Rule Injection/Parsing Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces the risk of rule injection and parsing vulnerabilities by ensuring that only valid and safe YARA-L rules are accepted.
        * **Invalid Hostname and Reference List Configuration:** Prevents configuration errors and improves the reliability of the provider.
    * Currently Implemented:
        * Partially implemented. Validation functions `validateRuleText`, `validateThinkstCanaryHostname`, and `validateReferenceListContentType` are implemented in `validation.go`. `resource_rule.go` uses `client.VerifyYARARule` for server-side validation of rule text. `validateThinkstCanaryHostname` uses regex for hostname validation. `validateReferenceListContentType` checks against allowed content types.
    * Missing Implementation:
        * **Enhanced Rule Text Validation:** The `validateRuleText` function in `validation.go` needs to be significantly enhanced to perform more robust validation of YARA-L rules beyond just checking for a newline. This should include client-side syntax checks and potentially more advanced validation logic. While server-side validation using `client.VerifyYARARule` is used, client-side validation can provide faster feedback to users and reduce unnecessary API calls.
