# Threat Modeling Analysis for Terraform Chronicle Provider Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

**Project Name:** terraform-provider-chronicle

### Overview

This Terraform provider manages Google Chronicle resources. It allows users to configure “feeds” (collection pipelines from external data sources), create and update Chronicle detection rules, manage RBAC subjects, and store reference lists in Chronicle. The provider interacts with various Chronicle APIs for data ingestion, threat detection, and role/permission management.

### Key Components and Features

1. **Feed Resources**
   - Multiple feed types (Amazon S3, Amazon SQS, Azure Blobstore, Google Cloud Storage Bucket, and various API-based feeds).
   - Each feed often requires credentials (e.g., AWS access keys or secrets) or tokens.

2. **Detection Rule Management**
   - Create/update YARA-L-based rules in Chronicle.
   - Integrates with Chronicle’s rule compilation and verification endpoints.

3. **RBAC Subject Management**
   - Create, update, or delete Chronicle “subjects” (users or groups) and assign them roles.

4. **Reference Lists**
   - Store lists of values (e.g., IP addresses, patterns, etc.) in Chronicle to be used in detection rules or correlation.

### Typical Use Cases

- Security teams or DevOps teams automate Chronicle configuration with Terraform.
- Programmatically define data feeds from cloud storage, message queues, or third-party APIs.
- Manage large sets of detection rules or reference lists in code instead of manually through a UI.

### Dependencies

- Written with the [Terraform Plugin SDK v2](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk).
- Interacts with Google Chronicle endpoints via HTTP/REST.
- Pulls credentials from environment variables, local JSON files, or direct token content.

## 2. Define the Root Goal of the Attack Tree

**Root Goal:** An attacker aims to compromise organizations’ Chronicle configurations (and potentially the broader environment) by exploiting weaknesses introduced specifically by the Terraform Chronicle Provider.

---

## 3. Identify High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)

1. **Sub-Goal A:** Deploy or inject a malicious or altered version of the provider to users (“Supply Chain” or “Plugin Tampering”).
2. **Sub-Goal B:** Extract or misuse credentials that the provider handles (e.g., from environment variables, partial logging, or Terraform state).
3. **Sub-Goal C:** Manipulate feed or rule configurations through the provider in ways that allow unauthorized data access or subtle data exfiltration.

---

## 4. Expand Each Attack Path with Detailed Steps

### Sub-Goal A: Malicious Provider Distribution

- **A1: Host a Trojanized Binary**
  - [OR] (A1.1) Attacker publishes a similarly named plugin on a public registry or GitHub, tricking users into installing it.
  - [OR] (A1.2) Attacker compromises the official distribution channel or release process (e.g., modifies the GitHub release workflow) to insert malicious code.

- **A2: Altered Goreleaser or Build Pipeline**
  - [OR] (A2.1) Attacker modifies `goreleaser.yaml` or GitHub Actions definitions (e.g., `.github/workflows/release.yaml`) to inject malicious steps that produce tampered binaries.

### Sub-Goal B: Credential Leakage or Misuse

- **B1: Leaking Secrets in Terraform State**
  - [AND] (B1.1) The provider code marks some sensitive fields as non-sensitive, leading them to appear in Terraform state.
  - [AND] (B1.2) The user inadvertently commits the state file to version control, exposing keys that the attacker can use.

- **B2: Logging of Sensitive Data**
  - [OR] (B2.1) Debug logs from the plugin or GitHub Actions inadvertently include environment variables or token values.
  - [OR] (B2.2) Overly verbose error handling (e.g., using `log.Printf`) includes secret fields.

- **B3: Environment Variable Injection**
  - [AND] (B3.1) The attacker has local or CI/CD environment access and can overwrite environment variables (e.g., `CHRONICLE_*_CREDENTIALS`), causing the plugin to push or pull attacker-chosen credentials.
  - [AND] (B3.2) The attacker reconfigures or hijacks Terraform runs to use these malicious credentials or tokens.

### Sub-Goal C: Malicious Config Manipulation

- **C1: Unapproved Feed Reconfiguration**
  - [OR] (C1.1) Attacker modifies feed settings in `.tf` code or overrides them during Terraform apply, causing logs or data from valuable sources to be forwarded to an attacker-controlled endpoint.
  - [OR] (C1.2) Attacker sets `source_delete_options` to remove original logs from storage prematurely, impeding forensics.

- **C2: Injecting Malicious Chronicle Rules**
  - [AND] (C2.1) Attacker modifies YARA-L `rule_text` so that detection is silently removed or false positives are generated, hiding attacker activity.
  - [AND] (C2.2) The plugin pushes that rule to Chronicle, effectively reducing security coverage.

## 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

1. **Trojanized Plugin (A1)**
   - **Justification:** A compromised build or tampered download leads to complete attacker control. Though less likely than simpler credential leaks, the potential impact is extreme.

2. **Credentials in State or Logs (B1 & B2)**
   - **Justification:** Credential leakage is comparatively easier and can quickly lead to direct Chronicle access. Many Terraform setups inadvertently commit state files if not carefully managed.

3. **Malicious Rule or Feed Reconfig (C1 & C2)**
   - **Justification:** If the attacker can push changes to feed or detection configurations, they can redirect logs or remove detection rules. This is somewhat harder but can be devastating if successful.

---

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies

Below are example mitigations specific to this project’s code or functionality (not generic global best practices):

1. **Code/Build Integrity for Distribution (Addresses A1)**
   - Sign release artifacts in the existing `goreleaser` workflow.
   - Validate checksums or signatures during plugin installation.

2. **Sensitive Field Handling (Addresses B1, B2)**
   - Double-check each resource’s Terraform schema for `Sensitive: true` as needed (e.g., "secret_access_key", "client_secret").
   - Ensure no log.Printf statements reveal these fields.

3. **Credential Injection Protection (Addresses B3)**
   - Provide an explicit warning in docs that environment variables override local credentials.
   - Offer optional validation against known suspicious tokens (e.g., prevent obviously incorrect tokens).

4. **Feed Configuration Validation (Addresses C1)**
   - Consider provider-side checks preventing obviously malicious endpoints or broad usage of “source_delete_options.”
   - Possibly add an “approval” step or user confirmation for destructive feed configurations (like deleting source logs).

5. **Rule Integrity Checks (Addresses C2)**
   - Where feasible, detect if the user’s `rule_text` drastically modifies coverage (e.g., removing all detection conditions).
   - Possibly parse the YARA-L in the plugin for suspicious patterns before sending to Chronicle.

---

## 9. Summarize Findings

1. **Key Risks Identified**
   - Supply chain tampering with distributed binaries.
   - Credentials inadvertently logged or stored in Terraform state.
   - Misconfigurations for feeds or detection rules that allow exfiltration or hide attacker activity.

2. **Recommended Actions**
   - Implement signed releases to ensure plugin integrity.
   - Fully mark and review sensitive fields in Terraform schemas.
   - Add or enhance validation logic to catch suspicious feed or rule configurations.

---

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

1. **Questions**
   - Does the provider’s debug mode ever print full credentials to logs?
   - How frequently are releases and checksums validated by end users?

2. **Assumptions**
   - End users rely on official GitHub binary releases or the Terraform registry, but do not always verify signatures.
   - Basic environment security is in place (e.g., minimal local tampering with environment variables).
