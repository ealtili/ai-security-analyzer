# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
    - Goal: To provide users with a Terraform provider for managing Google Chronicle resources.
    - Priority: Enable Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for Chronicle deployments, allowing for automated and repeatable management of security logging and analytics infrastructure.
    - Goal: Simplify the management of Chronicle resources, making it easier for security and operations teams to adopt and utilize Chronicle effectively.
- Business Risks:
    - Risk of misconfiguration of Chronicle resources through the Terraform provider, potentially leading to security gaps or operational issues in Chronicle deployments.
    - Risk of exposing sensitive credentials or configuration details if the Terraform provider or its configurations are not securely managed.
    - Risk of provider vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise Chronicle environments managed by Terraform.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
    - security control: Authentication to Chronicle APIs is handled through credentials (service account keys) or access tokens, as configured in the Terraform provider. Described in: `docs\index.md`.
    - security control: Secure handling of sensitive data using Terraform's sensitive attribute for credentials and API tokens. Implemented in: provider code and resource schemas.
    - security control: Input validation within the Terraform provider code to ensure proper configuration of Chronicle resources. Implemented in: provider code, e.g., `chronicle\resource_feed_amazon_s3.go` - `validateFeedS3SourceType`.
    - security control: CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated building, testing, and releasing of the Terraform provider. Implemented in: `.github\workflows\ci.yaml`, `.github\workflows\release.yaml`.
    - security control: Code quality checks including linting and formatting enforced through GitHub Actions. Implemented in: `.github\workflows\lint.yaml`, `scripts\gofmtcheck.sh`.
    - security control: Input validation in resource definitions using `ValidateDiagFunc`. Implemented in: resource definition files, e.g. `chronicle\resource_feed_thinkst_canary.go`, `chronicle\resource_rule.go`.
- Accepted Risks:
    - accepted risk: Reliance on users to securely manage their Chronicle credentials and Terraform state files.
    - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party Go libraries used by the Terraform provider.
- Recommended Security Controls:
    - security control: Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to automatically scan the Terraform provider code for potential vulnerabilities.
    - security control: Implement Dependency Scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in the provider's dependencies.
    - security control: Enhance supply chain security by signing provider releases and verifying dependencies.
    - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Terraform provider and its usage patterns.
- Security Requirements:
    - Authentication:
        - Requirement: The provider must securely authenticate to Chronicle APIs using various methods (credentials, access tokens).
        - Requirement: Support secure storage and handling of API credentials within Terraform configurations, leveraging Terraform's state management and sensitive attributes.
    - Authorization:
        - Requirement: Ensure that the Terraform provider operations are authorized against Chronicle's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to prevent unauthorized resource manipulation.
        - Requirement: Document the necessary Chronicle RBAC permissions required for the Terraform provider to function correctly.
    - Input Validation:
        - Requirement: Implement robust input validation for all resource attributes to prevent misconfigurations and potential injection vulnerabilities.
        - Requirement: Validate API responses to handle unexpected data and errors gracefully.
    - Cryptography:
        - Requirement: While direct cryptography within the provider might be limited, ensure sensitive data like credentials are handled as `sensitive` within Terraform to leverage Terraform's state encryption.
        - Requirement: Recommend and document best practices for users to manage sensitive data in Terraform, such as using backend state encryption and secret management tools.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
    - Ingestion of security logs into Chronicle for analysis and threat detection.
    - Definition and management of detection rules in Chronicle.
    - Management of user access and permissions within Chronicle.
- Data to Protect:
    - Sensitive Data:
        - Chronicle API credentials (service account keys, API tokens) - High sensitivity. Compromise could lead to unauthorized access and control over Chronicle instance.
        - User-provided credentials for external log sources (AWS, Azure, Okta, etc.) stored in Terraform configurations - High sensitivity. Compromise could lead to unauthorized access to external systems.
    - Other Data:
        - Terraform state files - Medium sensitivity. May contain configuration details and resource IDs, but sensitive credentials should be marked as sensitive.
        - Terraform provider code and build artifacts - Medium sensitivity. Potential supply chain risk if compromised, but primarily code and binaries.
