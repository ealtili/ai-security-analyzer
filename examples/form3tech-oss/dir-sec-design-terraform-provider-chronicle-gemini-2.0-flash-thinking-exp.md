# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
    - The primary goal of the Terraform Chronicle provider is to enable users to manage and automate the configuration of their Chronicle security analytics platform using Terraform.
    - This automation aims to streamline the deployment and management of Chronicle resources, such as data feeds, detection rules, and access controls.
    - By providing an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) approach, the provider seeks to improve consistency, repeatability, and auditability of Chronicle configurations.
    - The provider is intended to simplify the integration of Chronicle into existing DevOps workflows and infrastructure management practices.

- Business Risks:
    - Risk of misconfiguration: Incorrectly configured Chronicle resources through Terraform could lead to gaps in security monitoring, data ingestion failures, or ineffective threat detection.
    - Credential exposure: Improper handling or storage of Chronicle API credentials within Terraform configurations or state files could lead to unauthorized access to the Chronicle platform.
    - Provider reliability and stability: Bugs or vulnerabilities in the Terraform provider itself could disrupt Chronicle operations or introduce security weaknesses.
    - Adoption risk: Low adoption of the provider if it is not user-friendly, feature-rich, or well-documented, hindering the intended automation benefits.
    - Compatibility risk: Potential incompatibility issues with future versions of Terraform or Chronicle API changes could require ongoing maintenance and updates to the provider.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
    - security control: Credential management for Chronicle APIs (Backstory, BigQuery, Ingestion, Forwarder) is handled through Terraform provider configuration, supporting credentials file, access token, and environment variables. Described in `docs/index.md`.
    - security control: Sensitive credentials like `secret_access_key`, `client_secret`, `shared_key`, `sas_token`, and API tokens are marked as `Sensitive` in the Terraform schema. Implemented in resource schemas like `resource_feed_amazon_s3.go`, `resource_feed_amazon_sqs.go`, `resource_feed_azure_blobstore.go`, `resource_feed_microsoft_office_365_management_activity.go`, `resource_feed_okta_system_log.go`, `resource_feed_okta_users.go`, `resource_feed_proofpoint_siem.go`, `resource_feed_qualys_vm.go`, `resource_feed_thinkst_canary.go`.
    - security control: Input validation for region parameter to ensure it's within the allowed regions. Implemented in `chronicle/provider.go` and `chronicle/validation_helper.go`.

    - security control: Checksum verification for releases using SHA256. Configured in `goreleaser.yaml`.

- Accepted Risks:
    - accepted risk: Users are responsible for securely managing Terraform state files, which may contain sensitive configuration data, including credentials if not using external secret management.
    - accepted risk: Users are responsible for following security best practices when writing Terraform configurations, such as avoiding hardcoding sensitive credentials directly in code where possible.
    - accepted risk: Reliance on the security of underlying cloud provider APIs (Chronicle, AWS, Azure, GCP, Okta, Proofpoint, Qualys, Thinkst Canary, Microsoft Office 365) for data ingestion and resource management.

- Recommended Security Controls:
    - security control: Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan the provider code for potential security vulnerabilities before release.
    - security control: Integrate Dependency Scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline to identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in the provider's dependencies.
    - security control: Add Credential Scanning to the CI/CD pipeline to prevent accidental commit of credentials or secrets in the code.
    - security control: Provide comprehensive documentation with security best practices for users, including guidance on secure credential management (e.g., using Terraform Cloud Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, or cloud provider secret management services), secure state file storage, and principle of least privilege.
    - security control: Encourage and facilitate community security audits and vulnerability reporting processes.

- Security Requirements:
    - Authentication:
        - Requirement: The provider must securely authenticate to the Chronicle APIs using configured credentials or access tokens.
        - Existing Controls: Supports credentials and access tokens for API authentication.
        - Recommended Controls: Follow best practices for secure API authentication in Go, avoid storing credentials in memory longer than necessary.
    - Authorization:
        - Requirement: Provider actions must be authorized by Chronicle's RBAC system based on the credentials used for authentication.
        - Existing Controls: Relies on Chronicle API's authorization mechanisms.
        - Recommended Controls:  Document required Chronicle RBAC roles for different provider operations (e.g., creating feeds, rules, subjects).
    - Input Validation:
        - Requirement: All user-provided inputs must be validated to prevent injection attacks and misconfigurations.
        - Existing Controls: Input validation for region, custom endpoints, AWS keys, GCS URI, Azure Blobstore source type and delete options, Microsoft Office 365 content type, and UUIDs, Thinkst Canary Hostname, AWS Account ID, Reference List Content Type, Rule Text new line ending, Subject Type, Feed S3/GCS/Azure Blob Store Source Delete Options and Source Types.
        - Recommended Controls:  Strengthen input validation for all resource properties, especially those that interact with external systems (URIs, hostnames, etc.). Consider using schema-based validation to ensure data types and formats are correct.
    - Cryptography:
        - Requirement: Sensitive data at rest (in state) and in transit should be protected using encryption.
        - Existing Controls: Sensitive data marked in schema, HTTPS for API communication (assumed).
        - Recommended Controls:  Ensure that Terraform state backend is configured to encrypt sensitive data at rest. Document the importance of using HTTPS for all communication with Chronicle and external services.

    - Maintaining reference lists for threat intelligence and context enrichment within Chronicle.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
    - Chronicle API Credentials (BigQuery, Backstory, Ingestion, Forwarder): High sensitivity. Compromise could lead to unauthorized access to Chronicle platform and data.
    - Credentials for external systems (AWS, Azure, GCP, Okta, Proofpoint, Qualys, Thinkst Canary, Microsoft Office 365) used for data ingestion: High sensitivity. Compromise could lead to unauthorized access to external systems and data.
    - Terraform State Files: Medium sensitivity. May contain configuration details and potentially credentials if not managed externally.
    - Chronicle Rule definitions (YARA-L code): Medium sensitivity. May contain detection logic that could be valuable to attackers if exposed.
    - Reference Lists content: Low to Medium sensitivity. Sensitivity depends on the nature of the data in the lists (e.g., IP addresses, domain names, usernames).
    - RBAC Subject and Role assignments: Low to Medium sensitivity. Improper configuration could lead to unauthorized access within Chronicle.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE:
    - Question: What is the expected level of adoption for this Terraform provider within the target user base? Assumption: Moderate to high adoption, driven by the need for automation and IaC for security operations.
    - Question: Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA) that the provider needs to adhere to? Assumption: General security best practices are sufficient initially, with potential for compliance-specific features if required by user demand.
    - Question: What is the acceptable level of effort for ongoing maintenance and feature updates for the provider? Assumption: Ongoing maintenance and regular updates are expected to address bugs, security vulnerabilities, and API changes in Chronicle and integrated systems.

- SECURITY POSTURE:
    - Question: What are the user's security maturity levels and their understanding of IaC security best practices? Assumption: Users have a basic understanding of security principles but may need guidance on applying them within Terraform and the provider context.
    - Question: What are the preferred methods for users to manage sensitive credentials when using the provider? Assumption: Users will utilize a variety of methods, including environment variables, Terraform Cloud Secrets, and external secret management solutions. The provider should support and document these options.
    - Question: What level of security testing and code review is required for provider releases? Assumption: Regular security testing (SAST, dependency scanning) and code reviews by at least two developers are necessary before each release.

- DESIGN:
    - Question: What are the expected performance and scalability requirements for the provider? Assumption: The provider's performance should be comparable to other Terraform providers and scale adequately to manage typical Chronicle deployments. Performance testing and optimization may be needed in future iterations.
    - Question: Are there specific deployment environments or constraints that the provider needs to support? Assumption: The provider should be compatible with standard Terraform deployment environments (local CLI, Terraform Cloud, CI/CD pipelines) and common operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows).
    - Question: What level of logging and auditing is required within the provider itself? Assumption: Basic logging for debugging and error reporting is sufficient initially. More detailed auditing may be considered based on user feedback and security requirements.
