# Mitigation Strategies

## 1. Secure Credential Handling and Storage

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Utilize environment variables or credential managers for sensitive information.

- **Description**: Instead of hardcoding authentication credentials in Terraform configuration files, users should store credentials in environment variables (as supported by the provider), secure credential stores, or leverage cloud provider identity services. The provider should document and encourage this approach in all examples.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Exposure of sensitive credentials in source code repositories (High severity)
  - Credential leakage through shared configuration files (High severity)

- **Impact**: Significantly reduces the risk of credential exposure in source repositories, logs, and history. Centralizes credential management and makes rotation easier.

- **Currently Implemented**: Partially. The provider supports environment variables (CHRONICLE_BACKSTORY_CREDENTIALS, CHRONICLE_BIGQUERY_CREDENTIALS, etc.) and allows credential files as input. Authentication credentials are marked as sensitive in schema definitions (e.g., in ThinkstCanary, QualysVM, and other feed types).

- **Missing Implementation**: Need to emphasize environment variable usage in documentation and examples. Add warnings about hardcoded credentials in configuration files. The example configurations still show placeholder credentials (e.g., "XXXXX") that should be replaced with environment variable references.

## 2. Terraform State Encryption

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Implement state file encryption and remote state storage.

- **Description**: Configure Terraform to use encrypted remote state storage (like S3 with server-side encryption, GCS with encryption, or Terraform Cloud) instead of local state files. All sensitive values should be marked as sensitive in the schema definition.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Exposure of credentials and sensitive data in plaintext Terraform state files (High severity)
  - Unauthorized access to infrastructure secrets (High severity)

- **Impact**: Prevents exposure of sensitive credentials even if state files are accidentally shared or accessed by unauthorized users.

- **Currently Implemented**: Partially. The provider correctly marks sensitive fields in schema definitions (e.g., authentication values, tokens, secrets) which helps protect them in logs, but state file encryption depends on user configuration.

- **Missing Implementation**: Documentation should emphasize the importance of remote encrypted state and provide examples of secure state configuration with the Chronicle provider.

## 3. Enhanced Authentication Validation

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Implement comprehensive input validation for authentication credentials.

- **Description**: Add strict validation for all credential inputs to ensure they match expected formats (AWS key length and format, token formatting, etc.) and reject obviously invalid credentials early.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Injection attacks through malformed credentials (Medium severity)
  - Configuration errors leading to authentication failures (Medium severity)

- **Impact**: Reduces the risk of injection attacks and helps users identify configuration errors before deployment.

- **Currently Implemented**: Significantly implemented. Validation exists for various credential types including AWS access keys (`validateAWSAccessKeyID`, `validateAWSSecretAccessKey`), Thinkst Canary hostnames (`validateThinkstCanaryHostname`), and custom endpoints (`validateCustomEndpoint`).

- **Missing Implementation**: Validation for some credential types could be more comprehensive. Add specific format validation for additional authentication types like OAuth tokens and API keys.

## 4. Secure Feed Configuration Defaults

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Provide secure defaults for feed configurations.

- **Description**: Configure feed resources with secure defaults such as disabling deletion options by default, enabling minimal required permissions, and implementing secure connection settings.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Accidental data loss from misconfigured deletion options (High severity)
  - Overly permissive access to data sources (Medium severity)

- **Impact**: Prevents accidental data deletion and reduces the risk of data exposure through overly permissive configurations.

- **Currently Implemented**: Partially. Secure defaults exist for several feed types, like Azure Blobstore's `SOURCE_DELETION_NEVER` default. Validation functions like `validateFeedS3SourceDeleteOption`, `validateFeedGCSSourceDeleteOption`, and `validateFeedAzureBlobStoreSourceDeleteOption` help ensure valid deletion settings.

- **Missing Implementation**: Explicit secure defaults for all deletion options, comprehensive documentation on secure configuration options, and warnings for potentially destructive settings across all feed types.

## 5. Support for Temporary or Role-based Credentials

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Implement support for temporary credentials and role-based authentication.

- **Description**: Extend the provider to support short-lived credentials, token exchange mechanisms, or role-based authentication with cloud providers (AWS IAM roles, Azure Managed Identities, GCP service accounts).

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Risks associated with long-term credential exposure (High severity)
  - Credential rotation challenges (Medium severity)

- **Impact**: Reduces the security impact of credential compromise by limiting the validity period. Simplifies credential management and rotation.

- **Currently Implemented**: Limited. The provider primarily uses static credentials via access keys, shared keys, and API tokens. The RBAC subject resource supports role-based access control within Chronicle, but not for authenticating with external services.

- **Missing Implementation**: Support for AWS STS temporary credentials, Azure managed identities, GCP service account impersonation, and OAuth token refresh mechanisms.

## 6. TLS Enforcement for API Connections

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Enforce TLS for all external API connections.

- **Description**: Ensure all connections to external services (Chronicle APIs, cloud storage providers) use TLS with proper certificate validation and modern cipher suites.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Man-in-the-middle attacks on API traffic (High severity)
  - Data interception during transmission (High severity)

- **Impact**: Protects confidentiality and integrity of data and credentials in transit.

- **Currently Implemented**: Partially. The client uses HTTPS URLs for all service endpoints by default (via `getBasePathFromDomainsAndPath`), but there's no explicit TLS version enforcement or certificate validation visible in the code.

- **Missing Implementation**: Explicit TLS enforcement for all connections, certificate validation checks, and rejection of insecure connections. Clear documentation about minimum TLS version requirements.

## 7. Least Privilege Access Documentation

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Document least privilege access requirements for each resource.

- **Description**: Provide detailed documentation on the minimal set of permissions required for each resource type and examples of IAM policies following least privilege principles.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Overly permissive IAM configurations (Medium severity)
  - Unnecessary access to sensitive data (Medium severity)

- **Impact**: Helps users configure minimal necessary permissions, reducing the potential impact of credential compromise.

- **Currently Implemented**: Not clearly visible in the provided code. The provider has RBAC subject management capabilities, but doesn't include guidance on least privilege policies.

- **Missing Implementation**: Comprehensive documentation of required permissions for each feed type, rule management, and example IAM policies following least privilege principles.

## 8. Secure Deletion Management

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Implement safeguards for deletion operations.

- **Description**: Add confirmation requirements, logging, and safeguards for resources with `source_delete_options` to prevent accidental data loss.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Accidental data deletion (High severity)
  - Malicious deletion through compromised credentials (High severity)

- **Impact**: Prevents accidental or unauthorized deletion of source data, which could lead to data loss.

- **Currently Implemented**: Basic configuration options exist across various feed types (S3, GCS, Azure) with validation for deletion options, but no additional safeguards are visible.

- **Missing Implementation**: Confirmations for destructive operations, detailed logging of deletion activities, and potential backup mechanisms or deletion grace periods.

## 9. Custom Endpoint Validation

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Implement validation for custom endpoint configurations.

- **Description**: Add strict validation for custom endpoint URLs to ensure they use secure protocols (HTTPS), validate certificates, and match expected patterns.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Redirection to malicious endpoints (High severity)
  - Man-in-the-middle attacks through invalid endpoints (High severity)

- **Impact**: Prevents accidental or malicious redirection of API traffic to untrusted endpoints.

- **Currently Implemented**: Basic validation exists (`validateCustomEndpoint`), but it only checks if the URL is valid without enforcing HTTPS or other security requirements.

- **Missing Implementation**: Enhanced validation to ensure HTTPS usage, certificate validation, and hostname verification for custom endpoints. The current validation function only checks if the URL can be parsed but doesn't enforce security requirements.

## 10. Secure Authentication Header Management

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Implement secure handling of authentication headers.

- **Description**: Ensure authentication headers are properly encrypted in transit, not logged, and properly formatted to prevent injection attacks.

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Injection attacks through header manipulation (Medium severity)
  - Credential exposure in logs (Medium severity)

- **Impact**: Reduces the risk of credential exposure and injection attacks through authentication headers.

- **Currently Implemented**: Basic header configuration exists for services like Thinkst Canary (`ThinkstCanaryAuthenticationHeaderKeyValues`) and Okta, with sensitive fields marked accordingly in the schema, but specific security measures for header handling aren't visible.

- **Missing Implementation**: Header value sanitization, prevention of logging header values, and secure header formatting guidelines. Integration with secret management services for dynamic header generation.
