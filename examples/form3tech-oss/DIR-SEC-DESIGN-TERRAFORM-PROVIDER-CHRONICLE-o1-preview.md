## BUSINESS POSTURE

The Terraform Chronicle provider enables organizations to manage Google Chronicle resources using Terraform, adopting infrastructure-as-code practices for security operations. The primary business goals are:

- **Simplify Management**: Streamline the provisioning and management of Chronicle configurations through automation.
- **Integration**: Integrate Chronicle resource management into existing Terraform workflows to ensure consistency.
- **Scalability and Efficiency**: Enhance efficiency in managing security infrastructure at scale.

Important business risks include:

- **Misconfiguration Risks**: Incorrect configurations could lead to security vulnerabilities or service disruptions.
- **Dependency on External APIs**: Changes in Chronicle APIs might affect the provider's functionality, impacting operations.
- **Adoption Challenges**: Users may require training to effectively use the provider, affecting productivity.

## SECURITY POSTURE

### Existing Security Controls

- **Security Control**: **Secure Coding Practices**
  - Implemented through adherence to Go best practices and code reviews.
- **Security Control**: **Authentication via OAuth 2.0**
  - Managed through secure handling of credentials and tokens in the provider configuration.
- **Security Control**: **Input Validation**
  - Implemented in provider code to ensure only valid configurations are processed.
- **Security Control**: **Error Handling and Logging**
  - Implemented in client code to handle API errors gracefully and log relevant information.
- **Security Control**: **Rate Limiting and Retry Logic**
  - Implemented in the HTTP client to manage API request rates and retries.
- **Security Control**: **Use of Well-Maintained Libraries**
  - Utilization of standard libraries and dependencies with security considerations.

### Accepted Risks

- **Accepted Risk**: **External API Dependence**
  - Reliance on Chronicle APIs could introduce risks if APIs change or become unavailable.
- **Accepted Risk**: **Credential Management by Users**
  - Users are responsible for securely managing their OAuth credentials and access tokens.

### Recommended Security Controls

- **Security Control**: **Secrets Management Integration**
  - Encourage integration with secrets management solutions for handling credentials securely.
- **Security Control**: **Automated Security Scanning**
  - Integrate tools like Static Application Security Testing (SAST) into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Security Control**: **Dependency Monitoring**
  - Implement dependency checking to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

### Security Requirements

1. **Authentication**
   - Securely manage OAuth 2.0 credentials to authenticate with Chronicle APIs.
   - Use environment variables or secrets managers to store sensitive information.
2. **Authorization**
   - Ensure the provider operates with least privilege, accessing only required resources.
3. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs and configurations to prevent invalid data processing.
   - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks or malformed requests.
4. **Cryptography**
   - Ensure all communications with Chronicle APIs are over TLS/SSL encrypted connections.
   - Use standard cryptographic libraries and adhere to best practices.

### BUILD

The build and publication process involves both local development and CI/CD pipelines to ensure code quality and security.

- **Local Development**:
  - Developers use `make build` to compile the provider.
  - Run `make test` for unit testing.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - Triggered by code commits using tools like GitHub Actions.
  - Steps include linting, testing, building, and generating documentation.
  - Uses `go mod` for dependency management.
  - Artifacts are published to GitHub Releases upon successful builds.
