# Threat Modeling Analysis for the Terraform Provider Chronicle Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

### Overview

The **terraform-provider-chronicle** is a Terraform provider that enables users to manage Google Chronicle resources using Terraform configurations. Google Chronicle is a cloud-based security analytics platform that allows organizations to collect, store, and analyze security data at scale. This provider facilitates infrastructure-as-code practices for Chronicle resources, promoting best practices in DevSecOps.

### Key Components and Features

- **Resource Management**: The provider supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting various Chronicle resources, including:

  - **Feeds**: Configurations for data ingestion from sources like Amazon S3, Amazon SQS, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, and others. Each feed type has specific configurations and authentication mechanisms.

  - **RBAC Subjects**: Role-based access control configurations for managing subject permissions.

  - **Reference Lists**: Lists used in rules and detections.

  - **Rules**: Detection rules written in YARA-L 2.0 format.

- **Authentication Handling**: The provider manages sensitive authentication credentials required for accessing feed sources and APIs.

- **Integration with Terraform**: Leverages Terraform's infrastructure-as-code capabilities to manage Chronicle resources, promoting automation and consistency.

### Dependencies

- **Programming Language**: Written in Go (requires version 1.21+).
- **Terraform Plugin SDK**: Uses the Terraform Plugin SDK v2 for provider development.
- **Google Cloud APIs**: Interacts with Chronicle APIs via HTTP requests, utilizing Google's API client libraries.
- **Third-party Packages**: Depends on packages for OAuth2 authentication, error handling, retry logic, and other utilities.

## 2. Define the Root Goal of the Attack Tree

**Attacker's Ultimate Objective**:

Compromise systems using the **terraform-provider-chronicle** by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses within the provider itself, leading to unauthorized access, execution of malicious operations, exposure of sensitive data, or disruption of services in users' Chronicle environments.

## 3. Identify High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)

1. **Exploit vulnerabilities in the provider code**.
2. **Insert malicious code into the codebase**.
3. **Compromise distribution channels**.
4. **Exploit user misconfigurations or insecure implementations**.
5. **Exploit dependencies to introduce malicious code**.
6. **Use social engineering to compromise maintainers or users**.
7. **Exploit insecure handling of credentials in configurations and examples**.

## 4. Expand Each Attack Path with Detailed Steps

- **7. Exploit Insecure Handling of Credentials in Configurations**

  - **Likelihood**: High
  - **Impact**: High
  - **Justification**: Storing credentials insecurely is a common issue, and attackers actively search public repositories for exposed secrets. The potential for unauthorized access is high.

- **1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Provider Code**

  - **Likelihood**: Medium
  - **Impact**: High
  - **Justification**: While it requires technical skill to identify and exploit code vulnerabilities, the potential impact is significant if successful.

- **6. Use Social Engineering**

  - **Likelihood**: Medium
  - **Impact**: High
  - **Justification**: Social engineering attacks are common and can lead to severe consequences if maintainers or users are compromised.

### Critical Nodes

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

### Questions

- **Are there mechanisms in place to detect and warn users about insecure handling of credentials in configurations?**

- **Is input validation and sanitization uniformly implemented across all parts of the provider code?**

- **Are there any automated tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for security testing and dependency vulnerability scanning?**

- **What measures are taken to secure the examples and documentation to prevent users from adopting insecure practices?**

### Assumptions

- **Users may not be fully aware of secure credential management practices.**

- **The provider does not currently enforce strict checks on how credentials are provided or stored.**

- **Documentation and examples may not sufficiently emphasize the importance of secure configurations.**
