# Attack Tree for Terraform Chronicle Provider

**Attacker Goal:** Compromise Chronicle Application by Exploiting Terraform Provider

## Compromise Chronicle Application

- **1. Exploit Credential Exposure**
  - Description: Attacker gains access to sensitive credentials used by the Terraform provider to authenticate with Chronicle APIs or external services integrated via feeds.
  - Actionable Insights:
    - Store Terraform state files securely and restrict access.
    - Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in Terraform configurations. Use secrets management tools or Terraform Cloud/Enterprise for secret handling.
    - Educate users on the risks of exposing environment variables containing credentials.
  - Likelihood: Medium
  - Impact: High (Full access to Chronicle APIs and integrated services, potential data breach, unauthorized actions within Chronicle and connected systems)
  - Effort: Low (If state files or environment are not properly secured)
  - Skill Level: Low
  - Detection Difficulty: Medium (Depends on monitoring of Chronicle API access and state file security)
  - **1.1. Retrieve Credentials from Terraform State Files**
    - Description: Attacker accesses Terraform state files (e.g., `.tfstate` or state stored in backend) which may contain plaintext credentials if not properly managed.
    - Actionable Insights:
      - Use a remote backend for Terraform state storage with access controls.
      - Enable state file encryption at rest and in transit for the backend.
      - Regularly audit access to Terraform state files.
    - Likelihood: Medium (If state backend is not secured)
    - Impact: High (Exposure of credentials)
    - Effort: Low (If state files are accessible)
    - Skill Level: Low
    - Detection Difficulty: Low (If state file access is not logged and monitored)
  - **1.2. Obtain Credentials from Environment Variables**
    - Description: Attacker gains access to environment variables where credentials like `CHRONICLE_BACKSTORY_CREDENTIALS`, `CHRONICLE_BIGQUERY_CREDENTIALS`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AZURE_SHARED_KEY`, `AZURE_SAS_TOKEN`, `OFFICE365_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OKTA_API_TOKEN`, `PROOFPOINT_SECRET`, `QUALYS_SECRET`, `THINKST_CANARY_TOKEN` etc., might be stored.
    - Actionable Insights:
      - Avoid storing credentials in environment variables if possible.
      - If environment variables are necessary, secure the environment where the provider is running.
      - Use more secure methods for credential management, such as credential files or access tokens.
    - Likelihood: Medium (If environment is not properly secured or in CI/CD pipelines logs)
    - Impact: High (Exposure of credentials)
    - Effort: Low (If environment is accessible or logs are exposed)
    - Skill Level: Low
    - Detection Difficulty: Medium (Depends on environment and logging security)
  - **1.3. Intercept Credentials during Input**
    - Description: Attacker intercepts credentials as they are input into Terraform configuration or passed via command-line if not handled securely.
    - Actionable Insights:
      - Use secure input methods and avoid echoing credentials in logs or command history.
      - Encourage use of credential files or access tokens instead of direct input.
    - Likelihood: Low
    - Impact: Medium (Exposure of credentials)
    - Effort: Medium (Requires local access or monitoring input methods)
    - Skill Level: Medium
    - Detection Difficulty: High (Difficult to detect real-time interception)

- **2. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on Custom Endpoints**
  - Description: Attacker intercepts communication between the Terraform provider and Chronicle API custom endpoints (e.g., `*_custom_endpoint`) if TLS is not enforced or misconfigured.
  - Actionable Insights:
    - Ensure TLS is always enabled and enforced for all Chronicle API endpoints, especially custom ones.
    - Validate TLS certificates to prevent MitM attacks.
    - Avoid using custom endpoints if not absolutely necessary and prefer official Chronicle API endpoints.
    - Properly configure and secure the network infrastructure where custom endpoints are hosted.
  - Likelihood: Medium (If custom endpoints are used without proper TLS configuration)
  - Impact: High (Data interception, credential theft, potential API manipulation)
  - Effort: Medium (Requires network access and MitM attack capabilities)
  - Skill Level: Medium
  - Detection Difficulty: Medium (Requires network monitoring and TLS inspection)

- **3. Exploit Debug Port Exposure**
  - Description: Attacker gains unauthorized access to the debugging port (2345) exposed by the `debug.sh` script, potentially allowing control over the provider process.
  - Actionable Insights:
    - Never expose the debug port to untrusted networks or the internet.
    - Only use the debug script in isolated, secure development environments.
    - Ensure the debug port is only accessible from localhost or trusted IPs.
    - Remove or disable debug functionality in production builds.
  - Likelihood: Low (If debug script is used only in development and port is not exposed)
  - Impact: Critical (Full control over provider process, potential credential extraction, manipulation of provider operations)
  - Effort: Low (If debug port is inadvertently exposed)
  - Skill Level: Medium
  - Detection Difficulty: Low (If debug port exposure is not monitored by network security tools)

- **4. Supply Chain Vulnerability via Dependencies**
  - Description: Attacker compromises a dependency used by the Terraform provider, potentially injecting malicious code that could be executed during provider operations.
  - Actionable Insights:
    - Regularly audit and update dependencies to their latest secure versions.
    - Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    - Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies and their versions.
    - Use vendoring to manage dependencies and reduce reliance on external repositories during build time.
  - Likelihood: Low (If dependencies are actively managed and scanned)
  - Impact: High (Potential remote code execution within the provider, data exfiltration, manipulation of provider operations)
  - Effort: Medium (Requires identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in dependencies)
  - Skill Level: High
  - Detection Difficulty: Medium (Requires sophisticated monitoring and code analysis to detect malicious dependency behavior)

- **5. Vulnerability in Feed Resource Logic**
  - Description: Attacker exploits a vulnerability in the code that handles feed resources (e.g., `resource_feed_amazon_s3.go`, `resource_feed_okta_system_log.go`, `resource_feed_thinkst_canary.go`, etc.), potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security breaches when processing external data sources. This could include issues in input validation, data parsing, or handling of authentication details for external services.
  - Actionable Insights:
    - Implement robust input validation for all feed configurations and data sources.
    - Conduct thorough security testing, including fuzzing and static analysis, of feed resource logic.
    - Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection flaws and buffer overflows in feed processing code.
    - Isolate feed processing logic to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
    - Pay close attention to the handling of authentication credentials for external services within feed resources, ensuring secure storage and transmission.
  - Likelihood: Medium (Given the complexity of handling various feed types and data sources)
  - Impact: Medium (Denial of service, data corruption, potential information disclosure, unauthorized access to external services, depending on the vulnerability)
  - Effort: Medium (Requires identifying and exploiting specific vulnerabilities in feed resource logic)
  - Skill Level: Medium
  - Detection Difficulty: Medium (Requires code review and monitoring of provider behavior for anomalies)

- **6. Malicious Rule Injection**
  - Description: Attacker injects malicious YARA-L rules via the `chronicle_rule` resource. This could lead to false positives/negatives in security detections, resource exhaustion within Chronicle, or potentially exploitation of vulnerabilities in Chronicle's rule processing engine.
  - Actionable Insights:
    - Implement strict input validation and sanitization for `rule_text` attribute to prevent injection of malicious code or unexpected rule syntax that could cause errors or bypass security checks within Chronicle.
    - Perform static analysis and security scanning of YARA-L rules before applying them to Chronicle to detect potentially malicious patterns or logic.
    - Implement monitoring and alerting for rule deployments and modifications to detect unauthorized or suspicious changes.
    - Follow least privilege principles when granting permissions to manage Chronicle rules, limiting access to authorized personnel only.
  - Likelihood: Low (Requires ability to modify Terraform configuration and apply changes)
