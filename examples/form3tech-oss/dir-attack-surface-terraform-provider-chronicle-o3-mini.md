# Attack Surface Analysis for terraform-provider-chronicle

This Terraform provider integrates with Google Chronicle’s various APIs (e.g. backstory, ingestion, forwarder, feeds, rules, subjects, and reference lists) and exposes its configuration (via resource schemas and provider settings) to users. Because it acts as a client to remote API services (with support for custom endpoints) while reading sensitive credentials and exposing debug functionality when enabled, several digital entry points must be secured.

## Attack Surface Identification

- **Configuration Input & Credential Handling**
  • The provider exposes many configurable parameters (via the provider schema and resource blocks) such as API credentials, access tokens, custom endpoints, region settings, timeouts, and retry attempts.
  • Credentials for different Chronicle APIs (BigQuery, Backstory, Ingestion, Forwarder) may be provided either as a file path, file contents, or base64-encoded via environment variables (see provider schema in chronicle/provider.go and validation in validation.go).
  • The helper function (pathOrContents in client/util.go) reads either file content or raw string data. Faulty use or misinterpretation here could leak or misuse sensitive data.

- **API Endpoint Construction & Communication**
  • The provider generates target API endpoints for multiple services (Events, Alerts, Artifacts, Aliases, Assets, IOC, Rules, Feed Management, Subjects, Reference Lists) using default and custom base paths (see client/endpoints.go and endpoints in providerConfigure).
  • Custom endpoints can be specified via configuration. Although a validation function (validateCustomEndpoint in validation.go) calls url.ParseRequestURI, any loopholes in this input validation may allow attackers to redirect API calls (for example, causing SSRF).

- **HTTP Request Execution & Error Handling**
  • All API calls are made via HTTPS. However, the client (using http.Client as set up in client/initHTTPClient) and the transport wrapper (in client/transport.go) are responsible for sending sensitive command payloads (e.g. rule_text in detection resources, feed configurations) from the provider to Chronicle’s backend.
  • Error responses (handled in client/error.go) may include details from failed HTTP calls. If these error messages are verbose or not sanitized, they might reveal sensitive internal state.

- **Debug & Development Interfaces**
  • The provided debug.sh script (and the main.go “-debug” flag) launches the provider with support for debuggers like Delve and listens on port 2345. In a production setting this interface must be disabled or strictly access–controlled because it could otherwise give an attacker an interactive debugging session.

- **Resource and API Abstractions**
  • The provider defines multiple resource types (feeds for various backends, rules, RBAC subjects, reference lists) where the request/response transformation code (in various files under chronicle/) represents a digital boundary between Terraform state and the remote API.
  • Each resource has “expand” and “flatten” functions to map user-supplied Terraform configuration to API request objects. If these mappings are not robust, an attacker might inject unexpected values.

*Reference implementation details:*
– Provider configuration logic is in chronicle/provider.go
– Credential and environment variable handling is in client/util.go and validation.go
– API endpoint construction is defined in client/endpoints.go
– Debugging support is provided in debug.sh and main.go

## Threat Enumeration

Using a STRIDE–style categorization, the following threats have been identified:

- **Spoofing**
  • An adversary might supply falsified or manipulated credentials (or intercept environment–provided tokens) to impersonate a legitimate Chronicle client.
  • If custom endpoints are not strictly validated, an attacker could supply a spoofed endpoint and trick the provider into sending requests to a malicious server.
  • *Affected Components:* Credential reading in provider configuration; custom endpoint fields and their validations in validation.go.

- **Tampering**
  • An attacker intercepting HTTP requests (if TLS is misconfigured or certificates are not validated correctly) could modify the request payloads to change resource state or inject malicious configuration updates.
  • Malicious manipulation of API responses (for example, through a compromised custom endpoint) might lead to incorrect Terraform state.
  • *Affected Components:* HTTP communication implemented in client/transport.go and endpoint construction.

- **Repudiation**
  • Without proper audit logging of all API transactions, an attacker might later deny responsibility for unauthorized changes made through the provider.
  • *Affected Components:* The provider’s logging and error–handling (in client/error.go and within resource CRUD functions).

- **Information Disclosure**
  • Sensitive data (such as API credentials, access tokens, client secrets, and rule texts that might contain sensitive logic) can inadvertently be logged, especially in debug mode or if error responses are overly verbose.
  • Misconfigured debug environments (e.g. an exposed port 2345) may allow an attacker to inspect process memory or call sensitive functions.
  • *Affected Components:* Debug support in debug.sh and main.go; logging and error–reporting in client/error.go and validation functions.

- **Denial of Service (DoS)**
  • An attacker might repeatedly submit requests (or force the provider to poll endpoints) in an attempt to exhaust available rate–limits or overwhelm the Chronicle backend.
  • If the rate–limiting defaults (in client/endpoints.go, using golang.org/x/time/rate) are too generous or misconfigured, a DoS attack is possible.
  • *Affected Components:* API request functions in client/transport.go and rate limiter settings maintained in client/endpoints.go.

- **Elevation of Privilege**
  • By manipulating custom endpoint values or resource configuration, an attacker might redirect API calls to internal administrative services or cause the provider to run unvalidated code.
  • Even though the provider itself runs with the privileges granted via the backend credentials, a misdirected API call could be used to escalate privileges within the Chronicle environment.
  • *Affected Components:* Custom endpoint configuration in provider/provider.go and client/endpoints.go.

## Impact Assessment

- **Information Disclosure**
  • *Confidentiality Impact:* Leakage of credentials or secret tokens could allow an attacker to impersonate users or access sensitive Chronicle functions.
  • *Likelihood:* Medium if debug mode is inadvertently enabled or logs are not scrubbed.
  • *Severity:* High.

- **Tampering**
  • *Integrity Impact:* Modification of API requests or responses could alter Terraform state, leading to misconfiguration of cloud resources.
  • *Likelihood:* Medium (especially if custom endpoints are abused).
  • *Severity:* High.

- **Denial of Service**
  • *Availability Impact:* Overwhelming API endpoints via repeated calls might cause resource throttling or downtime.
  • *Likelihood:* Medium, depending on network security measures and rate limiter settings.
  • *Severity:* Moderate to high as it may block infrastructure changes.

- **Spoofing & Elevation of Privilege**
  • *Integrity & Confidentiality Impact:* Successful spoofing or endpoint redirection can let attackers bypass authentication, impersonate trusted clients, or send administrative commands.
  • *Likelihood:* Medium (if input validations are insufficient).
  • *Severity:* High.

- **Repudiation**
  • *Accountability Impact:* Without robust audit logging, malicious actions might go untraced, though this risk is lower than credential compromise.
  • *Likelihood:* Medium to low.
  • *Severity:* Low to moderate.

## Threat Ranking

1. **Information Disclosure (Critical):**
   The most significant risk is the potential leakage of sensitive credentials (API keys, tokens, secrets) which could compromise backend systems.

2. **Elevation of Privilege (High):**
   Manipulation of custom endpoints or resource configuration could let an attacker escalate privileges or redirect execution to malicious endpoints.

3. **Tampering (High):**
   Modification of HTTP payloads or responses could lead to unintended changes in Terraform state and backend configuration.

4. **Denial of Service (Medium):**
   While rate limiting and retries exist, attackers could exploit misconfigurations to exhaust resources.

5. **Spoofing (Medium):**
   Although TLS and strict credential requirements reduce risk, spoofing remains a threat if credentials are mishandled.

6. **Repudiation (Lower):**
   Lack of logging/audit trails has a lower immediate impact compared to other threats but must be addressed.

## Mitigation Recommendations

- **Secure Credential Handling:**
  • Enforce strict validation (as implemented in validation.go) and prefer using environment variables with proper permissions.
  • Avoid logging any credentials or secret tokens; when running in debug mode, scrub or completely disable logging of sensitive data.

- **Custom Endpoint Hardening:**
  • Restrict custom endpoints to a whitelist of allowed hosts or domain patterns.
  • Enhance the validateCustomEndpoint function (in validation.go) to check that endpoints belong to known Chronicle API domains.

- **Secure Debug Mode:**
  • Ensure debug mode (and the debug.sh script) is used only in controlled, development environments.
  • In production, compile and deploy the provider without the debug flag and close port 2345 via firewall rules.

- **Enforce TLS and Certificate Validation:**
  • Confirm that HTTP clients (in client/initHTTPClient) use proper TLS settings and verify server certificates to thwart MITM attacks.

- **Rate Limiting and Request Sanitization:**
  • Review and potentially tighten the rate limits in client/endpoints.go.
  • Log and monitor abnormal API usage patterns to detect possible DoS attempts.

- **Comprehensive Error Handling and Auditing:**
  • Sanitize error messages (in client/error.go) before logging or returning them.
  • Implement robust audit logging to record all sensitive operations for later forensic analysis.

- **Code and Dependency Management:**
  • Regularly update third–party dependencies (as defined in go.mod) to minimize vulnerabilities from external libraries.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

1. **Custom Endpoint Constraints:**
   – Q: Should custom endpoints be limited strictly to preapproved Chronicle domains, rather than accepting any URL?
   – A: It is assumed that they should be restricted to a known set of domains given the sensitive operations performed.

2. **Debug Mode Availability:**
   – Q: Is the debug mode provided only for development environments?
   – A: Assumed yes. In production, debug mode must be disabled and any debug ports should not be exposed externally.

3. **Credential Source Priority:**
   – Q: Does the order of precedence for credentials (file path through TF > access token through TF > environment variable) provide sufficient protection?
   – A: It is assumed that this order is acceptable but mandates that all input sources be carefully validated and protected.

4. **Rate Limiter Adequacy:**
   – Q: Are the current rate–limiting values (1 request per second) sufficient to prevent abuse without hindering normal operation?
   – A: Assumed that these defaults are reasonable—but should be reviewed in light of production API usage.

5. **Logging Practices:**
   – Q: Are existing logging mechanisms sufficiently protected (e.g. are logs stored securely and scrubbed of sensitive information)?
   – A: It is assumed that logging should follow best practices; however, explicit measures should be reviewed.

6. **Deployment Environment:**
   – Q: Does the provider run in a tightly controlled environment where network access is already restricted, or is it potentially exposed?
   – A: The assumption is that it is deployed in a trusted environment, but the digital attack surface remains significant if network segmentation or access controls are misconfigured.
