# APPLICATION THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS

1. **Source Code of 'f1' Framework**
   - Description: The codebase of the `f1` load testing framework, written in Go. This includes scripts, configurations, and source files that make up the framework.
2. **Test Scenarios Developed by Users**
   - Description: Load testing scripts developed using the `f1` framework, which may include code that interacts with external APIs and message queues.
3. **Configurations and Secrets**
   - Description: Configuration files and environment variables used to run tests. These may contain sensitive information such as API keys, credentials, and endpoints.
4. **Log Files and Metrics**
   - Description: Output data generated during tests, including logs and performance metrics, which may contain sensitive information about the systems under test and the test configurations.
5. **Dependencies and Third-Party Libraries**
   - Description: External libraries and tools used by `f1`, such as Prometheus metrics and other Go packages, which may introduce vulnerabilities.
6. **Logging Data**
   - Description: Logs generated by the `f1` framework, possibly containing sensitive information, error messages, stack traces, and execution details.
7. **Metrics Data**
   - Description: Performance metrics and timing data collected during test execution, which may be sent to external monitoring systems.
8. **Test Execution Context**
   - Description: The in-memory data and state during test execution, including execution contexts, function pointers, and runtime information.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES

1. **Boundary between `f1` Framework and User-Provided Test Scenarios**
   - The `f1` framework executes user-defined test scenarios. Malicious code in test scenarios could affect the framework's operation.
2. **Boundary between `f1` and External Services under Test**
   - `f1` communicates with external APIs and message queues. Data from these services should not be trusted without validation.
3. **Boundary between Development Environment and Build System**
   - Code is developed locally and then built using build tools, potentially in CI environments. The integrity of the build process must be maintained.
4. **Boundary between Build System and Deployment Environment**
   - Build artifacts are deployed and executed in different environments. Unauthorized modifications could compromise the deployment.
5. **Boundary between `f1` and Logging/Monitoring Systems**
   - `f1` sends logs and metrics to external systems. Data sent to these systems must be secured.
6. **Boundary between `f1` Framework and Dependencies/Third-Party Libraries**
   - `f1` depends on external libraries and packages. Vulnerabilities or malicious code in these dependencies could compromise `f1`.

## DATA FLOWS

1. **Execution of Test Scenarios**
   - Data Flow: Test scenarios are read and executed by `f1`.
   - Trust Boundary: Crosses the boundary between user-provided code and the `f1` framework.
2. **Communication with External Services**
   - Data Flow: `f1` sends HTTP requests to external APIs and receives responses.
   - Trust Boundary: Crosses the boundary between `f1` and external services.
3. **Message Queue Interaction**
   - Data Flow: `f1` consumes messages from message queues and processes them.
   - Trust Boundary: Crosses the boundary between `f1` and message queues.
4. **Logging and Metrics Collection**
   - Data Flow: `f1` generates logs and sends metrics to logging and monitoring systems.
   - Trust Boundary: Crosses the boundary between `f1` and monitoring services.
5. **Configuration and Secrets Loading**
   - Data Flow: `f1` reads configuration files and environment variables.
   - Trust Boundary: Crosses the boundary between the filesystem/environment and the `f1` process.
6. **Dependency Management and Updates**
   - Data Flow: `f1` retrieves and integrates third-party dependencies during build and run time.
   - Trust Boundary: Crosses between `f1` and external repositories hosting dependencies.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- **Questions:**
  1. Are there any mechanisms in place to sanitize logs and prevent sensitive data from being recorded by the `f1` framework?
  2. How is concurrency safety ensured in the `f1` codebase? Are there code review practices focusing on concurrency issues?
  3. What measures are taken to verify the integrity of third-party tools like `golangci-lint` during installation?
  4. Are build environments isolated per build, or are resources shared among builds?
  5. Are there procedures to regularly update build scripts, deployment scripts, and dependencies to address security vulnerabilities?
  6. How are command-line inputs validated in the `f1` CLI to prevent injection attacks?

- **Assumptions:**
  1. The `f1` framework does not currently implement log sanitization, and logs may contain sensitive information.
  2. Concurrency issues may not have been a focus during code development, potentially introducing race conditions or deadlocks.
  3. The installation of build tools and dependencies does not include integrity verification steps.
  4. Build environments may reuse resources without full isolation between builds.
  5. Regular updates and security reviews of build and deployment scripts may not be in place.
  6. Input validation for command-line arguments may not be fully implemented.

---

The goal of this updated threat model is to incorporate new findings from the project's codebase into the existing model, highlighting realistic threats based on the `f1` framework's design and implementation. By identifying and prioritizing these threats, appropriate mitigations can be implemented to enhance the security posture of the application and its deployment pipeline. The focus remains on defending against threats that pose significant real-world risks, based on both the likelihood of occurrence and potential impact.
