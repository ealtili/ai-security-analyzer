- Mitigation strategy: Securely configure RBAC Subjects with least privilege roles
  - Description:
    - Step 1: In the provider documentation for the `chronicle_rbac_subject` resource, add a dedicated security considerations section.
    - Step 2: Clearly document the principle of least privilege as it applies to RBAC subject roles. Emphasize the importance of assigning only the necessary roles required for the subject's intended function.
    - Step 3: Provide concrete examples of role assignments for different use cases (e.g., a subject for viewing alerts should only have the 'Viewer' role, not 'Editor' or 'Administrator').
    - Step 4: Warn against assigning overly permissive roles like 'Administrator' unless absolutely necessary, highlighting the potential risks of unauthorized actions and data access.
  - List of threats mitigated:
    - Threat: RBAC Subject Misconfiguration
      - Severity: Medium. Assigning excessive roles to subjects can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive Chronicle data and functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications.
  - Impact:
    - Reduces the risk of unauthorized access and actions within Chronicle by guiding users to configure RBAC subjects with appropriate and minimal roles.
  - Currently implemented:
    - Not implemented. Documentation for `chronicle_rbac_subject` resource currently focuses on usage and parameters, but lacks security best practices guidance on role assignments.
  - Missing implementation:
    - Add security considerations and best practices for RBAC subject role configurations to the documentation of the `chronicle_rbac_subject` resource.
