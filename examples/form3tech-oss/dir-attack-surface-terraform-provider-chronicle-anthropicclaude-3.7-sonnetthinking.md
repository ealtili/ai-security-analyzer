# ATTACK SURFACE ANALYSIS FOR TERRAFORM-PROVIDER-CHRONICLE

## 1. Hardcoded Credentials and Secrets

**Description:**
The code contains test files with hardcoded placeholder credentials and authentication tokens.

**How terraform-provider-chronicle contributes to the attack surface:**
While most credentials appear to be placeholders (like `XXXXX` or random strings generated during tests), some test files contain patterns that might accidentally include real credentials in development environments. This could potentially lead to credential leakage if developers accidentally commit real credentials.

**Example:**
In `resource_feed_thinkst_canary_test.go`, there are functions like:
```go
key := "auth_token"
value := randString(10)
```

**Impact:**
If real credentials were accidentally committed, they could be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to Chronicle resources or APIs.

**Risk Severity:**
Medium

**Current Mitigations:**
Most credentials appear to be placeholders or randomly generated values, reducing risk of real credential exposure. Random string generation is used for tests instead of hardcoded values.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Implement secret scanning in CI/CD pipelines
- Add clear warnings in code comments about not using real credentials in tests
- Use environment variables or secure vaults for all credentials, even in test code

## 2. API Authentication Token Handling

**Description:**
The provider uses various authentication methods including credentials files and access tokens, with potential security implications in how they are handled.

**How terraform-provider-chronicle contributes to the attack surface:**
The application handles sensitive authentication data including API tokens, access keys, and credentials for multiple services (Chronicle, Google Cloud, AWS, Azure). Improper handling of these tokens could lead to security vulnerabilities.

**Example:**
In `client.go`, tokens are processed from various sources:
```go
func (cli *Client) GetCredentials(...) {
    if accessToken != "" {
        // Handling of access token...
        token := &oauth2.Token{AccessToken: contents}
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
Potential leak of authentication tokens could allow attackers to access Chronicle resources or underlying cloud resources.

**Risk Severity:**
High

**Current Mitigations:**
The code implements proper token source abstraction through OAuth2 libraries. Credentials can be provided through environment variables rather than in code.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Implement token rotation capabilities
- Add clear token lifecycle management
- Improve logging practices to avoid accidentally logging sensitive token information

## 3. Insufficient Input Validation

**Description:**
While the code contains some input validation, certain inputs aren't comprehensively validated before being used to make API calls.

**How terraform-provider-chronicle contributes to the attack surface:**
The provider accepts user input for various configuration parameters which are then used to construct API calls. Insufficient validation could potentially lead to injection attacks.

**Example:**
Some validation functions like `validateReferenceListContentType` check for specific values, but there might be other inputs that lack comprehensive validation:
```go
func validateReferenceListContentType(v interface{}, k cty.Path) diag.Diagnostics {
    contentTypes := []string{string(chronicle.ReferenceListContentTypeCIDR),
        string(chronicle.ReferenceListContentTypeREGEX),
        string(chronicle.ReferenceListContentTypeDefault)}
    // ...
}
```

**Impact:**
Malicious input could potentially lead to API injection attacks or unexpected behavior in the Chronicle service.

**Risk Severity:**
Medium

**Current Mitigations:**
The code includes validation functions for many parameters, including content types, hostnames, and other critical inputs.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Implement more comprehensive input validation for all user-provided parameters
- Use parameterized inputs for API calls where possible
- Add sanitization for inputs used in URL construction

## 4. Error Handling Exposing Sensitive Information

**Description:**
Error messages might include sensitive information that could be exposed to users or logs.

**How terraform-provider-chronicle contributes to the attack surface:**
The application handles errors from API calls and other operations, and in some cases may include detailed error information that could reveal implementation details or sensitive data.

**Example:**
In `error.go`, the error message includes potentially sensitive details:
```go
func (c *ChronicleAPIError) Error() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s: %s, HTTP status code: %d", c.Result, c.Message, c.HTTPStatusCode)
}
```

**Impact:**
Verbose error messages could leak implementation details or other sensitive information, aiding attackers in understanding the system.

**Risk Severity:**
Medium

**Current Mitigations:**
Some error handling is implemented to normalize error responses from the API.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Implement a consistent approach to error handling that filters sensitive information
- Add logging levels to control verbosity of error information
- Sanitize error messages before returning them to users

## 5. Insecure HTTP Connections

**Description:**
The code potentially allows unencrypted HTTP connections for API communications.

**How terraform-provider-chronicle contributes to the attack surface:**
While most URLs in the code use HTTPS, there's no explicit enforcement to prevent HTTP URLs from being used, potentially allowing unencrypted communications.

**Example:**
In `endpoints.go`, the URL construction doesn't explicitly force HTTPS:
```go
func getBasePathFromDomainsAndPath(basePath string, domain string) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("https://%s.%s%s", domain, APIDomain, basePath)
}
```

**Impact:**
Data transmitted over unencrypted connections could be intercepted by attackers through man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Risk Severity:**
Medium

**Current Mitigations:**
Default URLs are constructed with HTTPS, reducing the likelihood of unencrypted communications.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Enforce HTTPS for all connections
- Add TLS configuration options for controlling certificate validation
- Implement certificate pinning for critical API endpoints

## 6. Rate Limiting and Request Retry Vulnerabilities

**Description:**
The provider implements rate limiting and request retries, but improper implementation could lead to denial of service or request duplication issues.

**How terraform-provider-chronicle contributes to the attack surface:**
The application uses retry logic for API requests, with potential for causing unintended effects if retries are performed for non-idempotent operations.

**Example:**
In `transport.go`, there's a retry mechanism:
```go
err := retry.Do(
    func() error {
        // API request code...
    },
    retry.Attempts(client.requestAttempts),
    retry.DelayType(retry.BackOffDelay),
    // ...
)
```

**Impact:**
Improper retry logic could cause duplicate operations, resource exhaustion, or denial of service conditions.

**Risk Severity:**
Medium

**Current Mitigations:**
Rate limiters are implemented for different API operations, and retries use exponential backoff.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Ensure all retried operations are idempotent
- Add circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
- Implement more granular control over which operations can be retried
