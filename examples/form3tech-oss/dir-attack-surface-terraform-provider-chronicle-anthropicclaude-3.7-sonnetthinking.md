# Attack Surface Analysis for Chronicle Terraform Provider

This analysis focuses on the security implications of using the Chronicle Terraform Provider to manage Chronicle resources. This provider manages interactions with Google Chronicle's security analytics platform, allowing for infrastructure-as-code management of Chronicle resources.

## Key Attack Surfaces

### 1. Credential Management in Terraform State
- **Description**: The provider handles various types of credentials that are stored in Terraform state.
- **How terraform-provider-chronicle contributes**: Stores sensitive credentials like AWS access keys, API tokens, and OAuth client secrets in state files.
- **Example**: Secret keys for S3 feeds (`secret_access_key`), Office 365 credentials (`client_secret`), Okta API tokens, Thinkst Canary authentication tokens, and Qualys VM credentials.
- **Impact**: If the Terraform state is compromised, attackers could gain access to multiple external services and data sources integrated with Chronicle.
- **Risk severity**: High
- **Current mitigations**: Sensitive fields are properly marked in the schema to prevent logging, but they remain stored in state files.
- **Missing mitigations**: Consider supporting integration with external secret management services instead of storing secrets directly in state.

### 2. External Service Authentication
- **Description**: The provider authenticates to various external services to ingest data.
- **How terraform-provider-chronicle contributes**: Manages authentication to services like AWS, Azure, GCP, Okta, Microsoft, Qualys, and Thinkst Canary.
- **Example**: When configuring feeds from Amazon S3, Microsoft Office 365, Thinkst Canary, or Qualys VM, the provider handles the authentication mechanisms to these services.
- **Impact**: Improperly secured authentication credentials could lead to unauthorized access to external services beyond Chronicle itself.
- **Risk severity**: High
- **Current mitigations**: Authentication parameters are configured through structured schemas with sensitivity markings, and multiple authentication methods are supported.
- **Missing mitigations**: Enable support for using instance roles/managed identities instead of explicit credentials when possible.

### 3. Custom API Endpoints
- **Description**: The provider allows configuration of custom API endpoints for Chronicle.
- **How terraform-provider-chronicle contributes**: Users can specify custom endpoints for various Chronicle APIs, potentially redirecting API calls.
- **Example**: `rule_custom_endpoint`, `feed_custom_endpoint`, and other endpoint configurations.
- **Impact**: Improperly validated endpoints could lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or data exfiltration.
- **Risk severity**: Medium
- **Current mitigations**: The code shows evidence of validation for custom endpoints.
- **Missing mitigations**: Ensure validation includes proper URL sanitization and restriction to known-safe domains.

### 4. Source URI Handling
- **Description**: The provider configures URIs for data ingestion from various storage platforms.
- **How terraform-provider-chronicle contributes**: Manages URIs that specify where to ingest security data from.
- **Example**: S3 bucket URIs (`s3://s3-bucket/`), Azure Blob Storage container URIs, GCS bucket URIs.
- **Impact**: Improperly validated URIs could lead to path traversal or resource exhaustion attacks.
- **Risk severity**: Medium
- **Current mitigations**: Different validation functions exist for various URI types.
- **Missing mitigations**: Implement comprehensive URI validation to prevent unauthorized access to resources or malicious URI patterns.

### 5. Feed Configuration Security
- **Description**: The provider manages complex feed configurations for data ingestion.
- **How terraform-provider-chronicle contributes**: Configures various feed parameters including deletion options that could affect source data.
- **Example**: Source deletion options like `SOURCE_DELETION_ON_SUCCESS` which delete files after ingestion.
- **Impact**: Misconfiguration could lead to data loss in source systems or excessive permissions.
- **Risk severity**: Medium
- **Current mitigations**: Schema validation helps prevent some misconfigurations.
- **Missing mitigations**: Add explicit warnings before enabling destructive options like source deletion, and implement proper permission verification.

### 6. RBAC Subject Management
- **Description**: The provider manages role-based access control (RBAC) subjects and their permissions.
- **How terraform-provider-chronicle contributes**: Creates and assigns roles to subjects (users or groups) with various permission levels.
- **Example**: Creating analyst subjects with Editor or Viewer roles through the `chronicle_rbac_subject` resource.
- **Impact**: Misconfiguration could lead to privilege escalation or excessive permissions being granted.
- **Risk severity**: Medium
- **Current mitigations**: The provider uses a structured schema for role assignments and validates subject types.
- **Missing mitigations**: Implement principle of least privilege defaults and include role validation against established permission sets.

### 7. Regular Expression Handling in Reference Lists
- **Description**: The provider supports reference lists with regular expression content types.
- **How terraform-provider-chronicle contributes**: Allows users to create and manage reference lists containing regular expressions.
- **Example**: Reference lists with content_type "REGEX" that might contain complex patterns.
- **Impact**: Malformed regular expressions could lead to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks.
- **Risk severity**: Medium
- **Current mitigations**: Basic content type validation exists to ensure proper designation of regex content.
- **Missing mitigations**: Implement regex complexity validation and potential runtime limits on regex evaluation.

This analysis identifies the primary attack surfaces introduced specifically by the Chronicle Terraform Provider. Organizations using this provider should particularly focus on securing Terraform state files and carefully managing the credentials used for external service authentication.
