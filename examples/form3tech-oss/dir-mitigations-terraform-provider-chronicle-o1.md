## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict or Validate Custom Endpoints
   - **Description:**
     1. Disallow or strictly validate the custom endpoint fields (e.g., "alert_custom_endpoint", "rule_custom_endpoint", etc.) so that they can only point to trusted domains.
     2. Implement a domain allowlist verifying the endpoint is “*.googleapis.com” (or other trusted Chronicle domain) before sending requests or credentials.
     3. Reject or warn if the user attempts to set a custom endpoint outside this allowlist.

   - **List of Threats Mitigated:**
     - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): High severity, because an attacker can force the provider to send requests (with credentials) to a malicious domain.

   - **Impact:**
     - Reduces the likelihood that sensitive credentials or requests will be redirected to malicious external servers. Effectively mitigates SSRF risk for these endpoints.

   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - The provider validates endpoints only by checking if they are well-formed URIs (“validateCustomEndpoint”), but not whether they belong to a trusted domain.

   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - No domain restriction is in place. A user can still specify a valid but malicious domain. Require code changes in “provider.go” to check custom endpoints against an allowlist.


2. **Mitigation Strategy:** Sensitive Fields Marked, But Enforce Secure State Handling
   - **Description:**
     1. Confirm that all secrets (AWS Secret Keys, Okta tokens, Azure shared keys, Chronicle credentials, etc.) are declared “Sensitive: true” in Terraform schema (so they do not appear in logs/plans).
     2. Educate users that Terraform state files are stored in plaintext by default, and they must save state remotely (e.g., Terraform Cloud/Enterprise, or an encrypted backend like S3 with KMS).
     3. Provide a recommended configuration snippet in documentation (e.g., examples of remote state with encryption).

   - **List of Threats Mitigated:**
     - Accidental Secret Disclosure: Medium severity, as unencrypted state or logs can leak valid credentials.

   - **Impact:**
     - Marking fields “Sensitive” prevents them from being logged. Combined with encouraging secure backends, it significantly reduces accidental leaks of credentials.

   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - The code does mark secrets as “Sensitive: true” (e.g., “secret_access_key” or “client_secret”).

   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - No enforcement or documentation on using secure backends. Users can still store plaintext secrets in local state. Provide clear usage docs or checks to ensure secure backends.


3. **Mitigation Strategy:** Warn on Potentially Insecure Credential Input (Local File / Inline)
   - **Description:**
     1. Whenever users use inline secrets or local file paths for credentials, print a console warning that those secrets may reside in the .tf file or local disk.
     2. Document ephemeral authentication best practices (e.g., short-lived tokens, environment variables) so credentials do not get committed in version control.
     3. Log an informational message if the user sets the “credentials” field, advising them to rotate credentials and store them only in ephemeral storage.

   - **List of Threats Mitigated:**
     - Long-lived Credential Leaks: Medium severity, as secrets accidentally get committed to source code.

   - **Impact:**
     - Encourages best practices for ephemeral or short-lived access. Yarn uncommitted secrets are less likely to remain in code repos.

   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - The code can parse credentials from local paths or environment variables but does not produce warnings or best-practice guidelines.

   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - No inline guidance or console messaging. Implement or update “providerConfigure” or “provider.go” logic to log warnings for these credential-intake fields.


4. **Mitigation Strategy:** Domain-Specific Input Validation for Resource Fields
   - **Description:**
     1. In resources like “chronicle_feed_amazon_s3” or “chronicle_feed_okta_system_log,” add stricter validations to domain/hostname fields if applicable.
     2. Example: For Okta resources, confirm the hostname ends with “.okta.com” or “.oktapreview.com” unless overridden.
     3. For Azure URIs, verify the “blob.core.windows.net” subdomain.

   - **List of Threats Mitigated:**
     - Malicious Endpoint Injection: Medium severity, as an attacker or misconfiguration could redirect the feed to a hostile domain.

   - **Impact:**
     - Greatly limits the scope of accidental or malicious redirection by restricting resource hostnames to known providers.

   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - Minimal or partial custom validation exists for some fields (like “validateThinkstCanaryHostname” or “validateGCSURI”), but not consistently.

   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - Many resource hostnames are only loosely validated (just a regex, or none). Expand existing “validation.go” to implement domain checks for each feed resource.


5. **Mitigation Strategy:** Consistent Role-Based Enforcement in RBAC Subject Resource
   - **Description:**
     1. Provide an allowlist for valid Chronicle roles (e.g., “Viewer,” “Editor,” “Administrator,” etc.) so users cannot create or assign unknown roles.
     2. Validate the “roles” field input in “resourceRBACSubjectCreate” and “resourceRBACSubjectUpdate.”
     3. If an invalid role is provided, show an error or warning before sending the request.

   - **List of Threats Mitigated:**
     - Privilege Escalation / Role Misconfiguration: Potentially high severity, if arbitrary roles can be assigned and the backend does not strictly enforce or checks for known roles.

   - **Impact:**
     - Simplifies user experience and ensures only recognized roles are assigned, reducing misconfigurations or hidden escalations.

   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - The code does not implement a known role list. The server may reject invalid roles, but the user sees a server-side error.

   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - A local role validation or enumerated role check is not present in “resource_rbac_subject.go.” Implement a local check to ensure only valid roles pass through.


6. **Mitigation Strategy:** Document and Enforce Resource Size or Field Length Limits for YARA Rule Text
   - **Description:**
     1. Add validation for “rule_text” length or complexity (e.g., limit to a certain MB or lines).
     2. If the user attempts to upload an excessively large rule, reject early to avoid resource hogging or potential DoS.
     3. Provide documentation on recommended maximum rule text size or parse complexity.

   - **List of Threats Mitigated:**
     - Potential Denial of Service (DoS): Low to medium severity, since the server might handle huge rules but can be slowed or disrupted.

   - **Impact:**
     - Minimizes the chance of an unbounded input causing excess usage or partial service disruption.

   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - Code verifies the rule ends with a newline but no size or complexity checks.

   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - Impose rule-text length checks in “validateRuleText” or prior to sending to “client.VerifyYARARule.”

These strategies address key issues uniquely introduced by this project (custom endpoints, storing sensitive feeds, misconfiguration pitfalls). By combining endpoint restrictions, improved validations, secure Terraform-state usage, and proper warnings, the team can significantly reduce threats without relying on only general or external security controls.
