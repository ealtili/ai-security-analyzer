# APPLICATION THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS

- API Credentials: Access tokens, client secrets, and OAuth credentials used to authenticate with Chronicle APIs.
- User Configuration Data: Terraform configuration files containing provider settings and resource definitions, which may include sensitive information.
- Provider Source Code: The codebase of the Terraform provider, which should be protected from unauthorized modifications.
- Terraform State Files: State files that store resource mappings and may contain sensitive data about the infrastructure.
- Feed Authentication Credentials: Credentials and authentication details used to configure feeds to external data sources (e.g., AWS Access Key, Secret Key, client secrets for Azure, etc.).
- Feed Configuration Data: Configuration settings for feeds, which may include sensitive information such as URIs, endpoints, and sensitive options.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES

- User Environment to Terraform Provider: Boundary between the users running Terraform and the provider code.
- Terraform Provider to Chronicle APIs: Boundary between the provider and external Chronicle APIs over the network.
- Local Development Environment to GitHub Repository: Boundary between developers' local code and the public source code repository.
- User System to Terraform State Storage: Boundary between the user's system and where the Terraform state files are stored (local or remote backends).
- Provider to Feed Configuration Inputs: Boundary between the provider and user-supplied feed configurations, including sensitive authentication data.

## DATA FLOWS

- User Configurations to Provider: Users provide configurations, including feed configurations, that are processed by the Terraform provider.
- Provider to Chronicle APIs: The provider sends requests, including feed configurations and credentials, to Chronicle APIs using user-supplied credentials.
- GitHub Repository to User Systems: Users clone or download the provider code from the repository.
- Provider Logging: The provider may log information during execution, potentially including sensitive data from feed configurations.
- State File Storage: Terraform state files are written to local or remote storage, possibly crossing system boundaries.

*Data flows crossing trust boundaries:*

- User Configurations to Provider: Crossing from user-controlled inputs into the provider execution environment (including feed configurations with sensitive data).
- Provider to Chronicle APIs: Crossing from the provider to external services over the network (including feed configuration data and credentials).
- Provider Logging: Potential exposure of sensitive data in logs crossing from secure context to potentially less secure storage.
- State File Storage: State files moving from the provider to storage backends, potentially exposing sensitive data.

Review error handling to ensure that sensitive credentials are not included in logs or error messages. Provide guidance to developers and users on secure logging practices. | Medium likelihood, especially if detailed logging is enabled during troubleshooting.                            | High impact as exposure of feed credentials can lead to unauthorized access to external data sources like AWS S3, Azure Blobstore, etc.             | High          |

Consider implementing certificate pinning if appropriate. Keep dependencies up to date to benefit from security fixes in underlying libraries.                                        | Low likelihood due to default TLS enforcement, but potential risks from vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.   | High impact as interception of communications could lead to data exposure or tampering with provider operations.                                   | Medium        |

Advise users to enable state encryption and avoid committing state files to source control. Consider implementing mechanisms to redact sensitive data from state files if possible. | High likelihood if users are unaware of the risks and store state files insecurely.                               | High impact as exposure of feed credentials can lead to unauthorized access to external data sources and compromise of infrastructure.             | High          |

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

**Questions**:

- Are there any secure logging practices in place to prevent logging of feed authentication credentials?
- Are feed configurations encrypted or redacted when stored in state files?
- Is there input validation implemented for feed configuration parameters to prevent injection attacks?
- Does the provider enforce SSL/TLS configurations or support certificate pinning for communications with Chronicle APIs?
- How are rate limiters configured in the provider? Are they sufficient to prevent denial of service?
- Are there processes for regularly auditing and updating third-party dependencies for vulnerabilities?
- What guidance is provided to users regarding the secure handling of credentials and state files?

**Assumptions**:

- Users may not always follow best practices for securing credentials and configurations.
- The provider relies on Terraform's mechanisms for state management without additional safeguards.
- The build and deployment processes do not currently include advanced security measures like code signing.
- Network communications use standard HTTPS without additional security enhancements.
- The GitHub repository is the primary source of the provider code, and repository settings determine its security posture.
- Feed configurations and credentials are handled in plaintext unless additional security measures are implemented by users.
- The provider's logging and error handling may not adequately prevent the exposure of sensitive data without explicit safeguards.

The goal of this threat model is to identify realistic threats based on the provided project files and to prioritize mitigation efforts accordingly. The focus is on protecting sensitive assets, ensuring the integrity and availability of the Terraform provider, and safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities in the application, deployment, and build processes.
