## Threat Model for Applications Using Terraform Chronicle

This document outlines the potential security threats introduced by using the `terraform-provider-chronicle`. It focuses specifically on risks associated with the provider itself and its interaction with Chronicle, excluding general web application security concerns.

### Threat List

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Chronicle API Credentials in Terraform State
    *   **Description:** Attackers gaining access to the Terraform state file could retrieve sensitive credentials used to authenticate with the Chronicle API. This could happen if the state file is stored insecurely (e.g., unencrypted storage, publicly accessible buckets). With these credentials, an attacker could perform any action allowed by the associated Chronicle account, such as reading ingested data, modifying rules, or deleting resources.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of the Chronicle environment, leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Terraform Provider Configuration (specifically the `backstoryapi_credentials`, `bigqueryapi_credentials`, `ingestionapi_credentials`, `forwarderapi_credentials` attributes in the provider configuration and the `authentication` blocks within feed resources). The `client.GetCredentials` function in `client/client.go` handles loading these credentials. The `multiEnvSearch` and `envSearch` functions in `chronicle/util.go` facilitate retrieving credentials from environment variables.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The provider allows specifying credentials via environment variables (e.g., `CHRONICLE_BIGQUERY_CREDENTIALS`), which can reduce the risk of them being directly embedded in the Terraform configuration. The documentation also mentions that sensitive attributes like `secret_access_key`, `sas_token`, `shared_key`, `client_secret`, and API tokens are marked as sensitive in the schema, which should prevent them from being displayed in plain text in `terraform plan` output. However, they are still stored in the state file. The provider also supports separate `*_access_token` attributes, potentially allowing for more granular control if access tokens with limited scopes are used.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Enforce or recommend the use of secure state backends with encryption (e.g., AWS S3 with encryption, Azure Storage with encryption, HashiCorp Consul).
        *   Consider integrating with HashiCorp Vault or other secrets management solutions to avoid storing credentials directly in the Terraform configuration or state.
        *   Implement regular rotation of API keys and credentials.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Azure Blob Storage Credentials in Terraform State
    *   **Description:** Attackers gaining access to the Terraform state file could retrieve sensitive credentials (shared key or SAS token) used to authenticate with Azure Blob Storage for `chronicle_azure_blobstore` resources. This could happen if the state file is stored insecurely. With these credentials, an attacker could potentially access the configured Azure Blob Storage container, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting logs before they are ingested by Chronicle, or even injecting malicious data.
    *   **Impact:** High. Potential for data loss, data manipulation, or injection of malicious data in the Azure Blob Storage, impacting the integrity of ingested logs.
    *   **Affected Component:** `chronicle_azure_blobstore` resource (specifically the `details.authentication.shared_key` attributes) as defined in `examples\resources\feed\azure_blobstore\main.tf`.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The `shared_key` attribute is marked as sensitive in the schema, which should prevent it from being displayed in plain text in `terraform plan` output. However, it is still stored in the state file.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Enforce or recommend the use of secure state backends with encryption.
        *   Consider integrating with HashiCorp Vault or other secrets management solutions to avoid storing credentials directly in the Terraform configuration or state.
        *   Implement regular rotation of Azure Blob Storage keys or SAS tokens.
        *   Explore using managed identities for authentication where applicable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Microsoft Office 365 Credentials in Terraform State
    *   **Description:** Attackers gaining access to the Terraform state file could retrieve sensitive credentials (OAuth client ID and client secret) used to authenticate with the Microsoft Office 365 Management Activity API for `chronicle_feed_microsoft_office_365_management_activity` resources. This could happen if the state file is stored insecurely. With these credentials, an attacker could potentially access the Office 365 Management Activity API and retrieve audit logs, potentially gaining access to sensitive organizational information.
    *   **Impact:** High. Potential for unauthorized access to sensitive audit logs from Microsoft Office 365.
    *   **Affected Component:** `chronicle_feed_microsoft_office_365_management_activity` resource (specifically the `details.authentication.client_id` and `details.authentication.client_secret` attributes) as defined in `examples\resources\feed\api\microsoft_office_365_management_activity\main.tf`.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The `client_secret` attribute is marked as sensitive in the schema, which should prevent it from being displayed in plain text in `terraform plan` output. However, the `client_id` is not marked as sensitive, and both are stored in the state file.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Enforce or recommend the use of secure state backends with encryption.
        *   Consider integrating with HashiCorp Vault or other secrets management solutions to avoid storing credentials directly in the Terraform configuration or state.
        *   Implement regular rotation of Office 365 application secrets.
        *   Mark the `client_id` attribute as sensitive in the schema.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

        *   Consider integrating with HashiCorp Vault or other secrets management solutions to avoid storing the credentials directly in the Terraform configuration or state.
        *   Implement regular rotation of Proofpoint SIEM secrets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Qualys VM Credentials in Terraform State
    *   **Description:** Attackers gaining access to the Terraform state file could retrieve the sensitive Qualys VM credentials (username and password) used for authentication in the `chronicle_feed_qualys_vm` resource. This could happen if the state file is stored insecurely. With these credentials, an attacker could potentially access the Qualys VM API and retrieve vulnerability data.
    *   **Impact:** High. Potential for unauthorized access to Qualys VM vulnerability data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `chronicle_feed_qualys_vm` resource (specifically the `details.authentication.user` and `details.authentication.secret` attributes) as defined in `examples\resources\feed\api\qualys_vm\main.tf`.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The `secret` attribute within the `authentication` block is marked as sensitive in the schema, which should prevent it from being displayed in plain text in `terraform plan` output. However, it is still stored in the state file.

        *   Consider integrating with HashiCorp Vault or other secrets management solutions to avoid storing the API key directly in the Terraform configuration or state.
        *   Implement regular rotation of Thinkst Canary API keys.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Modification of Chronicle Rules
    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the Terraform configuration could modify or delete existing Chronicle rules by altering the `chronicle_rule` resource definitions. This could disable critical detection logic, allowing malicious activity to go unnoticed. They could also introduce new, less strict rules or rules that exfiltrate data. The `client.CreateRule`, `client.CreateRuleVersion`, `client.ChangeAlertingRule`, `client.ChangeLiveRule`, and `client.DeleteRule` functions in `client/rule.go` are used to manage rules.
    *   **Impact:** High. Significant impact on security monitoring capabilities, potentially leading to delayed incident detection and response.
    *   **Affected Component:** `chronicle_rule` resource as defined in `examples\resources\detection\rule\main.tf`.
    *   **Current Mitigations:**  None specific to the provider. Standard Terraform practices for managing access to the configuration files apply.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement strict access control policies for the Terraform repository and state backend.
        *   Utilize code review processes for all Terraform changes.
        *   Consider using Terraform Cloud or Enterprise for enhanced collaboration and access control features.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting on changes to Chronicle rules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Modification of Chronicle Feed Configurations
    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the Terraform configuration could modify Chronicle feed configurations (e.g., `chronicle_feed_amazon_s3`, `chronicle_feed_okta_system_log`, `chronicle_azure_blobstore`, `chronicle_google_cloud_storage_bucket`, `chronicle_feed_microsoft_office_365_management_activity`, `chronicle_feed_okta_users`, `chronicle_feed_proofpoint_siem`, `chronicle_feed_qualys_vm`, `chronicle_feed_thinkst_canary`). This could involve changing the data sources, altering authentication details, or disabling feeds entirely, leading to gaps in data ingestion and security monitoring. For example, an attacker could change the S3 URI in an Amazon S3 feed to point to a malicious bucket, disable a critical log source, or modify authentication details for an Okta or Thinkst Canary feed. The `client.CreateFeed` and `client.UpdateFeed` functions in `client/feed.go` are used to manage feeds.
    *   **Impact:** High. Disruption of security data ingestion, leading to blind spots in security monitoring and potential data loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** All `chronicle_feed_*` resources, such as those defined in `examples\resources\feed\*`. The specific configuration details are defined in the respective resource files.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** None specific to the provider. Standard Terraform practices for managing access to the configuration files apply.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement strict access control policies for the Terraform repository and state backend.
        *   Utilize code review processes for all Terraform changes.
        *   Consider using Terraform Cloud or Enterprise for enhanced collaboration and access control features.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting on changes to Chronicle feed configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation through RBAC Subject Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the Terraform configuration could modify the roles assigned to subjects using the `chronicle_rbac_subject` resource. This could allow them to grant themselves or other unauthorized users elevated privileges within the Chronicle environment, enabling them to perform actions beyond their intended scope. The `client.CreateSubject` and `client.UpdateSubject` functions in `client/subject.go` are used to manage subjects.
    *   **Impact:** High. Unauthorized access to sensitive Chronicle functionalities and data, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** `chronicle_rbac_subject` resource as defined in `examples\resources\rbac\subject\main.tf`.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** None specific to the provider. Standard Terraform practices for managing access to the configuration files apply.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement strict access control policies for the Terraform repository and state backend.
        *   Utilize code review processes for all Terraform changes, especially those involving RBAC configurations.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting on changes to Chronicle RBAC subject configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Information Disclosure through Verbose Debug Logging
    *   **Description:** If the Terraform provider is run in debug mode (using the `-debug` flag or the `debug.sh` script), sensitive information, including API requests and responses, which might contain credentials or other confidential data, could be logged to the console or debug logs. An attacker gaining access to these logs could potentially extract sensitive information. The logging is handled within the `client/transport.go` file.
    *   **Impact:** Medium. Potential exposure of sensitive credentials or configuration details.
    *   **Affected Component:** Provider's debugging functionality (controlled by the `-debug` flag in `main.go` and the `debug.sh` script). The `loggingTransport` in `client/client.go` is responsible for this logging.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The documentation doesn't explicitly warn against using debug mode in production.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Clearly document the risks associated with running the provider in debug mode and advise against its use in production environments.
        *   Ensure that debug logs, if enabled for troubleshooting, are stored securely and access is restricted.
        *   Consider implementing more granular control over debug logging to avoid logging sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium

*   **Threat:** Manipulation of Reference Lists for Malicious Purposes
    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the Terraform configuration could modify the contents of Chronicle reference lists using the `chronicle_reference_list` resource. This could be used to inject malicious IPs, domains, or other indicators into lists used for detection or blocking, potentially leading to false positives or false negatives in security alerts and responses. The `client.CreateReferenceList` and `client.UpdateReferenceList` functions in `client/reference_list.go` are used to manage reference lists.
    *   **Impact:** Medium. Degradation of the effectiveness of security rules and alerts, potentially leading to missed threats or unnecessary alerts.
    *   **Affected Component:** `chronicle_reference_list` resource as defined in `examples\resources\reference_lists\main.tf`.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** None specific to the provider. Standard Terraform practices for managing access to the configuration files apply.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement strict access control policies for the Terraform repository and state backend.
        *   Utilize code review processes for all Terraform changes, especially those involving reference list modifications.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting on changes to Chronicle reference lists.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium

*   **Threat:** Redirection of API Traffic via Custom Endpoints
    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the Terraform configuration could modify the `*_custom_endpoint` attributes in the provider configuration (e.g., `events_custom_endpoint`, `rule_custom_endpoint`). This could redirect API calls intended for Chronicle to an attacker-controlled server. This allows the attacker to intercept API requests and potentially steal credentials or manipulate responses, leading to unexpected behavior or data breaches. The base paths are configured in `client/client.go` and the validation is done by `validateCustomEndpoint` in `chronicle/validation.go`.
    *   **Impact:** High. Potential for credential theft, manipulation of Chronicle data, and disruption of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Terraform Provider Configuration (specifically the `*_custom_endpoint` attributes in `provider.go`). The base paths are generated in `client/endpoints.go`.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The provider includes validation functions (`validateCustomEndpoint`) for these custom endpoint URLs, which might prevent obviously invalid URLs. However, it doesn't prevent the use of malicious but syntactically valid URLs.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Document the risks associated with using custom endpoints and advise caution.
        *   Consider implementing a mechanism to verify the authenticity or trustworthiness of custom endpoints, although this might be complex.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for changes to the provider configuration, especially the custom endpoint settings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Abuse of Source Deletion Options in Feed Configurations
    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the Terraform configuration could modify the `source_delete_options` attribute in feed resources (e.g., `chronicle_feed_amazon_s3`, `chronicle_feed_amazon_sqs`, `chronicle_google_cloud_storage_bucket`). By setting this to `SOURCE_DELETION_ON_SUCCESS` or `SOURCE_DELETION_ON_SUCCESS_FILES_ONLY`, the attacker could cause the deletion of source logs even if ingestion was not successful from the perspective of the security team, leading to data loss and hindering investigations. Conversely, setting it to `SOURCE_DELETION_NEVER` for feeds with high data volume could lead to increased storage costs for the victim. The validation for these options is in `chronicle/validation.go`.
    *   **Impact:** Medium. Potential for data loss or increased storage costs.
    *   **Affected Component:** `chronicle_feed_amazon_s3`, `chronicle_feed_amazon_sqs`, and `chronicle_google_cloud_storage_bucket` resources (specifically the `source_delete_options` attribute) as defined in `examples\resources\feed\amazon_s3\main.tf`, `examples\resources\feed\amazon_sqs\main.tf`, and `examples\resources\feed\google_cloud_storage_bucket\main.tf`.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** None specific to the provider. Standard Terraform practices for managing access to the configuration files apply.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement strict access control policies for the Terraform repository and state backend.
        *   Utilize code review processes for all Terraform changes, especially those involving feed configurations.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting on changes to the `source_delete_options` attribute in feed configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium

*   **Threat:** Insufficient Input Validation
    *   **Description:** The provider relies on validation functions (present in `chronicle/validation.go`) for various inputs, such as credentials, regions, and source types. If these validations are incomplete, incorrect, or missing for certain fields, it could lead to unexpected behavior, API errors, or potentially exploitable vulnerabilities. For example, a missing validation for a specific field in a feed configuration could allow an attacker to inject malicious data.
    *   **Impact:** Medium. Could lead to service disruption, unexpected errors, or in some cases, the ability to inject malicious data or bypass security controls.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Various resource configurations and provider inputs. The validation functions are located in `chronicle/validation.go`.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The provider implements several validation functions for different input types. For example, `validateCredentials`, `validateRegion`, `validateFeedS3SourceType`, etc.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Conduct a thorough review of all resource attributes and provider inputs to ensure comprehensive validation is in place.
        *   Implement unit tests specifically for validation functions to ensure they behave as expected and cover edge cases.
        *   Consider using schema validation provided by the Terraform Plugin Framework more extensively.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium

*   **Threat:** Misconfiguration through Environment Variables
    *   **Description:** The provider supports configuring API credentials and other settings via environment variables (e.g., `CHRONICLE_BIGQUERY_CREDENTIALS`). If these environment variables are not handled securely or if there are inconsistencies in how they are processed (e.g., different precedence rules), it could lead to misconfigurations. An attacker who can control the environment where Terraform is executed might be able to inject malicious credentials or alter settings. The `multiEnvSearch` and `envSearch` functions in `chronicle/util.go`, and the `GetCredentials` function in `client/client.go` handle environment variables.
    *   **Impact:** High. Potential for unauthorized access to Chronicle APIs, leading to data breaches or service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Provider configuration, specifically the logic for retrieving credentials from environment variables in `client/client.go`.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The provider uses specific environment variable names for credentials.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Clearly document the supported environment variables and their precedence.
        *   Advise users on securely managing environment variables, especially in CI/CD pipelines.
        *   Consider providing options to restrict the use of environment variables for sensitive settings in favor of more secure methods like secrets management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Potential DoS through lack of rate limiting on client-side
    *   **Description:** While the Chronicle API itself likely has rate limiting, the Terraform provider might not have sufficient client-side rate limiting for all API calls. An attacker with control over the Terraform configuration or execution environment could potentially trigger a large number of API requests in a short period, potentially leading to denial of service on the Chronicle API or impacting the performance of the Chronicle environment. The rate limiters are defined in `client/endpoints.go`.
    *   **Impact:** Medium. Could lead to temporary disruption of Chronicle services or impact performance.
    *   **Affected Component:** The API client implementation in `client/*.go`, specifically the functions that make API calls.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The provider implements rate limiters for some API calls as defined in `client/endpoints.go`.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Review all API interactions and ensure appropriate client-side rate limiting is implemented for all critical operations, especially those that could be easily abused.
        *   Make the rate limits configurable or provide guidance on appropriate settings.
        *   Implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures in case of API overload.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium

*   **Threat:** Local File Inclusion via `file()` function in `chronicle_rule`
    *   **Description:** The `chronicle_rule` resource allows specifying the `rule_text` using the `file()` function. If an attacker gains write access to the Terraform configuration, they could potentially provide a path to a sensitive local file on the machine where Terraform is being executed. The content of this file would then be included in the rule text sent to the Chronicle API. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information contained within that file. The `file()` function usage is demonstrated in `examples\resources\detection\rule\main.tf` and the file reading logic is in `client\util.go` within the `pathOrContents` function.
    *   **Impact:** High. Potential disclosure of sensitive information from the local filesystem where Terraform is executed.
    *   **Affected Component:** `chronicle_rule` resource, specifically the `rule_text` attribute when using the `file()` function. The `pathOrContents` function in `client\util.go` is responsible for reading the file.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** None specific to the provider. Standard Terraform practices for managing access to the configuration files apply.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Clearly document the security implications of using the `file()` function and advise caution.
        *   Recommend or enforce the use of remote storage for rule files instead of local paths.
        *   Implement checks or warnings if the `file()` function is used with paths outside of a designated safe directory.
        *   Consider if the `file()` function is strictly necessary or if there are alternative ways to provide rule content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
