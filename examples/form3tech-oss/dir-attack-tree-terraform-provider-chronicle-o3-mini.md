Below is an attack‐tree analysis tailored to the terraform‐provider‑chronicle codebase. In our view the ultimate adversary’s goal is to “compromise or abuse systems that use terraform‑provider‑chronicle by exploiting weaknesses in its configuration, resource input parsing, credential handling, and build/distribution process.”

Below, we (1) briefly summarize the project and its key components, (2) define the ultimate goal, (3) list the high‐level attack paths and their detailed steps, (4) indicate logical relationships among subgoals using AND/OR, (5) assign sample attributes (likelihood, impact, effort, required skill, detection difficulty) to each node, and (6) provide a text‐based visualization of the attack tree.

## 1. Overview of the Project

• **Purpose and Functionality**
 – This project implements a Terraform provider for Chronicle. It lets users manage Chronicle resources (feeds, alerts, rules, RBAC subjects, reference lists, etc.) via Terraform.
 – It supports multiple feed resource types (Amazon S3, Amazon SQS, Azure Blobstore, Google Cloud Storage Bucket, various API‐based feeds like Office 365, Okta, Proofpoint, Qualys, Thinkst Canary) and also resources for rule creation and RBAC subject management.

• **Key Components**
 – **Provider Configuration**: Accepts credentials (via file, inline string, environment variables) for several Chronicle APIs (Backstory, Ingestion, Forwarder, BigQuery). Custom endpoints can also be configured.
 – **Resource Implementations**: Each resource (feed, rule, rbac subject, reference list) defines its own schema, expands inputs into concrete API payloads and handles API responses.
 – **Client Libraries**: The “client” package builds HTTP clients (with rate‐limiting, token handling, retries) to communicate with Chronicle APIs.
 – **Build and Distribution**: Build scripts, linting, and a goreleaser configuration support building a cross‑platform binary.

• **Dependencies & Sensitive Data**
 – The provider uses Go modules (terraform-plugin‑sdk/v2, google oauth2, and others) to build and sign API calls.
 – It handles sensitive authentication data (such as API keys and secrets) via explicit “Sensitive” marks and by supporting environment‑variable overrides.

## 2. Root Goal

**Ultimate Adversary Goal:**
“Achieve unauthorized compromise or abuse of systems using terraform‑provider‑chronicle by exploiting weaknesses in its design, configuration and processing of sensitive inputs.”

That is, if an attacker can (for example) manipulate provider configuration or resource definitions—or even compromise the build/distribution pipeline—they might subvert API calls, inject malicious behavior, exfiltrate secrets, or trigger a denial‐of‐service in production environments.

---

## 3. High‑Level Attack Paths and Detailed Steps

Below are the major attack paths an adversary might consider:

### A. Exploit Custom Endpoint Configuration
 • **Description:** The provider lets users override endpoints (for events, alerts, artifacts, alias, asset, IOC, rule, subjects) via both configuration and environment variables.
 • **Steps:**
  – **A1.** *Supply Malicious Custom Endpoints:*
   ◦ The attacker (or malicious insider) provides forged endpoint URLs in provider configuration (or via environment variables).
  – **A2.** *API Redirection:*
   ◦ The provider “builds” API URLs from these endpoints and sends credential‐rich API calls to the attacker–controlled server.
  – **A3.** *Data/Secret Exfiltration:*
   ◦ The attacker intercepts sensitive credentials and request payloads to exfiltrate data or manipulate API operations.

### B. Abuse Credential Input Processing
 • **Description:** The provider accepts strings for credentials that may be interpreted as either a file path or literal JSON content.
 • **Steps:**
  – **B1.** *Malicious Credential Input as File:*
   ◦ By supplying a string that is an absolute or relative file path, an attacker may cause the provider to read unintended local files (if placed in a configuration file by a malicious actor).
  – **B2.** *Manipulate Environment Variables:*
   ◦ If an adversary already has influence over the build environment or configuration, they might set environment variables (e.g. CHRONICLE_BACKSTORY_CREDENTIALS) to attacker‑controlled values to divert authentication.

### C. Exploit Malformed Resource Configurations
 • **Description:** The provider “expands” resource blocks (feed, rule, RBAC subject, reference list) by reading arbitrary user‑provided HCL data and converting it via type assertions.
 • **Steps:**
  – **C1.** *Inject Malformed Input:*
   ◦ An attacker (or careless/malicious user) supplies resource blocks with unexpected field types or extremely large values.
   ◦ For example, supplying non‑string data where a string is expected may trigger type panics during the “readSliceFromResource” or similar functions.
  – **C2.** *Trigger DoS or Erratic Behavior:*
   ◦ This could force the provider into a panic (causing a denial‐of‑service) or disrupt proper API payload construction.

### D. Abuse Debug Mode and Logging
 • **Description:** A debug mode exists (and a debug.sh script) that launches the provider under a debugger (e.g. Delve) with verbose output.
 • **Steps:**
  – **D1.** *Enable Debug Mode:*
   ◦ An attacker or insider sets the “debug” flag at runtime.
  – **D2.** *Attach a Debugger and Extract Sensitive Data:*
   ◦ With debug mode enabled, the provider prints additional details (gRPC debug info, environment variable values) and may permit debugger attachment for live inspection.
   ◦ This could reveal sensitive configuration and secret values.

### E. Manipulate Rule Text Processing
 • **Description:** The “chronicle_rule” resource takes a YARA‑L 2.0 rule text (which must end with a newline) and submits it for verification and compilation.
 • **Steps:**
  – **E1.** *Submit Oversized/Malicious YARA Rules:*
   ◦ An attacker might supply a rule text that is extremely large or deliberately crafted (with subtle syntax differences) to stress the verification endpoint or trigger unexpected behavior.
  – **E2.** *Abuse Verification Process:*
   ◦ If the verifyYARARule function is mis‑implemented or if the Chronicle API mis‐processes the rule text, this could lead to denial-of-service or rule mis‑compilation that weakens detection logic.

### F. Supply Chain Compromise in the Build/Distribution Process
 • **Description:** The build and release pipeline (using GitHub Actions and goreleaser) is part of the provider’s security surface.
 • **Steps:**
  – **F1.** *Compromise CI/CD Pipeline:*
   ◦ An attacker targets GitHub workflows (ci.yaml, release.yaml, lint.yaml) or the goreleaser configuration to inject malicious code.
  – **F2.** *Distribute a Malicious Provider:*
   ◦ A compromised build may produce a provider binary that includes backdoors (e.g. silently exfiltrating credentials or modifying resource behavior).
   ◦ This malicious provider is then distributed to unsuspecting users.

### G. Abuse of Third‑Party Dependencies
 • **Description:** The provider relies on many external libraries (for JSON, OAuth, HTTP, etc.).
 • **Steps:**
  – **G1.** *Exploit Vulnerability in a Dependency:*
   ◦ An attacker finds and exploits a vulnerability (for example in the regexp, JSON unmarshalling, or rate‑limiting libraries) leading to unexpected code execution or denial‑of‑service.
  – **G2.** *Trigger Unforeseen Behavior:*
   ◦ Malformed input might trigger unhandled exceptions if a dependency behaves unexpectedly.

## 4. Logical Operators and Relationships

• **Custom Endpoint (Path A)** and **Credential Abuse (Path B)** are both independent ways to compromise API communications. (OR relationship)
• **Malformed Resource Configurations (Path C)** and **Debug Mode Abuse (Path D)** are independent additional vectors.
• **Rule Text Manipulation (Path E)** is a “niche” attack that, while not as probable, might be effective in disrupting detection logic. (OR)
• **Supply Chain Attack (Path F)** is separate and, if successful, undermines the entire trust model.
• **Third‑Party Abuse (Path G)** may serve either as a “vector multiplier” or an alternate route.
• Overall, if any of these paths succeed, the ultimate goal is achieved.

Some steps must be executed in sequence (AND) while others present alternative choices (OR) for an attacker.

## 7. Summary of Findings and Recommendations

**Key Risks:**
- **Custom Endpoint abuse** (Path A) is a likely vector if an attacker can influence provider configuration.
- **Credential input abuse** (Path B) could lead to inadvertent file reads and leakage.
- **Malformed configuration inputs** (Path C) may cause panics and service interruptions.
- **Debug mode abuse** (Path D) poses a risk if operational debugging is mis‑configured or left enabled in production.
- **Supply chain compromise** (Path F) and dependency vulnerabilities (Path G) have lower likelihood but extremely high impact.

**Recommended Mitigations:**
- **Validate and constrain custom endpoint inputs** (e.g. enforce HTTPS and whitelisted domains).
- **Improve parsing and error‐handling of resource inputs** to gracefully handle unexpected types.
- **Audit and restrict debug mode usage** so that it cannot run in production or reveal sensitive details.
- **Ensure secure CI/CD practices** (code signing, minimal privilege accounts, reproducible builds) to protect against supply‐chain attacks.
- **Keep dependencies up‑to‑date and monitor for vulnerabilities** in third‑party libraries.
