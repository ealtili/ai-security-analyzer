# BUSINESS POSTURE

The terraform-provider-chronicle project is built to enable organizations to manage Chronicle security resources using Terraform. The provider translates Terraform configuration into API calls for resource types such as feeds (for data ingestion from sources like Amazon S3, Amazon SQS, Azure Blobstore, Google Cloud Storage, and various API feeds including Office365 management activity, Okta logs, Proofpoint SIEM, Qualys VM, and Thinkst Canary), rule management, RBAC subject configuration, and reference lists.

Business priorities include:
- Enabling infrastructure-as-code management for Chronicle resources.
- Providing automation and repeatability for security operations and incident response processes.
- Facilitating multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud security integrations with a common configuration language.
- Maintaining a high degree of reliability and agility while reducing manual intervention.

Key business risks involve:
- Misconfiguration of critical security resources leading to unintended changes in log ingestion or detection rules.
- Exposure of sensitive credentials and API tokens.
- Supply-chain risks due to reliance on multiple third-party libraries and integrations.
- Integration failures with underlying Chronicle API endpoints which may impact security monitoring.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Sensitive attributes (e.g. secret_access_key, client_secret, sas_token, etc.) are flagged as sensitive in the Terraform schema.
- security control: Credentials can be provided either directly or via environment variables; environment variables are given the lowest precedence to minimize accidental exposure.
- security control: Input validation is enforced via regular expressions and dedicated validation functions (see validation.go) for fields such as AWS keys, UUIDs, and URIs.
- security control: HTTPS/TLS is used by the client for secure API communications.
- security control: Rate limiters and retry logic (in client/transport.go) help prevent abuse and handle transient errors.
- security control: Continuous integration pipelines (GitHub Actions workflows) enforce code formatting (gofmt), linting (golangci-lint), testing (unit and acceptance tests), and build verification.
- security control: The build process in the Makefile incorporates dependency management using go mod and vendor directories.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Acceptance tests may run using real resource creation and may require the use of production-like credentials.
- accepted risk: A large number of external dependencies introduces inherent supply-chain risks that are managed by version pinning and vendor directories.
- accepted risk: The providerâ€™s API calls rely on the security model of external Chronicle services.

Recommended additional security controls:
- recommended security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) into the CI process.
- recommended security control: Introduce dependency vulnerability scanning to automatically alert on insecure third-party packages.
- recommended security control: Implement supply-chain security measures such as binary signing and reproducible builds.
- recommended security control: Enhance audit logging of API requests (while ensuring that sensitive data is not logged) to improve incident detection.
- recommended security control: Evaluate and implement secrets management integration so that credentials are rotated and stored safely.

Security requirements for the project:
- authentication: Robust handling of credentials via environment variables and direct inputs with sensitive fields masked.
- authorization: Rigid input validation and API token usage ensure only authorized calls are made to Chronicle endpoints.
- input validation: All API inputs are validated using regex-based validators and schema constraints.
- cryptography: Secure communications over HTTPS using TLS are enforced throughout the client code.

Areas of implementation:
- The Terraform schema explicitly marks sensitive fields.
- Validation functions in validation.go enforce proper formats for credentials, UUIDs, URIs, and other inputs.
- GitHub Actions workflows run multiple security-related steps (gofmtcheck, lint, tests) prior to merging.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes:
- Continuous ingestion of security logs from cloud storage and various API sources.
- Management and update of detection rules for threat and incident response.
- Configuration and maintenance of RBAC subjects and reference lists to enforce access controls.

Data protection concerns:
- API credentials and tokens along with sensitive authentication information need to be protected from exposure.
- Detection rule texts and configuration details may contain sensitive information about an organizationâ€™s security posture.
- Logs and metadata retrieved from Chronicle APIs are sensitive and must be communicated over secure channels.

Sensitivity:
- The data managed by the provider is highly sensitive, as it directly impacts an organizationâ€™s security monitoring and incident response capabilities. Unauthorized access or misconfiguration may lead to security breaches and operational disruption.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
1. What are the organizationâ€™s procedures for rotating and revoking API credentials?
2. How are audit logs from provider API interactions retained and monitored?
3. What is the expected frequency of updates and releases for the provider?
4. Which additional security scanning tools (SAST/DAST, dependency scanning) are planned for integration into the CI/CD pipeline?
5. Are there any specific compliance requirements that govern the handling of sensitive data in this provider?

Assumptions:
1. End users deploying the provider will follow best practices for credential management (using environment variables, secure storage, etc.).
2. The underlying Chronicle APIs enforce strict authentication and authorization measures, reducing the risk at the provider level.
3. The CI/CD environment is secured and access to secrets is tightly controlled.
4. Dependency version pinning and vendor management are sufficient to mitigate supply-chain risks.
5. Business risk tolerance is moderate, and any potential issues with misconfiguration or secret exposure are accepted if proper logging and audit trails are maintained.
