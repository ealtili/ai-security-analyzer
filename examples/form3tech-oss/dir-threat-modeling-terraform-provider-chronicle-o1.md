## APPLICATION THREAT MODEL

### ASSETS
- Provider configuration data containing Chronicle API credentials. This includes either OAuth tokens or JSON service account data.
- Environment variables that store sensitive credentials (for example, CHRONICLE_BACKSTORY_CREDENTIALS, CHRONICLE_BIGQUERY_CREDENTIALS, etc.).
- Local Terraform files (HCL) that reference or define Chronicle resources.
- Provider state data that might contain resource IDs, references, or possibly partial credentials used for debugging.
- Generated or stored logs containing debugging information that might inadvertently expose secrets or internal states.

### TRUST BOUNDARIES
- Boundary between the Terraform user/system (the local environment) and the Terraform Chronicle Provider code.
- Boundary between the Terraform Chronicle Provider and Chronicle APIs (external Google Chronicle endpoints).
- Boundary between the provider code and the environment variables (operating system environment).
- Boundary between local logs/debug info and the outside environment (since logs might be shared or stored in external systems).

### DATA FLOWS
- Input flows from environment variables or from .tf files into the provider to configure credentials and resource definitions.
- Outbound API calls from the provider to Chronicle endpoints to create, read, update, or delete resources in Chronicle. This crosses the boundary from local environment to Chronicle’s networks.
- Return data from Chronicle APIs back to the provider for processing, crossing from Chronicle’s network into the local environment.
- Provider debug logs optionally written to the user console or log files.
- Possible acceptance test flows that create real resources in Chronicle, pushing or pulling data from external endpoints.

### APPLICATION THREATS
1) Threat: Credential leakage via logs or misconfiguration.
   Description: Attackers might gain access to logs or debug output in which sensitive data (like tokens or environment variables) is accidentally printed.
   Impact: Exposure of secret credentials that allows unauthorized access to Chronicle resources.
   Affected Component: Logging and environment variable handling code in the provider.
   Current Mitigations: The code attempts to avoid printing secrets in logs, but if debug or trace logging is enabled, there is a risk of accidental exposure.
   Missing Mitigations: Systematic check or filter for secrets in logs, and user education to avoid running in overly verbose debug modes in production.
   Risk Severity: Medium.

2) Threat: Unauthorized read/write to resources due to unvalidated inputs in resource definitions.
   Description: If malicious or incorrect Terraform configurations are used, they may attempt to manipulate data or create unintended resources.
   Impact: Creation or modification of Chronicle feeds, rules, reference lists, or other data that could cause incorrect or detrimental security policies.
   Affected Component: Terraform resource definition parsing and the provider’s input validation.
   Current Mitigations: Basic validation in the provider code for resource fields.
   Missing Mitigations: Additional context-aware checks or constraints on resource updates (e.g., restricting certain features to privileged contexts).
   Risk Severity: Medium.

3) Threat: API endpoint misuse or injection.
   Description: Manipulating the provider to send specially crafted payloads to Chronicle APIs that might bypass rules or create unusual states.
   Impact: Could lead to erroneous feed configurations or corrupted rule definitions in Chronicle.
   Affected Component: API request building logic.
   Current Mitigations: The provider sets structured JSON payloads; the Chronicle API also validates requests server-side.
   Missing Mitigations: Strict input sanitization beyond standard constraints; rate limiting is mostly done server-side.
   Risk Severity: Low.

4) Threat: Credential exfiltration by a local attacker.
   Description: If an attacker has local access to the environment or the shell where Terraform runs, they could read environment variables or .tf files containing secrets.
   Impact: Full access to Chronicle’s environment if they can retrieve valid credentials.
   Affected Component: Any environment variable usage and local configuration files.
   Current Mitigations: Local OS permission controls, user instructions not to commit secrets in Git, etc.
   Missing Mitigations: Secret management solutions that never expose raw tokens (for instance, using vault references).
   Risk Severity: High.

5) Threat: Malicious modifications of local provider code or dependency.
   Description: If an attacker can modify or replace the provider binary or inject malicious libraries, they can intercept or redirect user credentials.
   Impact: Potential complete compromise of Chronicle resources.
   Affected Component: Provider binary, custom local builds.
   Current Mitigations: Provider distribution from a trusted platform (Terraform Registry, GitHub Releases).
   Missing Mitigations: Provider checksums or signature validation during installation.
   Risk Severity: High.


## DEPLOYMENT THREAT MODEL

### ASSETS
- Deployed Terraform Chronicle Provider Plugin binary on local or shared infrastructure.
- Credentials in environment variables or .terraform folders, or in a CI environment hosting Terraform runs.
- Chronicle resource definitions in Terraform code or in remote state backends (for example, if using Terraform Cloud or external state store).

### TRUST BOUNDARIES
- Boundary between the CI system or local host that runs Terraform and the Chronicle environment.
- Boundary between the plugin binaries in the Terraform environment and the network or local file system.
- Boundary between remote state storage (if used) and the local Terraform environment.

### DEPLOYMENT THREATS
1) Threat: Compromised Terraform state files in remote backend.
   Description: If the state is stored remotely and not properly protected, adversaries could read coverage of resource IDs or partial secrets.
   Impact: Unauthorized changes or read access to Chronicle resources.
   Affected Component: Remote state store.
   Current Mitigations: Terraform encryption at rest for some backends, IAM-based restrictions.
   Missing Mitigations: Additional encryption or restricted IAM for the state store.
   Risk Severity: Medium.

2) Threat: Injection of malicious environment variables or override files in CI.
   Description: Attackers who gain write access to the CI environment configuration can pass malicious credentials or override references.
   Impact: Could point the provider to malicious endpoints or leak real credentials.
   Affected Component: Infrastructure as code pipeline, environment variable management.
   Current Mitigations: Basic CI environment protections and credentials management.
   Missing Mitigations: Strict ephemeral secrets usage, restricting environment variable definitions to privileged contexts only.
   Risk Severity: High.

3) Threat: Unsecured deployments behind untrusted proxies.
   Description: If the environment runs Terraform in an unsecured network or behind a proxy that logs traffic, credentials might be intercepted.
   Impact: Potential credentials theft leading to unauthorized Chronicle access.
   Affected Component: Network path from Terraform environment to Chronicle APIs.
   Current Mitigations: TLS endpoints enforced by Chronicle.
   Missing Mitigations: Additional scanning for data exfil or logging in proxies.
   Risk Severity: Medium.

- Source code of the Terraform Chronicle Provider in GitHub.
- Build pipeline definitions (GitHub Actions, goreleaser configurations).
- Build artifacts published as GitHub releases or distributed to end users.
- Secrets or tokens in the GitHub repository that might be used to publish new releases.

### TRUST BOUNDARIES
- Boundary between the public GitHub environment and the internal code (public, but with controlled write access).
- Boundary between the build scripts (Makefile, goreleaser) and the secrets required for publishing.
- Boundary between the local developer environment and the official repository hosting the code.

### BUILD THREATS
1) Threat: Supply chain compromise in GitHub Actions.
   Description: Attackers might alter the CI configuration to inject malicious code or exfiltrate secrets.
   Impact: Malicious provider releases that steal credentials from end users.
   Affected Component: GitHub Actions pipeline and goreleaser steps.
   Current Mitigations: Basic branch protection, code review.
   Missing Mitigations: Verified or signed releases, restricted runner privileges.
   Risk Severity: High.

2) Threat: Unauthorized release publishing.
   Description: If an attacker obtains GitHub repository write access or secrets used by goreleaser, they can produce official releases that embed malware.
   Impact: Malicious provider distribution leading to wide credential compromise.
   Affected Component: GitHub release process.
   Current Mitigations: GitHub environment protection rules, commit signing.
   Missing Mitigations: Automated code scanning plus mandatory 2FA and restricted release permissions.
   Risk Severity: High.

3) Threat: Developer machine local environment compromise.
   Description: If a local contributor’s environment is compromised, malicious code could be committed.
   Impact: Potential injection of malicious code that might not be easily detected.
   Affected Component: Local developer machines that manage commits and build steps.
   Current Mitigations: Basic local machine security, ephemeral build environments in CI.
   Missing Mitigations: Strict commit signing, mandatory code review from multiple maintainers.
   Risk Severity: Medium.


## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
- Assumption that users store credentials securely and do not commit them to public version control.
- Assumption that environment variables containing secrets are protected by OS-level permissions and not exposed to untrusted processes.
- Assumption that user physically or logically secures the local environment or CI environment running Terraform.
- Question: Are there external secrets managers or vault integrations in use to further protect environment variables.
- Question: Is there any signing or verification mechanism for the downloaded provider binary.
- Assumption that Chronicle’s APIs enforce rate limits and input validation to reduce the impact of malicious or invalid requests.

These threats reflect typical risks for a Terraform provider that manages sensitive cloud resources. Some threats may be considered low likelihood but included for completeness. Where relevant mitigations are missing, teams can decide if such scenarios are significant enough to require additional controls.
