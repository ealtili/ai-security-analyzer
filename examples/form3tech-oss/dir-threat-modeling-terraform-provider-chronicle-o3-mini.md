# APPLICATION THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS
- Provider source code and compiled binary used to interact with Chronicle APIs.
- Sensitive credentials used for API access including backstory, bigquery, ingestion and forwarder credentials and access tokens.
- Terraform configuration files and state files that may contain sensitive information.
- API endpoint definitions and configuration endpoints for Chronicle.
- Logs produced by the provider that may inadvertently contain sensitive error information.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
- Boundary between the user’s Terraform configuration (and secrets provided via environment variables or files) and the provider plugin code.
- Boundary between the provider plugin (trusted code) and the external Chronicle APIs (untrusted network environment).
- Boundary between the local file system (where credentials and provider binaries reside) and the execution context of Terraform.
- Boundary between the build/CI environment and the production/provider binary distributed to end users.

## DATA FLOWS
- Flow of configuration data and credentials from user input (configuration files, environment variables, .terraformrc) to the provider plugin.
- Flow of sensitive data (credentials) used in HTTP requests from the provider to Chronicle API endpoints over TLS.
- Flow of API responses (including state details, rule compilations, errors) from Chronicle to the provider.
- Flow of build artifacts from the source code repository via the CI/CD pipeline to the release (and then installed by end users).

## APPLICATION THREATS
- Credential Exposure
  - Description: An attacker may intercept or access sensitive credentials (API keys, tokens and secret access keys) if they are improperly stored, logged, or transmitted.
  - Impact: Unauthorized access to Chronicle APIs; manipulation of critical data; unauthorized changes to environments.
  - Affected Component: Provider configuration handling and API client modules.
  - Current Mitigations: Sensitive fields are marked as sensitive in the Terraform resource schema; credentials are not printed in logs.
  - Missing Mitigations: Integration with centralized secret management and stronger encryption for credentials at rest.
  - Risk Severity: High

- Insecure Communication
  - Description: Data transmitted between the provider and Chronicle API endpoints might be intercepted if TLS is misconfigured or certificates are not verified.
  - Impact: Exposure of sensitive credentials and configuration data; potential session hijacking.
  - Affected Component: HTTP client implementation.
  - Current Mitigations: The provider uses Go’s HTTP client with HTTPS endpoints and relies on default TLS configuration.
  - Missing Mitigations: Certificate pinning and stricter TLS configuration settings.
  - Risk Severity: Medium

- Dependency Vulnerabilities
  - Description: The provider depends on a variety of third-party libraries. A vulnerability in any of these dependencies could compromise the provider.
  - Impact: Execution of arbitrary code, data leakage or further compromise of the environment.

  - Impact: Distribution of a malicious provider leading to compromise of all downstream Terraform deployments.
  - Affected Component: Build scripts (Makefile, goreleaser.yaml), GitHub workflows, and the CI/CD pipeline.
  - Current Mitigations: Usage of official GitHub actions and documented build procedures.
  - Missing Mitigations: Digital code signing of binaries, enhanced CI/CD security controls and periodic reviews of the supply chain.
  - Risk Severity: Critical

- Code Injection / Improper Input Validation
  - Description: Inadequate input validation in resource configurations might allow malformed or unexpected inputs, potentially leading to code injection or misbehavior.
  - Impact: Unexpected behavior in resource creation or rule evaluation.
  - Affected Component: Schema validation functions and resource expansion functions.
  - Current Mitigations: Custom validation functions are provided for many inputs.
  - Missing Mitigations: Additional fuzz testing and stricter sanitization of inputs.
  - Risk Severity: Low

- Error Handling and Information Disclosure
  - Description: Detailed error messages or stack traces may reveal internal implementation details to an attacker.
  - Impact: Increased information for an attacker to exploit underlying vulnerabilities.
  - Affected Component: Error handling routines in provider functions and client modules.
  - Current Mitigations: Errors are wrapped and some sensitive details are redacted.
  - Missing Mitigations: More rigorous sanitization of error outputs and centralized logging policies.
  - Risk Severity: Low

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
- Assumptions:
  - Chronicle API endpoints use HTTPS and enforce proper TLS configurations.
  - Sensitive credentials provided via environment variables or files are stored securely on user systems.
  - The provider user is expected to follow installation guidelines and use trusted release channels.
  - CI/CD credentials and secrets are managed securely with restricted access.
- Questions:
  - Are there plans to integrate with a centralized secrets management system (such as Vault) to further secure API credentials?
  - What additional measures are in place to ensure the digital integrity (code signing) of the provider binary at deployment?
  - How often are dependency scans and vulnerability assessments performed on third-party libraries?
  - Is there a formal process for auditing the CI/CD pipeline and ensuring that build environment credentials are rotated regularly?
- Notes:
  - Threats related to network-level interception are considered unlikely if standard TLS practices are maintained.
  - Some risks inherent in using third-party dependencies are accepted based on the quality and timeliness of dependency updates.
  - The current design relies heavily on the security of external services (Google APIs, GitHub) which are assumed to be robust.
