# APPLICATION THREAT MODEL

## Assets
- Provider source code containing the Terraform plugin implementation in Go. This includes all resource definitions, schema validations, API integration logic, and utility functions.
- Sensitive configuration data such as API credentials, access tokens, secret keys, and shared keys handled within provider configurations.
- Terraform state data containing resource identifiers and persisted provider state.
- Generated API requests and responses exchanged with Chronicle services (Backstory, Ingestion, Forwarder, etc.).
- User-supplied configuration files (e.g., provider blocks and resource examples).

## Trust Boundaries
- The boundary between user-supplied Terraform configuration (including sensitive credentials and custom endpoints) and the internal provider logic that processes and sends these credentials to external APIs.
- The boundary between the provider’s code running locally (as a plugin) and the external Chronicle API endpoints reached via HTTP.
- The separation of different API clients (e.g., BigQuery API client, Backstory API client) all sharing common configuration yet isolated by the provider’s credential handling.
- The boundary enforced by schema validation and custom validation functions (e.g., for AWS keys, UUIDs, URL formats) that separate trusted and untrusted input.

## Data Flows
- The user writes Terraform configuration that supplies credentials, endpoint URLs, and resource parameters; these inputs flow through the provider’s schema and validation functions.
- The provider constructs HTTP requests (with JSON payloads) using the configured values and sends them to the appropriate Chronicle API endpoints.
- Responses from Chronicle APIs (containing state or rule definitions) flow back into the provider and update the Terraform state.
- In the CI/CD and build process, source code is fetched from the repository; build scripts (Makefile, goreleaser configuration) and GitHub workflows assemble and publish the provider binary.

## Application Threats
- **Threat: Misconfiguration and Credential Leakage**
  - Description: If user inputs (such as API credentials or tokens) are not properly sanitized or are inadvertently exposed via verbose error messages or debug logs, an attacker may obtain sensitive information.
  - Impact: Exposure of API credentials and secret keys may lead to unauthorized API access and abuse of Chronicle services.
  - Affected Component: Credential handling functions in provider configuration (for example, the validateCredentials function and provider configuration in provider.go).
  - Current Mitigations: Sensitive attributes are marked in resource schemas; environment variables override file inputs; basic validation is performed on credential formats.
  - Missing Mitigations: Additional runtime filtering of sensitive information when logging errors and more strict error handling to ensure that sensitive data is never output.
  - Risk Severity: High

- **Threat: Insecure Custom Endpoint Input**
  - Description: The provider allows users to specify custom endpoints for various API calls. An attacker may supply a malformed or malicious URL that circumvents intended routing, possibly leading to server–side request forgery (SSRF) or redirection of sensitive requests.
  - Impact: Malicious redirection of API calls could lead to data exfiltration or unauthorized manipulation of API interactions.
  - Affected Component: Custom endpoint validation functions (validateCustomEndpoint) and related schema configuration.
  - Current Mitigations: Basic URL parsing is performed using standard library functions to check URI syntax.
  - Missing Mitigations: Stricter validation (such as domain whitelisting) and runtime checks to ensure that endpoints belong to expected Chronicle domains.
  - Risk Severity: Medium

- **Threat: Insecure Handling of Rule Text**
  - Description: The provider accepts rule text for rule resources. Although a newline is enforced at the end of the text via validation, manipulation of rule text content (or bypassing expected format) could lead to unexpected behavior in rule compilation or processing.
  - Impact: Improperly compiled rules may result in denial of service, misdetections, or failure to trigger intended alerts.
  - Affected Component: Resource creation and update functions in rule-related modules, particularly those relying on validateRuleText in resource_rule.go.
  - Current Mitigations: A validation function enforces that rule text ends with a newline, which helps maintain expected formatting.
  - Missing Mitigations: Additional content sanitization checks and structured parsing to catch other anomalies in rule text.
  - Risk Severity: Low

- **Threat: Inadequate Nested Field Validation in Resource Schemas**
  - Description: Nested blocks for AWS authentication, Okta credentials, Azure Blobstore settings, etc., must correctly validate input. Weak or incomplete validation in these schemas could allow malformed or malicious data that may not trigger proper API errors until later in processing.
  - Impact: Malformed configuration data could lead to API request errors, unexpected behavior, or, in a worst-case scenario, enable an attacker to inject unintended values into API calls.
  - Affected Component: Schema definitions and validation functions distributed across multiple resource files (e.g., for S3, SQS, Office 365, Okta).
  - Current Mitigations: Specific validations exist (such as for AWS access key format, UUID validation, URL validation, etc.).
  - Missing Mitigations: More comprehensive cross-field and contextual validation to ensure all nested inputs adhere strictly to expected formats.
  - Risk Severity: Medium

# DEPLOYMENT THREAT MODEL

## Assets
- The deployed provider binary installed in the user’s local Terraform environment.
- Configuration files used for installation (such as .terraformrc modifications) and Terraform state files.
- API responses and state persisted on the local disk by Terraform.

## Trust Boundaries
- The boundary between the user’s trusted system (local machine) and the provider binary, which might interact with untrusted network endpoints.
- The interface between the installed provider binary and externally hosted Chronicle APIs.
- The boundary between provider release artifacts (binary releases generated by goreleaser and CI workflows) and the end user’s download/installation process.

## Deployment Threats
- **Threat: Binary Tampering and Supply Chain Compromise**
  - Description: An attacker with control over the CI/CD pipeline or repository could insert malicious code into the provider binary before release. A compromised release could execute arbitrary code when loaded by Terraform.
  - Impact: Execution of malicious code in the user environment, leading to unauthorized API calls, data exfiltration, or system compromise.
  - Affected Component: The build and release process (GitHub Actions workflows, goreleaser configuration, release.yaml).
  - Current Mitigations: Use of official GitHub Actions versions and standard goreleaser practices.
  - Missing Mitigations: Code signing, artifact hash verification, and additional supply chain security controls.
  - Risk Severity: Critical

- **Threat: Misconfiguration of Provider Installation**
  - Description: Users might misconfigure the installation paths or provider plugin settings (for example, in the .terraformrc file) which may lead to execution of an unintended or malicious binary.
  - Impact: Loading an untrusted provider binary that may execute malicious operations in the user environment, potentially compromising Terraform state.
  - Affected Component: Deployment instructions and configuration files affecting provider installation.
  - Current Mitigations: Clear installation instructions are provided in the README.
  - Missing Mitigations: Automated integrity verification (e.g., checksum validation) of the installed binary.
  - Risk Severity: Medium

# BUILD THREAT MODEL

## Assets
- Source code repository (GitHub) storing all provider source files, configuration files, documentation, and examples.
- Build scripts and configuration files (GNUmakefile, goreleaser.yaml, GitHub workflow YAML files) used to compile and test the provider.
- Dependency specifications (go.mod and go.sum) and third-party libraries.
- Generated provider binaries and release artifacts published on GitHub.

## Trust Boundaries
- The boundary between source code contributions (from multiple developers) and the continuous integration (CI) system executing build and test processes.
- The separation between the project’s declared dependencies (as listed in go.mod) and external code repositories.
- The boundary between the local developer environment/CI environment and the released provider binary artifact.

## Build Threats
- **Threat: Supply Chain Attack via Dependencies**
  - Description: An attacker could compromise one or more third-party dependencies (or inject malicious code into a dependency) used by the provider. Compromised dependencies may introduce vulnerabilities during build or runtime.
  - Impact: The provider binary may incorporate malicious code, jeopardizing the security of all environments where it is deployed.
  - Affected Component: The build process and dependency management (go.mod and go.sum).
  - Current Mitigations: Specific versions of dependencies are declared in go.mod.
  - Missing Mitigations: Automated dependency scanning, use of reproducible builds, and integrity checks (code signing or checksum verification) for dependencies.
  - Risk Severity: High

- **Threat: CI/CD Pipeline Misconfiguration**
  - Description: Insecure configuration of GitHub Actions workflows (ci.yaml, lint.yaml, release.yaml) may allow unauthorized modifications or the injection of malicious build steps.
  - Impact: The provider binary produced by the build process could be tampered with, resulting in a malicious release.
  - Affected Component: GitHub workflows and CI configuration files as part of the build system.
  - Current Mitigations: Utilization of official action versions with standard permissions.
  - Missing Mitigations: Granular permission controls, secrets management enhancements, and regular audits of CI/CD configurations.
  - Risk Severity: High

- **Threat: Insufficient Isolation of Local Build Environment**
  - Description: The build scripts do not enforce robust isolation. A developer’s local machine or CI environment that is compromised could affect the build output.
  - Impact: Malicious modification of the provider binary during the build step leading to a compromised artifact.
  - Affected Component: Local build scripts (Makefile) and build process execution.
  - Current Mitigations: None explicitly beyond standard build instructions.
  - Missing Mitigations: Utilization of containerized or isolated CI environments to minimize risk from locally available threats.
  - Risk Severity: Medium

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

## Questions
- How are credentials managed and rotated over time for the Chronicle APIs accessed by the provider?
- Are additional security controls implemented on the Chronicle API side that complement the provider’s input validations?
- Is the CI/CD pipeline audited for misconfigurations or unauthorized changes on a regular basis?
- Does the release process incorporate artifact signing or integrity verification before distribution to users?
- What monitoring or automated checks are in place to detect potential exploitation of misconfigured custom endpoints?

## Assumptions
- The end user’s deployment environment (local machine running Terraform) is considered trusted.
- The Chronicle APIs have their own robust authentication and authorization mechanisms that complement provider-side validation.
- The provided schema validations (e.g., for AWS keys, UUIDs, URL formats) are assumed to catch the majority of malformed inputs.
- The CI/CD system (GitHub Actions) is assumed to employ standard security practices even though additional supply chain measures (like artifact signing) are not implemented.
- Network-level security (e.g., TLS encryption) is assumed to be managed by the underlying HTTP clients and external infrastructure.
- The risk from general threats such as network-level MITM attacks or log monitoring is considered out of scope for this threat model focused on application-specific risks.

Notes:
- General infrastructure threats (audit logging, system monitoring, and SSDLC practices) are out of scope here as the focus is on threats introduced by the provider’s application, deployment, and build processes.
- Some threats rely on assumptions about the user’s configuration and operational environment; users are encouraged to adopt additional security practices as needed.
