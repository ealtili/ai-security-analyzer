## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

1. I assume the provider communicates with Chronicle API endpoints using HTTPS, which is confirmed in the code where the endpoints are constructed with "https://" prefixes.

2. I assume the provider is intended to be used with Terraform's remote state capabilities rather than local state files, though this isn't enforced.

3. I assume authentication to Chronicle APIs is handled securely with proper token management, which is confirmed in the client implementation.

4. How are expired or revoked credentials handled by the provider? Is there graceful error handling and clear messages to users?

5. Does the provider implement any rate limiting or backoff strategies to prevent API abuse? The code shows rate limiting implementation with a default of 1 request per second.

6. What testing is performed specifically for security aspects of the provider?

7. Is there any telemetry or logging from the provider that could contain sensitive information?

8. How are updates and security patches to the provider communicated to users?

9. Are there any specific requirements or recommendations for securing access to the various third-party services that can be configured as feeds?
