# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

1. Authentication Methods: This threat model assumes that Chronicle APIs use either credential files or access tokens for authentication, as indicated in the provider's configuration options.

2. Deployment Model: Chronicle is assumed to be a SaaS offering that integrates with various data sources but is not self-hosted by the user organization.

3. Access Control: It's assumed that Chronicle's RBAC implementation is the primary means of controlling user access to the platform.

4. Data Sensitivity: This model assumes that data ingested from various sources may contain sensitive information requiring protection.

5. Additional Security Features: Are there any additional Chronicle security features not exposed through the Terraform provider that could mitigate some of the threats identified?

6. Encryption: What encryption capabilities does Chronicle provide for data at rest and in transit? How are these configured through the provider?

7. Compliance Requirements: Are there specific compliance frameworks that Chronicle implementations typically need to adhere to, which would impact the threat model?

8. Integration Security: How does Chronicle validate the security of connections to third-party data sources beyond the authentication credentials provided?

9. Rate Limiting Implementation: The code shows rate limiting implementations, but are these limits configurable and aligned with Chronicle API quotas?

10. Terraform Provider Version Update Process: How are users notified of security-related updates to the provider, and what is the recommended update process?
