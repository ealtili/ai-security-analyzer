# Attack Surface Analysis for "terraform-provider-chronicle"

## Attack Surface Identification

Below are the primary digital components and entry points for the “terraform-provider-chronicle” project:

1. Terraform Provider Code:
   - Written in Go, communicates with Chronicle APIs.
   - Houses logic for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources (feeds, rules, RBAC subjects, etc.) via HTTP requests.

2. Chronicle API Endpoints:
   - Various endpoints (e.g., Feed Management, Rules, RBAC) used to manage Chronicle resources.
   - Region-specific domain names (e.g., “europe-backstory.googleapis.com”) configured in code, potentially overridden by “custom endpoints” in provider configuration.

3. Authentication Mechanisms:
   - Environment-based: Uses environment variables for base64-encoded credentials (e.g., CHRONICLE_BACKSTORY_CREDENTIALS).
   - Direct token-based: Access tokens can be placed in local files or environment variables.
   - Local file paths: The provider also supports local credential files for Chronicle.

4. Debugging Interfaces (Optional):
   - A local Delve debugger may listen on port 2345 using the “debug.sh” script.

5. GitHub Repository and CI/CD Infrastructure:
   - GitHub Actions workflows (e.g., “ci.yaml”, “lint.yaml”, “release.yaml”) build and test the provider.
   - goreleaser configuration to package and publish provider binaries.

6. User-Supplied Input (Terraform Configuration):
   - All Terraform files that use this provider (e.g., .tf scripts).
   - Potential custom endpoints, log types, and resource attributes (e.g., S3 URIs, Okta hostnames) can be manipulated by users.

Potential Vulnerabilities or Insecure Configurations:
- Storing secrets in plaintext (environment or .tf files).
- Insecure custom endpoints leading to SSRF or Man-in-the-Middle (if TLS not enforced).
- Logging of credentials or tokens.
- Insufficient validation or sanitation of user-supplied data (e.g., malicious URIs for debugging or feed endpoints).

Reference Implementation Details:
- Provider code is found in “chronicle/*.go” and uses “client/*.go” to interact with Chronicle.
- Examples of usage and potential user entry points are in “examples/”.

## Threat Enumeration

Below is a STRIDE-based overview of potential threats:

1. Spoofing
   • If a malicious actor replaces Chronicle endpoints via “custom_endpoint” configuration, the provider might send credentials or data to an attacker-controlled server.
   • Compromised environment variables could lead to impersonation attacks if tokens or credentials are stolen.

2. Tampering
   • Malicious PRs in GitHub could alter lint or build scripts, injecting backdoors.
   • Attackers intercepting traffic (if TLS or certificate checks are disabled in custom endpoints) might modify in-flight requests to Chronicle.

3. Repudiation
   • Incomplete logging around Terraform actions could make it difficult to audit resource changes or attribute them to specific users.
   • Lack of robust traces in GitHub Actions may hamper accountability for changes to production binaries.

4. Information Disclosure
   • Debug logs or error messages might expose partial credentials or tokens if not sanitized.
   • Storing credentials in environment variables or .tf files can lead to credential leakage in version control or build logs.

5. Denial of Service
   • Excessive resource creation calls could trigger request rate throttling or account suspension.
   • Repeated invalid credentials could saturate the Chronicle APIs or local debugging ports.

6. Elevation of Privilege
   • Misconfigured or overly broad credentials (for S3 or Chronicle) might allow a user with minimal Terraform local privileges to manage high-privilege Chronicle resources.
   • The provider or test harness might inadvertently grant more roles (via “chronicle_rbac_subject”) than intended, allowing broader access.

## Impact Assessment

Below is a high-level analysis of each threat’s confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact:

• Malicious Custom Endpoint (Spoofing, Tampering)
  - Confidentiality: High (leak of credentials and resource data)
  - Integrity: High (attacker can hijack or alter feeds/rules)
  - Availability: Medium (could direct calls to a dead endpoint, causing errors)

• Credential Leakage in Logs or Repos (Information Disclosure)
  - Confidentiality: High (exposes sensitive tokens)
  - Integrity: Low directly, but attacker with stolen tokens might cause further tampering
  - Availability: N/A (no immediate downtime, but severe security risk)

• Overly Broad Permissions via Terraform RBAC (Elevation of Privilege)
  - Confidentiality: Medium (accidental or malicious expansion of roles)
  - Integrity: High (expanded roles let attacker modify resources or exfil data)
  - Availability: Medium (malicious changes in rules or feeds may disrupt logging pipeline)

• Supply Chain Attacks on GitHub Workflows (Tampering)
  - Confidentiality: Medium (access to build secrets)
  - Integrity: High (malicious code could be introduced in provider)
  - Availability: Low (mainly code integrity risk, less immediate effect on availability)

• Denial of Service from Resource Misuse (DoS)
  - Confidentiality: Low
  - Integrity: Low
  - Availability: Medium (excess usage might be blocked, halting legitimate requests)

Critical Vulnerabilities:
- Exposed or unencrypted credentials (environment variables, logs).
- Ability to override trusted endpoints with attacker-controlled hostnames.
- Potential for malicious code injection in CI or local build steps.

## Threat Ranking

High Priority Threats:
1. Malicious or misconfigured custom endpoints leading to credential interception (Spoofing, Tampering).
2. Exposed tokens or environment variables in logs or code repositories (Information Disclosure).
3. Overly broad or incorrectly assigned RBAC roles (Elevation of Privilege).

Medium Priority Threats:
1. Supply chain attacks on the GitHub repository (Tampering).
2. Lack of adequate logging or auditing for .tf changes (Repudiation).
3. Excessive resource creation or malicious .tf configurations causing DoS scenarios.

Low Priority Threats:
1. Minor logging issues or fallback debug messages.
2. Local development debug port (2345) less likely to be exploited if in secure environment.

## Mitigation Recommendations

1. Protect Credentials and Endpoints
   - Enforce secure methods for storing secrets (e.g., Vault or HashiCorp environment approach) instead of embedding credentials in .tf or environment variables.
   - Validate “custom_endpoint” strings to ensure they use HTTPS and have valid certificates. Provide in-code checks or warn the user if a non-HTTPS endpoint is specified.

2. Sanitize Logs and Errors
   - Ensure no tokens or secret fields appear in provider logs.
   - Mask sensitive data in debug output (even if “TF_LOG=DEBUG” is set).

3. Strengthen RBAC Configuration
   - Validate minimal necessary roles: remove or reduce privileges on “chronicle_rbac_subject” resources by default.
   - Provide usage guidelines on restricting role assignments so developers do not inadvertently escalate privileges.

4. Secure Supply Chain
   - Require PR approvals and branch protection for merges in GitHub.
   - Maintain updated dependencies and run vulnerability scans (dependabot or similar).
   - Use signed releases (via Goreleaser) and verify checksums in CI.

5. Harden Developer Debugging
   - Document that port 2345 is for local debug only and should not be publicly exposed.
   - For environments with restricted network policies, ensure the debug port is bound to “localhost.”

6. Rate Limiting and Request Governance
   - The existing retry logic and rate-limiter from “ClientRateLimiters” is good, but continue to monitor for potential DoS.
   - Add policies to detect suspicious usage patterns or repeated fail attempts to connect with invalid credentials.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

1. Have environment variables or local file-based credentials been validated not to appear in debug logs?
   - Assumption: They are partially masked, but must confirm through code analysis.

2. Does the project enforce TLS verification for all endpoints, including custom endpoints?
   - Assumption: The user can supply HTTPS endpoints, but the code does not appear to strictly forbid HTTP. Clarification needed.

3. Are there access controls or restricted scopes for Chronicle tokens?
   - Assumption: Users can limit permissions via GCP-based IAM or Chronicle’s role assignment. Confirm recommended practice in docs.

4. Are the GitHub Actions in “ci.yaml”, “lint.yaml”, “release.yaml” fully locked down (e.g., no untrusted runner tokens)?
   - Assumption: Standard GitHub best practices for restricting secret usage are in place.

5. Does the Terraform plugin handle large logs or environment variable content safely (e.g., large base64 strings)?
   - Assumption: The code attempts to parse them in memory but does not appear to store them in plain text logs.

These recommendations and analyses focus solely on software and configuration attack surfaces. Physical and social engineering vectors are out of scope for this threat model.
