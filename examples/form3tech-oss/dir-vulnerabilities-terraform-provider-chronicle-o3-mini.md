Below is a list of three real–world vulnerabilities discovered during our review of the Chronicle provider’s source code. These issues represent ways in which an external attacker (or a malicious insider who can control configuration) could trigger unintended behaviors in a publicly available instance of the application.

---

- **Vulnerability Name:** Exposed Debug Port (Debug Mode Enabled)
  - **Description:**
    The provider’s main binary supports a “debug” flag that, when enabled (for example via the “-debug” command–line argument), instructs the provider to launch with full debugger support by running a headless Delve debugger on port 2345. No restrictions are applied to the network interface or binding address. If—for example during troubleshooting or by misconfiguration—this debug mode is enabled in a production (or otherwise internet–accessible) environment, an attacker able to reach the provider’s network port could connect to the debugging interface and interact with the running process.
    - An attacker simply needs to supply the debug flag when starting Terraform (or run the provided “debug.sh” script) so that the provider listens on port 2345. Once the debugger is active, the attacker can connect (for example, with netcat or telnet) and send debugger commands.
  - **Impact:**
    An attacker who gains debugger access can inspect memory, change application state, and even execute arbitrary code within the provider’s process. This may result in disclosure of secrets (credentials, tokens) and lead to full system compromise.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The debug mode is off by default.
    - The README explains how to attach a debugger for troubleshooting purposes.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no restriction on the network interface (the debug server may bind to all interfaces rather than just localhost).
    - No runtime check exists to disable or restrict debug mode in production deployments.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The provider is launched with the “-debug” flag (or via the “debug.sh” script).
    - The debugging port (2345) is accessible over the network (for example, due to lack of proper firewall or binding to 0.0.0.0).
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In **main.go**, the debug flag is defined and parsed:
      - `flag.BoolVar(&debug, "debug", false, "set to true to run the provider with support for debuggers like delve")`
    - When debug is true, the plugin is served with debugger support (via `plugin.Serve(&plugin.ServeOpts{ Debug: debug, ProviderFunc: chronicle.Provider })`).
    - The provided **debug.sh** script then calls Delve with `--headless --listen=:2345`—with no restriction on binding to 127.0.0.1.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Start the provider with the debug flag enabled (for example: `./terraform-provider-chronicle -debug` or via `./debug.sh`).
    2. From an external host (or from the same machine, simulating an attacker able to reach the service), try to connect to port 2345 (e.g. using `nc [target-IP] 2345`).
    3. If you receive confirmation of a Delve debugger prompt or any debugger–specific output, the vulnerability is confirmed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Custom Endpoint SSRF
  - **Description:**
    The provider accepts a variety of custom endpoint settings (for example, “alert_custom_endpoint”, “artifact_custom_endpoint”, “alias_custom_endpoint”, etc.) in its configuration. These fields are validated only by checking that the input is a syntactically valid URL (using Go’s `url.ParseRequestURI`) but are not subjected to any additional filtering or allowlisting against known Chronicle domains. An attacker who can control the provider configuration (for instance via a malicious Terraform configuration file in a multi–tenant environment) can supply a custom endpoint URL directing API calls to an attacker–controlled server or to an internal (non–public) service.
    - For example, setting “alert_custom_endpoint” to “http://attacker.internal/steal” would cause all alerting–related API calls to be redirected.
  - **Impact:**
    This Server–Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability may allow an attacker to:
    - Force the provider to make requests to arbitrary internal endpoints, potentially accessing sensitive internal resources.
    - Exfiltrate data (including credentials) or trigger unwanted side effects on internal systems.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The custom endpoint settings are run through a basic URL parser (via the `validateCustomEndpoint` function), which ensures that only syntactically valid URLs are accepted.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No allowlisting or domain–based filtering is applied to ensure that custom endpoints belong only to trusted Chronicle domains.
    - No network egress filtering is performed in the provider code itself.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacking party must be able to supply a malicious Terraform configuration that sets one or more custom endpoint values.
    - The provider is executed in an environment where those custom endpoint settings are used to build API request URLs.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In **provider.go**, the schema for each custom endpoint (e.g. “alert_custom_endpoint”) is defined with:
      - `ValidateDiagFunc: validateCustomEndpoint`
    - The function `validateCustomEndpoint` simply calls `url.ParseRequestURI(u)` to verify URL syntax.
    - When configuring the client (in `providerConfigure`), the code checks for custom endpoints and calls methods such as `client.WithAlertBasePath(endpoint)`. No additional checks (like allowlisting or IP range checks) are employed.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a Terraform configuration that sets one of the custom endpoint values to a URL under your control (for instance, “http://attacker.example.com/foobar”).
    2. Run a Terraform operation (such as a “terraform plan” or “apply”) that causes the provider to make an API call using that custom endpoint.
    3. On your controlled server, verify that you have received the request, confirming that the provider used the supplied URL and that SSRF is possible.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive Data Exposure in Terraform State
  - **Description:**
    Multiple resource implementations (such as those for Amazon S3 and Amazon SQS feeds) retrieve and flatten authentication configuration values (including secret keys and access tokens) into the Terraform resource state via their “read” operations. Although the schema marks these fields as “Sensitive” (so they are hidden from normal CLI output), the raw secret values are nonetheless stored in plaintext inside the Terraform state file. If that state file is not adequately protected, an attacker who can access it could retrieve sensitive credentials.
    - For example, the `flattenDetailsFromReadOperation` function in the S3 feed resource returns a map that includes the “secret_access_key” without filtering.
  - **Impact:**
    An attacker with access to the Terraform state (through misconfigured state storage, local file system compromise, or other means) could extract cloud–provider credentials and use them to compromise the associated cloud resources.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The provider marks sensitive input fields as `Sensitive: true` in the schema, which prevents them from being displayed in CLI output.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - The provider continues to include sensitive credentials in the state file in plaintext.
    - No additional mechanisms are implemented to prevent these secrets from being stored (or to hash or redacted them) in the state.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must gain access to the Terraform state file (either stored locally or remotely in an insecure backend).
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In **resource_feed_amazon_s3.go**, the function `flattenDetailsFromReadOperation` rebuilds a details map that includes the “secret_access_key” pulled from the original configuration.
    - Similar patterns are observed in other feed resource implementations.
    - Although Terraform marks such fields as sensitive to avoid CLI display, the actual state is managed and stored in plaintext.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Provision a resource (e.g. an Amazon S3 feed) using known fake secret credentials.
    2. After resource creation, inspect the Terraform state file (or use “terraform state pull”) to view the stored resource attributes.
    3. Verify that the sensitive credentials (for instance, the “secret_access_key”) appear in the state file in plaintext.

Each of these vulnerabilities represents a real risk if the provider is deployed in an environment where an attacker “from the outside” can influence configuration or network access. It is recommended that remediation measures be applied—ensuring debug interfaces are bound only to loopback addresses and that custom endpoint values are strictly validated—and that state files are stored in a secure, encrypted backend.
