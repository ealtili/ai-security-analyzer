## Key Additions from New Files

### 1. Expanded Cloud Credential Exposure (New Sub-Goal 2.3)
- **Attack Paths**:
  - Extract AWS S3/SQS credentials from authentication blocks
  - Capture Azure Blobstore shared_key
  - Obtain GCS bucket credentials through Terraform state
- **Impact**: Direct access to cloud storage containing security logs

### 2. SaaS Integration Compromise (New Sub-Goal 2.4)
- **Attack Paths**:
  - Harvest Okta authentication tokens from multiple feed types
  - Extract Proofpoint SIEM user/secret combinations
  - Capture Office 365 client_secret with tenant access
- **Impact**: Full API access to integrated security systems

### 3. Log Ingestion Manipulation (New Sub-Goal 5)
- **Attack Paths**:
  - Redirect S3/SQS/Azure/GCS log sources to attacker-controlled storage
  - Poison Thinkst Canary feeds with false alerts
  - Modify Office 365 content_type to bypass parsing
- **Impact**: Compromise security monitoring integrity

## Updated Node Attributes

| Attack Step | Likelihood | Impact | Effort | Skill Level | Detection Difficulty |
|-------------|------------|--------|--------|-------------|-----------------------|
| 2.3 Cloud secrets | High | Critical | Low | Low | Medium |
| 2.4 SaaS tokens | High | High | Low | Low | Medium |
| 5.1 Log redirection | Medium | High | Medium | Intermediate | High |
| 5.2 Feed poisoning | Medium | Critical | High | Advanced | Low |

## Mitigation Enhancements

1. **Credential Protection**:
   - Implement sealed secrets pattern for cloud credentials
   - Automate credential rotation after Terraform applies
   - Add provider-level validation for credential formats

2. **Feed Security**:
   - Enforce DNS-based allowlisting for SaaS endpoints
   - Implement checksum verification for log source configurations
   - Add anomaly detection for feed configuration changes

3. **RBAC Hardening**:
   - Require MFA for subject role modifications
   - Implement time-bound privileges for IDP group assignments
   - Add change approval workflows for role escalations

## Questions & Assumptions

1. Are cloud storage credentials automatically rotated after Terraform deployments?
2. Is there validation for Office 365 content_type vs actual log format?
3. Do Thinkst Canary feeds have integrity verification mechanisms?

**Default Assumptions**
- Cloud credentials might grant write access to log storage locations
- Office 365 content_type modifications could bypass parsing logic
- Proofpoint SIEM secrets provide full API access to threat data
- Terraform state files might be stored without encryption-at-rest
