# Attack Surface Analysis for terraform-provider-chronicle

This attack surface analysis focuses on the potential security risks introduced by the `terraform-provider-chronicle` project. The analysis excludes general, common attack surfaces and emphasizes areas where the project contributes to vulnerabilities.

## Key Attack Surfaces

### 1. Improper Handling of Credentials in Environment Variables

- **Description**: The provider allows credentials to be specified via environment variables. If not handled securely, these credentials can be exposed to unauthorized users or processes on the system.
- **Contribution by terraform-provider-chronicle**: The provider's configuration relies on environment variables to receive sensitive credentials for various APIs (e.g., `CHRONICLE_BACKSTORY_CREDENTIALS`, `CHRONICLE_BIGQUERY_CREDENTIALS`).
- **Example**:
  - In `provider.go`, the provider schema includes fields like:
    ```go
    Schema: map[string]*schema.Schema{
      "bigqueryapi_credentials": {
        Type:     schema.TypeString,
        Optional: true,
        Description: `BigQuery API credential. Local file path or content.
        It may be replaced by CHRONICLE_BIGQUERY_CREDENTIALS environment variable, which expects base64 encoded credential.`,
      },
      // ... other credentials
    },
    ```
  - If environment variables are not secured properly, they can be read by other users or processes.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to the Chronicle APIs using exposed credentials, leading to potential data breaches or unauthorized actions.
- **Risk Severity**: **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Encourage the use of secure credential storage solutions (e.g., key management services or secrets managers).
  - Avoid relying solely on environment variables for sensitive data. Provide alternatives like secured configuration files with restricted permissions.
  - Update documentation to emphasize best practices for securing environment variables.

### 2. Hardcoded Sensitive Information in Code

- **Description**: Presence of hardcoded secrets, tokens, or keys within the codebase.
- **Contribution by terraform-provider-chronicle**: Test files and examples contain hardcoded credentials and secrets that could be mistakenly used or exposed.
- **Example**:
  - In test files and examples:
    ```go
    accessKeyID := "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    secretAccessKey := "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    tenantID := "50352502-a347-11ed-a8fc-0242ac120001"
    clientID := "50352701-a307-11ed-a8fc-0242ac120001"
    ```
  - These values, if real, could be exploited if exposed.
- **Impact**: Potential leakage of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access and exploitation.
- **Risk Severity**: **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Ensure all hardcoded credentials are dummy values and do not correspond to real accounts.
  - Use mocking or environment variables in tests to supply credentials securely.
  - Implement code scanning tools to detect and prevent hardcoded secrets from being committed to the repository.

### 3. Exposure of Sensitive Data through Logging

- **Description**: Sensitive information such as authentication tokens or secrets may be logged, leading to potential exposure.
- **Contribution by terraform-provider-chronicle**: The code contains logging statements that may inadvertently include sensitive data.
- **Example**:
  - In `errors_helper.go`:
    ```go
    return fmt.Errorf(
      fmt.Sprintf("Error when reading or editing %s: {{err}}", resource), err)
    ```
  - If `err` contains sensitive information, it may be logged or displayed.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized users accessing logs can obtain sensitive information, leading to security breaches.
- **Risk Severity**: **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Review and sanitize all logging statements to ensure no sensitive data is included.
  - Implement logging best practices, avoiding the inclusion of secrets or personal data in logs.
  - Use structured logging to control the granularity of logged data.

### 4. Insecure Custom Endpoints Configuration

- **Description**: Allowing users to specify custom endpoints can lead to potential redirection to malicious servers.
- **Contribution by terraform-provider-chronicle**: The provider allows the configuration of custom endpoints for various services without stringent validation.
- **Example**:
  - In `provider.go`, custom endpoints are accepted:
    ```go
    "events_custom_endpoint": {
      Type:     schema.TypeString,
      Optional: true,
      Description: `Custom URL to events endpoint.`,
    },
    // ... other custom endpoints
    ```
  - An attacker could manipulate the configuration to redirect API calls to a malicious server.
- **Impact**: Man-in-the-middle attacks, data exfiltration, and unauthorized access.
- **Risk Severity**: **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Implement strict validation on custom endpoints to ensure they match allowed patterns or domains.
  - Provide warnings or require additional confirmation when custom endpoints are used.
  - Document the risks associated with using custom endpoints and guide users on secure configurations.

### 5. Lack of Input Validation

- **Description**: Insufficient validation on user inputs can lead to injection attacks or unintended behavior.
- **Contribution by terraform-provider-chronicle**: The provider may accept and use user-provided data in configurations without proper validation.
- **Example**:
  - In resource definitions, user inputs like URIs or authentication credentials are accepted:
    ```go
    "s3_uri": {
      Type:     schema.TypeString,
      Required: true,
      Description: `The S3 URI to ingest.`,
    },
    ```
  - Malicious inputs could exploit vulnerabilities if not validated.
- **Impact**: Execution of unauthorized commands, data corruption, or security breaches.
- **Risk Severity**: **Medium**
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Implement thorough input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data.
  - Use validation functions to enforce expected formats and prevent malicious inputs.
  - Leverage Terraform's `ValidateDiagFunc` for schema fields to incorporate validation logic.

### 6. Third-Party Dependencies Risks

- **Description**: Relying on outdated or vulnerable third-party libraries can introduce security weaknesses.
- **Contribution by terraform-provider-chronicle**: The project imports several external packages that may have known vulnerabilities.
- **Example**:
  - Dependencies in `go.mod` or imported in the code may not be the latest secure versions.
- **Impact**: Exploitation of known vulnerabilities leading to denial of service or unauthorized access.
- **Risk Severity**: **Medium**
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Regularly audit and update third-party dependencies to the latest secure versions.
  - Use tools like `Dependabot` or `Go Modules` to manage and update dependencies automatically.
  - Monitor security advisories related to the dependencies used.

### 7. Potential Confusion Between Test and Production Environments

- **Description**: Test scripts or configurations may be accidentally used in production, causing unintended side effects.
- **Contribution by terraform-provider-chronicle**: Test scripts like `GNUmakefile` and example configurations may not be clearly distinguished from production code.
- **Example**:
  - `GNUmakefile` contains targets that could affect production:
    ```makefile
    install: lint build
    	@mkdir -p $(LOCAL_PLUGIN_DIR)
    	@cp $(PROJECT_NAME) $(LOCAL_PLUGIN_DIR)/
    	@echo "Install succeeded"
    ```
  - If executed inadvertently, it may install development versions over production plugins.
- **Impact**: Service disruption, deployment of untested code, or overwriting stable versions.
- **Risk Severity**: **Medium**
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Clearly label and document test scripts and ensure they are separated from production code.
  - Implement safeguards in scripts to check the environment before execution.
  - Encourage best practices where test and production configurations are managed separately.

### 8. Insufficient Validation of User-Provided Rules

- **Description**: Sending user-provided YARA rules directly to the API for verification and creation without proper validation can lead to security vulnerabilities.
- **Contribution by terraform-provider-chronicle**: The provider allows users to define custom YARA rules, which are then sent to the Chronicle API. If these rules are not properly validated, they can cause unintended behavior or exploitation of vulnerabilities in the API.
- **Example**:
  - In `rule.go`, the `VerifyYARARule` function sends the `ruleText` to the API:
    ```go
    func (cli *Client) VerifyYARARule(yaraRule string) (bool, error) {
    	url := fmt.Sprintf("%s:verifyRule", cli.RuleBasePath)
    	body := map[string]string{
    		"ruleText": yaraRule,
    	}
    	// ...
    	res, err := sendRequest(cli, cli.backstoryAPIClient, "POST", cli.userAgent, url, body)
    	// ...
    }
    ```
  - If an attacker crafts a malicious YARA rule, it might exploit the API's rule parsing logic.
- **Impact**: Potential denial of service, remote code execution, or other exploitation of vulnerabilities in the backend API.
- **Risk Severity**: **Medium**
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Implement client-side validation and sanitization of YARA rules before sending them to the API.
  - Limit the complexity and size of rules that can be submitted.
  - Monitor and handle API responses to detect and mitigate potential abuse.

### 9. Arbitrary File Read via Path Manipulation

- **Description**: The provider allows users to specify file paths or content for configurations. If not properly restricted, this can lead to arbitrary file reads from the filesystem.
- **Contribution by terraform-provider-chronicle**: The `pathOrContents` function attempts to read the contents of a given path if it exists. If an attacker can influence the value of the path, they might read sensitive files.
- **Example**:
  - In `util.go`, the `pathOrContents` function:
    ```go
    func pathOrContents(poc string) (string, bool, error) {
    	// ...
    	path := filepath.Clean(poc)
    	// ...
    	if _, err := os.Stat(path); err == nil {
    		contents, err := os.ReadFile(path)
    		if err != nil {
    			return string(contents), true, err
    		}
    		return string(contents), true, nil
    	}
    	// ...
    }
    ```
  - If `poc` (path or content) is influenced by user input, an attacker could supply paths to sensitive files.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the system, leading to information disclosure.
- **Risk Severity**: **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Restrict the paths that can be read to a safe set of directories.
  - Implement path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks.
  - Use least privilege principles when accessing the filesystem.
  - Document and enforce that the `poc` parameter should only be controlled by trusted sources.

## Conclusion

The `terraform-provider-chronicle` project introduces several attack surfaces that need to be addressed to enhance security. By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, developers and users can reduce the risk of exploitation and ensure secure integration with the Chronicle APIs. Continuous review and improvement of the codebase, along with adherence to security best practices, are essential to maintain a robust security posture.
