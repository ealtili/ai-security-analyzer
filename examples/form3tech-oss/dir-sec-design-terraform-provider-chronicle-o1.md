# BUSINESS POSTURE
The primary business goal of this project is to provide a Terraform provider for Chronicle, enabling automated provisioning and management of Chronicle resources (feeds, rules, reference lists, and RBAC subjects). This streamlines the integration between Terraform-based infrastructure-as-code workflows and Chronicle's security analytics service. The project aims to reduce manual efforts for security engineers and DevOps teams, allowing organizations to swiftly deploy and manage Chronicle resources in a consistent, repeatable way.

Business priorities and goals include:
1. Simplify management of Chronicle feeds, rules, and configurations via Terraform.
2. Provide a stable integration point for automated pipelines, enabling version control and collaborative workflows.
3. Reduce complexity and manual overhead when configuring Chronicle environments at scale.
4. Ensure reliability and auditability of security configurations, supporting compliance requirements.

Most important business risks to address:
1. Misconfiguration leading to disruption of Chronicle ingest or alerts, impacting security visibility.
2. Insecure handling of credentials or feed configuration, potentially exposing sensitive data.
3. Unavailability or instability of the Terraform provider, delaying business operations and security investigations.
4. Reputational risk if the provider fails to meet enterprise-grade security and reliability requirements.

# SECURITY POSTURE
Existing security controls:
security control: Authentication flows are handled via built-in environment variables or by reading local credential files. This is implemented in the provider's code (provider.go, client.go) where the code loads credentials from environment variables (CHRONICLE_*) or from local paths.
security control: Input validation checks for AWS access keys, GCS URIs, and general resource properties (validation.go).
security control: Basic rate limiting for each operation to prevent flooding Chronicle APIs (see client/endpoints.go).
security control: Terraform state retains a restricted set of credentials or uses ephemeral environment variables.

Accepted risks:
accepted risk: Reliance on Terraform state security. If state files are not protected, credentials could be exposed.
accepted risk: Storing base64-encoded credentials in environment variables. If those environment variables are leaked, Chronicle secrets could be compromised.

Recommended security controls (high priority):
1. security control: Consider using a dedicated secrets manager for Chronicle secrets rather than environment variables.
2. security control: Enforce mandatory encryption at rest for any local or remote Terraform state (for example, storing state in an encrypted S3 bucket or Terraform Cloud with encryption).
3. security control: Add code scanning tools (SAST and dependency checks) to the CI pipeline to detect vulnerable libraries and insecure coding patterns.
4. security control: Enforce continuous vulnerability checks on dependencies.
5. security control: Provide thorough documentation on rotating credentials, ensuring short-lived tokens where possible.

Important security requirements:
1. Authentication: All Chronicle API calls must be authenticated using GCP or Chronicle-provided credentials/tokens. Rotate credentials regularly.
2. Authorization: Limit the privileges of GCP credentials used by the provider to only necessary Chronicle API scopes.
3. Input validation: Continue verifying user inputs for resource definitions (feed URIs, region constraints, etc.) to prevent misconfigurations.
4. Cryptography: TLS must be enforced when communicating between the Terraform client and Chronicle APIs. Any stored credentials should be encrypted (for instance, in state or ephemeral environment variables).

## BUILD
Below is an example simplified build pipeline from source to artifact:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Developer --> CommitCode --> GitHubActions
    GitHubActions --> LintTest(SAST / Lint / Unit Tests)
    LintTest --> BuildBinary
    BuildBinary --> ReleaseArtifact
```
1. Developer makes changes locally.
2. Code is pushed to GitHub.
3. GitHub Actions runs lint, format checks, and unit tests (potentially including SAST scanners).
4. If successful, the plugin is built.
5. Final artifacts are uploaded as a release.

# RISK ASSESSMENT
Critical business processes to protect:
1. Automated provisioning and update of Chronicle resources (feeds, rules, roles).
2. Maintenance and audit of security analytics pipeline.

Data to protect and their sensitivity:
1. Chronicle credentials (environment variables, potential in Terraform state). High sensitivity.
2. Configuration data for feeds and rules (could reveal internal structure or logging strategies). Medium to high sensitivity.
3. Terraform state files with partial secrets or references to environment data. Medium to high sensitivity.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
1. Questions:
   - Who is responsible for rotation and management of Chronicle credentials (platform team, security team, or DevOps)?
   - Is there a dedicated secrets manager or do we rely solely on environment variables?
   - Is encryption enforced by default in Terraform state (for instance, Terraform Cloud with encryption at rest)?
   - Do we require multi-factor or short-lived tokens for API calls?

2. Assumptions:
   - Chronicle credentials are managed securely outside of version control.
   - The organization is comfortable with environment variables as a short-term method of injecting credentials, provided the environment is locked down.
   - The provided Terraform plugin code is built and distributed through a secure CI environment, with code scanning and artifact validation.
   - TLS is always enforced when communicating between the provider and Chronicle endpoints.
