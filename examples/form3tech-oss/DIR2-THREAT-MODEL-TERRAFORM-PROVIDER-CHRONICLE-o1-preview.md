# Threat Model for Terraform Provider Chronicle

## Threats

### 1. Exposure of Sensitive Data in State Files, Logs, and Error Messages

- **Description**: The provider may store or log sensitive data such as authentication tokens, secret keys, and client secrets in the Terraform state file, output logs, or error messages. Attackers gaining access to these files or logs could obtain these sensitive credentials. For example, in `client/transport.go`, the `sendRequest` function logs errors, which may include sensitive data.

- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to cloud resources or third-party services using compromised credentials, leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, and potential escalation of privileges.

- **Affected Component**:
  - Resource implementations, particularly functions like `flattenDetailsFromReadOperation` in various resource files (e.g., `resource_feed_thinkst_canary.go`, `resource_feed_microsoft_office_365_management_activity.go`), which handle sensitive data.
  - Logging statements in `client/transport.go`, especially in the `sendRequest` function where errors are logged without sanitization.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - Some sensitive fields are marked as `Sensitive` in the schema, which instructs Terraform to handle them appropriately.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Ensure all sensitive data is appropriately marked as `Sensitive` in the schema.
  - Review all resource implementations to verify that sensitive data is not inadvertently stored in the state file, output logs, or error messages.
  - Avoid setting sensitive data from API responses into the resource data unless necessary.
  - Implement error handling that sanitizes or redacts sensitive data from error messages before logging.
  - Use appropriate logging levels and avoid logging sensitive information in debug logs.

- **Risk Severity**: **High**

### 2. Improper Handling of Credentials in Configuration Files

- **Description**: The provider allows specifying credentials via configuration files or environment variables. Users may inadvertently expose sensitive credentials if they check in configuration files containing the credentials to version control systems.

- **Impact**: Exposure of credentials leading to unauthorized access to services and data breaches.

- **Affected Component**: Provider configuration schema (e.g., `bigqueryapi_credentials`, `backstoryapi_credentials` in `provider.go`).

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - The provider allows specifying credentials via environment variables, which can help keep credentials out of configuration files.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Update documentation to emphasize best practices for managing credentials securely.
  - Encourage using environment variables or secret management tools instead of hardcoding credentials in configuration files.
  - Provide examples and guidelines on using secure methods for credential management.

- **Risk Severity**: **Medium**

### 3. Potential for Insecure Defaults

- **Description**: The provider may have default configurations or settings that are not secure, potentially leading to unintended exposure of data or services.

- **Impact**: Security vulnerabilities due to misconfigurations, leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.

- **Affected Component**: Provider's default configurations and resource definitions.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - Not specified in the project files.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Review default configurations to ensure they are secure.
  - Set secure defaults for all configurations and document the implications of changing them.
  - Provide guidance on secure configuration practices in the documentation.

- **Risk Severity**: **Medium**

### 4. Dependency on Third-Party Libraries with Potential Vulnerabilities

- **Description**: The provider depends on third-party libraries or tools that may contain vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by attackers.

- **Impact**: Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in dependencies can lead to compromise of the provider or the infrastructure it manages.

- **Affected Component**: External dependencies specified in `go.mod` and used in the codebase.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - Not specified in the project files.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Regularly update dependencies to the latest secure versions.
  - Use tools to monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk).
  - Implement a process for vulnerability management in dependencies.
  - Perform periodic security assessments of third-party libraries.

- **Risk Severity**: **Medium**
