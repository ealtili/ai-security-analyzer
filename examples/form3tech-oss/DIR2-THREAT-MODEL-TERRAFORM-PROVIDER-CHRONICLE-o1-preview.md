# Threat Model for Terraform Provider Chronicle

## Threat: Exposure of Sensitive Credentials in Error Messages

### Description

When invalid credentials are supplied to the `terraform-provider-chronicle` application, the error handling mechanisms may include the raw contents of these credentials in the error messages. Specifically, the functions `GetCredentials` in `client/client.go` and `validateCredentials` in `chronicle/validation.go` incorporate variables containing sensitive data directly into the error outputs. An attacker with access to logs or error outputs could exploit this vulnerability to retrieve sensitive credentials.

### Impact

Exposure of sensitive credentials can lead to unauthorized access to the Chronicle API. An attacker could use these credentials to access, modify, or delete resources within the Chronicle environment, leading to potential data breaches and loss of integrity and confidentiality.

### Affected Component

- `GetCredentials` function in `client/client.go`
- `validateCredentials` function in `chronicle/validation.go`

### Risk Severity

**High**

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Sanitize Error Messages**: Modify the error handling code to ensure that sensitive data is not included in error messages. Avoid incorporating raw credential contents into errors.
- **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data**: Ensure that logs do not contain any sensitive information such as credentials or access tokens.
- **Input Validation**: Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent sensitive data from being inadvertently exposed.
- **Code Audit**: Perform regular code reviews and security audits to identify and remediate instances where sensitive data may be exposed.
- **Use Secure Libraries**: Utilize secure libraries and frameworks that handle credential management and error reporting securely.

## Threat: Exposure of Sensitive Credentials in Terraform State Files

### Description

The `terraform-provider-chronicle` may store sensitive credentials, such as access keys and secrets, in plaintext within the Terraform state files. Since Terraform state files by default store all resource attributes, including any sensitive data provided, an attacker with access to these state files could retrieve sensitive credentials and gain unauthorized access to the Chronicle API or other integrated services.

### Impact

Exposure of sensitive credentials through state files can lead to unauthorized access to critical systems, data breaches, and compromise of the Chronicle environment. Attackers could exploit these credentials to perform malicious operations, leading to loss of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### Affected Component

- **Resource Definitions**: Handling sensitive credentials in authentication configurations across various feed resources:
  - `feed_amazon_s3` (`feed_amazon_s3.go`)
  - `feed_amazon_sqs` (`feed_amazon_sqs.go`)
  - `feed_azure_blobstore` (`feed_azure_blobstore.go`)
  - `feed_google_cloud_storage_bucket` (`feed_google_cloud_storage_bucket.go`)
  - `feed_microsoft_office_365_management_activity` (`feed_microsoft_office_365_management_activity.go`)
  - `feed_okta_system_log` (`feed_okta_system_log.go`)
  - `feed_okta_users` (`feed_okta_users.go`)
  - `feed_proofpoint_siem` (`feed_proofpoint_siem.go`)
  - `feed_qualys_vm` (`feed_qualys_vm.go`)
  - `feed_thinkst_canary` (`feed_thinkst_canary.go`)

### Risk Severity

**Critical**

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Mark Sensitive Attributes**: Update the Terraform provider code to mark all sensitive attributes (e.g., `access_key_id`, `secret_access_key`, `shared_key`, `client_secret`, `user`, `secret`, etc.) with `Sensitive: true` in the schema definitions. This prevents Terraform from storing these values in plaintext within state files.
- **Utilize `ConfigSchema`**: Implement the `ConfigSchema` in the provider to accept sensitive data during provider configuration without storing it in the state.
- **Use Environment Variables or Secret Management**: Encourage the use of environment variables or secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to supply sensitive information at runtime rather than hardcoding them in configuration files.
- **Secure State Storage**: Advise users to store state files securely by using remote backends with encryption at rest and proper access controls (e.g., Terraform Cloud, AWS S3 with encryption and tight IAM policies).
- **Documentation and Alerts**: Update the documentation to include warnings about the risks of storing sensitive data and provide best practices. Implement alerts or warnings in the provider when users attempt to include sensitive data in ways that could compromise security.
- **Code Reviews and Testing**: Conduct thorough code reviews and implement automated tests to ensure that sensitive attributes are correctly marked and handled throughout the provider codebase.

## Threat: Logging of Sensitive Data During Request Retries

### Description

The `sendRequest` function in `client/transport.go` includes a retry mechanism that logs errors when retries occur. The error messages logged (`log.Printf("[DEBUG] Retrying request after error: %v", err)`) may contain sensitive information if the error includes sensitive data returned from the server or included in request parameters. An attacker with access to application logs could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information.

### Impact

Logging sensitive data can lead to unauthorized disclosure of credentials or other sensitive information, potentially allowing attackers to compromise accounts or services. This can result in data breaches, unauthorized actions within the Chronicle environment, and a loss of trust and compliance violations.

### Affected Component

- `sendRequest` function in `client/transport.go`

### Risk Severity

**Medium**

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Avoid Logging Sensitive Errors**: Modify the logging mechanism to ensure that error messages do not include sensitive information. Use error wrapping and custom error types to control the level of detail in logs.
- **Use Log Levels Appropriately**: Adjust log levels to prevent sensitive information from being logged in debug or error logs. Sensitive data should never be logged, even in debug mode.
- **Implement Error Scrubbing**: Create utility functions to sanitize errors before logging, removing or masking any sensitive content.
- **Secure Log Storage**: Ensure that log files are stored securely with proper access controls and encryption to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Regular Auditing**: Perform regular audits of log files and logging configurations to ensure compliance with security policies and standards.
- **Developer Training**: Educate developers about the risks of logging sensitive data and enforce coding standards that prevent such practices.
