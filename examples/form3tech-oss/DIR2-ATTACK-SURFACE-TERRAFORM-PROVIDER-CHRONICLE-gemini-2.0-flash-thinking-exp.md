## Attack Surface Analysis for Application using Terraform Chronicle

This document outlines the attack surface introduced by the use of the `terraform-provider-chronicle`. It focuses on vulnerabilities specific to the provider and excludes general security considerations.

### Key Attack Surface List

- **Description:** Exposure of sensitive credentials used to authenticate with Chronicle and external services.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** The provider requires credentials (API keys, access tokens, secrets) for Chronicle and various third-party services (AWS, Azure, Okta, etc.) to manage resources. These credentials are often stored within the Terraform configuration or state files. The provider also allows specifying credentials as file paths, potentially exposing the file system.
  - **Example:** A developer accidentally commits a Terraform configuration file containing plaintext credentials for an AWS S3 bucket used as a Chronicle feed source to a public repository. Alternatively, a file path to a credentials file with overly permissive access is used in the Terraform configuration.
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Chronicle instance and potentially the connected third-party services. Attackers could ingest malicious data, modify configurations, or exfiltrate existing data.
  - **Risk Severity:** Critical
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Use Terraform Cloud or a similar remote backend:** Store the Terraform state file securely with access controls.
    - **Avoid storing credentials directly in Terraform configuration:** Utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to manage sensitive credentials.
    - **Implement proper access controls on the state file backend:** Restrict access to the state file to authorized personnel only.
    - **Regularly rotate credentials:** Enforce a policy for periodic rotation of API keys and secrets.
    - **Utilize provider features for credential management:** Explore if the provider offers mechanisms for more secure credential handling (though generally Terraform relies on external secret management).
    - **Secure the file system where the Terraform provider runs:** If using file paths for credentials, ensure appropriate file system permissions are in place to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Description:** Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks intercepting communication between the Terraform provider and Chronicle or external services.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** The provider communicates with the Chronicle API and potentially other third-party APIs over a network. If these connections are not properly secured, they are susceptible to MITM attacks. The ability to configure custom endpoints increases this risk if HTTPS is not enforced.
  - **Example:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the Terraform provider and the Chronicle API, potentially gaining access to API keys or sensitive configuration data being transmitted. An attacker could also intercept traffic to a misconfigured custom endpoint.
  - **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, including API keys and configuration details. Attackers could potentially impersonate the provider or the API.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Ensure HTTPS is used for all API communication:** Verify that the provider and the Chronicle API enforce secure connections (TLS/SSL).
    - **Implement network segmentation:** Isolate the environment where the Terraform provider runs to limit potential attacker access.
    - **Use trusted networks:** Avoid running Terraform operations on untrusted networks.
    - **Verify TLS certificates:** Ensure that the provider validates the TLS certificates of the endpoints it communicates with.
    - **Avoid using custom endpoints unless absolutely necessary:** If custom endpoints are required, ensure they are properly secured with HTTPS.

- **Description:** Misconfiguration of feed resources leading to unintended data ingestion or exposure.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** The provider allows users to configure various data feeds from external sources (e.g., Amazon S3, Amazon SQS, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage). Incorrectly configured feeds could ingest unintended data or expose sensitive information to Chronicle.
  - **Example:** A misconfigured Amazon S3 feed with overly permissive access rights allows ingestion of data from a publicly accessible bucket, potentially containing sensitive information. An Azure Blob Storage feed configured with an overly permissive SAS token could allow unauthorized data ingestion.
  - **Impact:** Ingestion of irrelevant or malicious data, potential exposure of sensitive data within Chronicle, and increased storage costs.
  - **Risk Severity:** Medium
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Apply the principle of least privilege when configuring feed access:** Grant only the necessary permissions to access data sources.
    - **Regularly review feed configurations:** Audit existing feed configurations to ensure they are still appropriate and secure.
    - **Implement input validation and sanitization within Chronicle:** While not a provider-level mitigation, ensure Chronicle has mechanisms to handle unexpected or malicious data.
    - **Monitor feed activity:** Track data ingestion patterns and volumes to detect anomalies.

- **Description:** Misconfiguration of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allowing unauthorized access to Chronicle resources.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** The `chronicle_rbac_subject` resource allows managing user and group permissions within Chronicle. Incorrectly assigned roles can grant excessive privileges.
  - **Example:** A Terraform configuration grants "Editor" role to a user who only needs "Viewer" access, potentially allowing them to modify critical rules or configurations.
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of Chronicle resources, potential data breaches, and disruption of security monitoring.
  - **Risk Severity:** Medium
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning roles:** Grant only the necessary permissions required for each user or group.
    - **Regularly review RBAC configurations:** Audit existing role assignments to ensure they are still appropriate.
    - **Implement a well-defined RBAC policy:** Establish clear guidelines for assigning roles and responsibilities within Chronicle.
    - **Utilize groups for managing permissions:** Assign roles to groups instead of individual users for easier management and consistency.

- **Description:** Exposure of sensitive information through debug logs or error messages.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** Enabling debug mode or encountering errors might lead to the logging of sensitive information, such as API requests containing credentials or configuration details.
  - **Example:** Debug logs from the Terraform provider inadvertently include the `secret_access_key` for an AWS SQS feed.
  - **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials or configuration details, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
  - **Risk Severity:** Medium
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Avoid enabling debug mode in production environments:** Only use debug mode for troubleshooting in development or testing environments.
    - **Implement secure logging practices:** Ensure logs are stored securely with appropriate access controls.
    - **Sanitize logs:** Filter out sensitive information from logs before storing them.
    - **Regularly review log configurations:** Ensure that logging levels are appropriate for the environment.

- **Description:** Storing sensitive authentication details in the Terraform state file.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** While best practices discourage direct credential storage, the state file might inadvertently contain sensitive information passed to the provider, especially if environment variables are not used correctly. This includes credentials for Chronicle APIs (BigQuery, Backstory, Ingestion, Forwarder) and feed sources (AWS, Azure, Office 365).
  - **Example:** Although not directly in the configuration, the resolved values in the state file for `backstoryapi_credentials` might contain the actual credential content if a file path was used. Similarly, the `shared_key` for an Azure Blob Storage feed or the `client_secret` for an Office 365 feed might be present in the state.
  - **Impact:** If the state file is compromised, attackers can retrieve sensitive credentials.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Utilize remote backends for state file storage with encryption:** Services like Terraform Cloud, AWS S3 with encryption, or Azure Storage with encryption provide secure storage for state files.
    - **Avoid using local state files in production:** Local state files are more vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    - **Regularly audit the state file content (if necessary):** Understand what information is being stored in the state file and take steps to minimize sensitive data exposure.

- **Description:** Exposure of AWS credentials for SQS feeds.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** The `chronicle_feed_amazon_sqs` resource requires AWS access keys and secret keys to access the SQS queue. These credentials, similar to the S3 feed, can be exposed if not handled securely. It also allows for separate S3 credentials, potentially leading to confusion and misconfiguration.
  - **Example:** A developer configures an SQS feed and stores the `sqs_access_key_id` and `sqs_secret_access_key` directly in the Terraform configuration file.
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the specified SQS queue, potentially allowing attackers to read messages, delete messages, or inject malicious messages. If separate S3 credentials are used and compromised, it could lead to unauthorized access to the associated S3 bucket.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Avoid storing AWS credentials directly in Terraform configuration:** Utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) for managing `sqs_access_key_id`, `sqs_secret_access_key`, and the optional S3 credentials.
    - **Apply the principle of least privilege to IAM roles:** Ensure the IAM user or role used by the provider has only the necessary permissions to access the SQS queue and the associated S3 bucket (if applicable).
    - **Regularly rotate AWS credentials:** Enforce a policy for periodic rotation of access keys.
    - **Securely manage and store the Terraform state file:** As the state file may contain the resolved values of these credentials.
    - **Carefully manage separate S3 credentials for SQS feeds:** If using separate S3 credentials, ensure they are necessary and follow the same security best practices as other AWS credentials.

- **Description:** Exposure of Azure Blob Storage credentials.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** The `chronicle_feed_azure_blobstore` resource requires either a shared key (`shared_key`) or a Shared Access Signature token (`sas_token`) to authenticate with Azure Blob Storage. These credentials, if exposed, grant access to the storage account.
  - **Example:** A developer hardcodes the `shared_key` for an Azure Blob Storage container directly into the Terraform configuration. Alternatively, a `sas_token` with overly broad permissions and a long expiry is used in the configuration.
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Azure Blob Storage account, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Attackers could access sensitive logs or inject malicious data into the storage.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Avoid storing Azure Blob Storage credentials directly in Terraform configuration:** Utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) for managing `shared_key` and `sas_token`.
    - **Use SAS tokens with the principle of least privilege:** When using SAS tokens, grant only the necessary permissions (read, list) and set an appropriate expiry time.
    - **Regularly rotate Azure Storage account keys:** If using shared keys, enforce a policy for periodic rotation.
    - **Securely manage and store the Terraform state file:** As the state file may contain the resolved values of these credentials.
    - **Consider using Azure Managed Identities:** If the Terraform provider runs within an Azure environment, explore using Managed Identities to avoid managing credentials directly.

- **Description:** Exposure of Microsoft Office 365 Management Activity API credentials.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** The `chronicle_feed_microsoft_office_365_management_activity` resource requires a `client_id` and `client_secret` for authentication with the Office 365 Management Activity API. These credentials, if compromised, allow access to audit logs and potentially sensitive information.
  - **Example:** A developer includes the `client_secret` in plaintext within the Terraform configuration file.
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Office 365 audit logs, potentially revealing sensitive user activity, security events, and other confidential information. Attackers could use this information for further attacks or compliance violations.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Avoid storing Office 365 credentials directly in Terraform configuration:** Utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) for managing `client_id` and `client_secret`.
    - **Register the application with the least privileged permissions:** Ensure the Azure AD application used for the integration has only the necessary API permissions.
    - **Regularly rotate the client secret:** Implement a policy for periodic rotation of the `client_secret` in Azure AD.
    - **Securely manage and store the Terraform state file:** As the state file may contain the resolved values of these credentials.

- **Description:** Exposure of Okta API token for System Log feed.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** The `chronicle_feed_okta_system_log` resource requires an Okta API token (`value` in the `authentication` block) for authenticating with the Okta API to retrieve system logs.
  - **Example:** A developer hardcodes the Okta API token within the Terraform configuration.
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Okta system logs, potentially revealing sensitive user activity, authentication attempts, and security events. Attackers could use this information for reconnaissance or further attacks.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Avoid storing the Okta API token directly in Terraform configuration:** Utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) for managing the token.
    - **Use the principle of least privilege for the API token:** Ensure the API token has only the necessary permissions to access system logs.
    - **Regularly rotate the Okta API token:** Implement a policy for periodic rotation of the API token within Okta.
    - **Securely manage and store the Terraform state file:** As the state file may contain the resolved value of the API token.

- **Description:** Exposure of Okta API token for Users feed.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** The `chronicle_feed_okta_users` resource requires an Okta API token (`value` in the `authentication` block) for authenticating with the Okta API to retrieve user information.
  - **Example:** A developer includes the Okta API token in plaintext within the Terraform configuration file.
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Okta user data, potentially including personal information, group memberships, and security settings. Attackers could use this information for social engineering or account takeover attempts.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Avoid storing the Okta API token directly in Terraform configuration:** Utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) for managing the token.
    - **Use the principle of least privilege for the API token:** Ensure the API token has only the necessary permissions to access user information.
    - **Regularly rotate the Okta API token:** Implement a policy for periodic rotation of the API token within Okta.
    - **Securely manage and store the Terraform state file:** As the state file may contain the resolved value of the API token.

- **Description:** Exposure of Proofpoint SIEM API credentials.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** The `chronicle_feed_proofpoint_siem` resource requires a username (`user`) and secret (`secret` in the `authentication` block) for authenticating with the Proofpoint SIEM API.
  - **Example:** A developer hardcodes the Proofpoint username and secret within the Terraform configuration.
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Proofpoint SIEM logs, potentially revealing email security events, threat intelligence, and other sensitive information. Attackers could use this information to understand security posture or identify potential targets.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Avoid storing the Proofpoint SIEM credentials directly in Terraform configuration:** Utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) for managing the username and secret.
    - **Use the principle of least privilege for the API credentials:** Ensure the API credentials have only the necessary permissions to access SIEM logs.
    - **Regularly rotate the Proofpoint SIEM API credentials:** Implement a policy for periodic rotation of the username and secret within Proofpoint.
    - **Securely manage and store the Terraform state file:** As the state file may contain the resolved values of these credentials.

- **Description:** Exposure of Qualys VM API credentials.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** The `chronicle_feed_qualys_vm` resource requires a username (`user`) and password (`secret` in the `authentication` block) for authenticating with the Qualys Vulnerability Management API.
  - **Example:** A developer includes the Qualys username and password in plaintext within the Terraform configuration file.
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Qualys VM data, potentially revealing vulnerability scan results, asset information, and security posture details. Attackers could use this information to identify vulnerable systems and plan attacks.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Avoid storing the Qualys VM credentials directly in Terraform configuration:** Utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) for managing the username and password.
    - **Use the principle of least privilege for the API credentials:** Ensure the API credentials have only the necessary permissions to access vulnerability data.
    - **Regularly rotate the Qualys VM API credentials:** Implement a policy for periodic rotation of the username and password within Qualys.
    - **Securely manage and store the Terraform state file:** As the state file may contain the resolved values of these credentials.

- **Description:** Exposure of Thinkst Canary API token.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** The `chronicle_feed_thinkst_canary` resource requires an authentication value (`value` in the `authentication` block) which is effectively an API token to authenticate with the Thinkst Canary API.
  - **Example:** A developer hardcodes the Thinkst Canary API token within the Terraform configuration.
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Thinkst Canary instance, potentially allowing attackers to view alerts, create new canaries, or modify existing configurations, leading to the disruption of deception technology and potential exposure of real assets.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Avoid storing the Thinkst Canary API token directly in Terraform configuration:** Utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) for managing the token.
    - **Use the principle of least privilege for the API token:** Ensure the API token has only the necessary permissions within Thinkst Canary.
    - **Regularly rotate the Thinkst Canary API token:** Implement a policy for periodic rotation of the API token within Thinkst Canary.
    - **Securely manage and store the Terraform state file:** As the state file may contain the resolved value of the API token.

- **Description:** Potential manipulation of data through Reference Lists.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** The `chronicle_reference_list` resource allows managing lists of data (strings, regexes, CIDRs) that can be used in detection rules or other Chronicle functionalities. If an attacker gains control over these lists, they could insert malicious entries or remove legitimate ones, impacting the effectiveness of security monitoring.
  - **Example:** An attacker modifies a reference list used in a high-fidelity detection rule to exclude their malicious IP addresses, effectively blinding the security system to their activity. Alternatively, they could add malicious regex patterns that cause excessive resource consumption in rule processing.
  - **Impact:** Reduced effectiveness of detection rules, potential for false negatives or false positives, and possible denial-of-service within Chronicle's rule processing engine.
  - **Risk Severity:** Medium
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Implement strict access control for managing Reference Lists:** Limit the ability to create, modify, or delete reference lists to authorized personnel only.
    - **Implement version control or audit logging for Reference List changes:** Track modifications to reference lists to identify unauthorized changes.
    - **Regularly review the content of Reference Lists:** Ensure the lists contain only legitimate and expected data.
    - **Consider using infrastructure-as-code best practices for managing Reference Lists:** Store the definition of reference lists in version control and apply changes through controlled deployments.

- **Description:** Creation or modification of malicious detection rules.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** The `chronicle_rule` resource allows the creation and updating of detection rules written in YARA-L. An attacker with the ability to manipulate these resources could create rules that disable alerts for their activities, generate excessive false positives to overwhelm analysts, or potentially even exfiltrate data if Chronicle's rule engine allows such actions (depending on Chronicle's capabilities).
  - **Example:** An attacker creates a rule that matches their malicious activity but does not generate an alert, effectively hiding their presence. They could also modify an existing high-fidelity rule to significantly reduce its sensitivity, allowing attacks to go unnoticed.
  - **Impact:** Failure to detect malicious activity, increased noise from false positives, potential data exfiltration (depending on Chronicle's rule engine capabilities), and overall degradation of the security monitoring posture.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Implement strict access control for managing detection rules:** Limit the ability to create, modify, or delete rules to authorized security personnel only.
    - **Implement a review process for all rule changes:** Require a second pair of eyes to review and approve any new or modified detection rules before they are deployed.
    - **Utilize infrastructure-as-code best practices for managing detection rules:** Store the definition of rules in version control and apply changes through controlled deployments.
    - **Regularly audit existing detection rules:** Review the logic and effectiveness of existing rules to identify any potentially malicious or ineffective rules.
    - **Monitor rule creation and modification activity:** Alert on any unauthorized changes to detection rules.

- **Description:** Reliance on environment variables for API credentials.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** The provider supports authenticating with Chronicle APIs (BigQuery, Backstory, Ingestion, Forwarder) using environment variables (e.g., `CHRONICLE_BIGQUERY_CREDENTIALS`). If the environment where Terraform runs is compromised, these credentials can be exposed.
  - **Example:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD pipeline environment where Terraform is executed and retrieves the value of the `CHRONICLE_BACKSTORY_CREDENTIALS` environment variable, gaining access to the Chronicle Backstory API.
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Chronicle APIs, potentially leading to data breaches, modification of configurations, or disruption of services.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Secure the environment where Terraform is executed:** Implement strong access controls and monitoring for the systems and processes running Terraform.
    - **Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in environment variables where possible:** Prefer using dedicated secrets management solutions.
    - **If using environment variables, ensure they are properly secured and not logged or exposed inadvertently.**
    - **Regularly audit the environment variables used by Terraform.**

- **Description:** Potential credential exposure through file-based credentials with insecure permissions.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** The provider allows specifying credentials via file paths. If the files containing these credentials have overly permissive file system permissions, unauthorized users can read them. The `pathOrContents` function in `client/util.go` expands the `~` to the home directory, meaning files in user home directories are also potential targets if permissions are not restrictive.
  - **Example:** A Terraform configuration uses `backstoryapi_credentials = "~/chronicle_creds.json"`. If `chronicle_creds.json` has permissions like `777` or is world-readable, any user on the system can access the Chronicle API credentials.
  - **Impact:** Exposure of Chronicle API credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over the Chronicle instance.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Ensure that credential files used by the provider have restrictive file system permissions (e.g., 600 or 400).**
    - **Store credential files in secure locations on the file system, avoiding world-readable locations.**
    - **Avoid storing sensitive information in plaintext within these files; consider encrypting them at rest.**
    - **Prefer using secure secrets management solutions over file-based credentials.**
    - **Regularly audit file system permissions for credential files.**

- **Description:** Lack of enforced HTTPS for custom endpoints.
  - **How `terraform-provider-chronicle` contributes to the attack surface:** While the provider validates the format of custom endpoint URLs, it does not enforce the use of HTTPS. This means a user could potentially configure a feed or other integration to communicate over an insecure HTTP connection.
  - **Example:** A user configures a custom HTTP feed source using a non-HTTPS endpoint. This traffic could be intercepted and the data or credentials being transmitted could be exposed.
  - **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the insecure HTTP connection, including potential credentials or log data. Susceptibility to man-in-the-middle attacks.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Enforce HTTPS for all communication with Chronicle and external services within the provider code.**
    - **Provide clear warnings to users when configuring custom endpoints over HTTP.**
    - **Document the security risks associated with using non-HTTPS endpoints.**
    - **Consider disallowing HTTP endpoints altogether or requiring explicit user confirmation of the risk.**
