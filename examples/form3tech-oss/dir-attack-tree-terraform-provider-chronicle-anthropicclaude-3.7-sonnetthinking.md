# Threat Modeling Analysis for terraform-provider-chronicle Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

### Overview
Terraform-provider-chronicle is a Terraform provider for Google's Chronicle security platform. It allows users to configure and manage various Chronicle resources through Terraform's infrastructure-as-code approach. The provider facilitates the creation and management of data ingestion "feeds" from multiple sources, RBAC subjects, detection rules, and reference lists.

### Key Components and Features
- Authentication to Chronicle APIs (Backstory, BigQuery, Ingestion, Forwarder)
- Feed management for various data sources:
  - Cloud storage (Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage)
  - Queue services (Amazon SQS)
  - Security tools (Microsoft Office 365, Okta, Proofpoint, Qualys, Thinkst Canary)
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) management
- Rule creation and management
- Reference list management

### Dependencies
- Terraform SDK
- Chronicle API client
- Various authentication mechanisms for external data sources

## 2. Define the Root Goal of the Attack Tree

**Attacker's Ultimate Objective**: Compromise systems using the terraform-provider-chronicle by exploiting weaknesses in the provider to access sensitive security data or credentials.

## 3. High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)

1. **Credential Theft**: Steal credentials managed by the provider
2. **Chronicle Configuration Manipulation**: Manipulate Chronicle configurations to gain unauthorized access
3. **Provider Runtime Exploitation**: Exploit vulnerabilities in the provider's code execution
4. **Post-Exploitation**: Leverage compromised resources for further attacks

## 6. Critical Attack Paths

### High-Risk Paths

1. **Terraform State File Credential Exposure**
   - **Attack Path**: 1.1 → 1.1.1/1.1.2/1.1.3/1.1.4/1.1.5/1.1.6 → 4.1
   - **Risk**: Very High
   - **Justification**: Terraform state files often contain plaintext credentials that can be easily extracted and used for further attacks. This is a common security issue in Terraform deployments and the provider handles numerous high-value security tool credentials.

2. **Custom Endpoint Redirection**
   - **Attack Path**: 2.1.2 → 1.3.2
   - **Risk**: High
   - **Justification**: The provider allows setting custom API endpoints for Chronicle services with minimal validation. An attacker with access to the Terraform configuration could redirect API calls to a malicious server to intercept credentials and sensitive data.

3. **Security Control Subversion via Rule and Reference List Manipulation**
   - **Attack Path**: 2.3.1/2.4.1 → 4.2.2
   - **Risk**: High
   - **Justification**: The ability to create and modify detection rules and reference lists could be exploited to create blind spots in Chronicle's detection capabilities, enabling attackers to operate undetected.

4. **RBAC Subject Creation for Persistent Access**
   - **Attack Path**: 2.2.1 → 4.2.3
   - **Risk**: Medium
   - **Justification**: Creating RBAC subjects with elevated permissions could provide attackers with persistent access to Chronicle data, even after the initial compromise is remediated.

5. **Debug Mode Exploitation**
   - **Attack Path**: 1.3.1 → 4.1
   - **Risk**: Medium
   - **Justification**: The provider's debug mode opens port 2345 and could allow attackers to attach a debugger and access runtime values including credentials. While this requires local access, it's a significant risk in shared environments.

## 7. Mitigation Strategies

### For Credential Theft

1. **Secure Terraform State**
   - Use remote state with strong access controls and encryption
   - Implement state locking to prevent concurrent modifications
   - Consider using Terraform Cloud with enhanced security features

2. **Secure Credential Storage**
   - Use a secrets manager (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) instead of environment variables
   - Implement credential rotation policies
   - Use short-lived tokens where possible
   - Implement principle of least privilege for all credentials

3. **Debug Mode Security**
   - Restrict debug mode to development environments only
   - Ensure debug port (2345) is never exposed outside localhost
   - Add authentication requirement for debug connections
   - Disable debug mode in production deployments

### For Chronicle Configuration Manipulation

1. **Custom Endpoint Protection**
   - Enhance validation for custom endpoint URLs beyond basic URL validation
   - Implement allowlists for approved custom endpoints
   - Add warnings when non-standard endpoints are used
   - Require additional authentication for custom endpoints

2. **RBAC Safeguards**
   - Implement mandatory access control policies
   - Add confirmation steps for privilege escalation
   - Log and alert on suspicious RBAC changes
   - Require multi-person approval for sensitive RBAC changes

3. **Rule and Reference List Validation**
   - Implement peer review for rule and reference list changes
   - Add validation to prevent overly broad or potentially dangerous detection rules
   - Create automated testing for rules to detect potential blind spots
   - Monitor and alert on suspicious rule or reference list modifications

### For Provider Runtime Exploitation

1. **Terraform Configuration Security**
   - Validate Terraform configuration files before execution
   - Use signed provider binaries
   - Verify provider checksums before installation

2. **Supply Chain Security**
   - Implement stringent code review for all changes
   - Use dependency scanning tools
   - Sign releases with hardware security keys
   - Require multiple approvers for releases

### For Post-Exploitation Defense

1. **Credential Scope Limitation**
   - Restrict credentials to minimum required permissions
   - Implement just-in-time access for critical resources
   - Use credential-specific policies to prevent misuse

2. **Activity Monitoring**
   - Monitor for unusual API access patterns
   - Implement alerting for suspicious feed configurations
   - Audit rule changes, RBAC modifications, and reference list updates
   - Enable comprehensive logging for all Chronicle API operations

## 8. Summary of Key Findings

The terraform-provider-chronicle introduces several significant security risks:

1. **Credential Exposure**: The provider handles sensitive credentials for multiple cloud providers and security services (AWS, Azure, Qualys, Thinkst Canary, etc.). These credentials can be exposed through Terraform state files, environment variables, and during debugging.

2. **Feed Configuration Risks**: The ability to configure custom endpoints and modify feed authentications creates the potential for credential theft and data redirection attacks.

3. **Security Control Manipulation**: The ability to create and modify detection rules and reference lists could be exploited to weaken Chronicle's security monitoring capabilities.

4. **RBAC Manipulation**: The provider's ability to create and modify RBAC subjects could allow privilege escalation if misused.

To address these risks, implementations should focus on:

1. Securing Terraform state files to prevent credential exposure
2. Implementing strict validation for custom endpoints
3. Using the principle of least privilege for all credentials
4. Implementing comprehensive review processes for rule and reference list changes
5. Limiting debug mode usage to development environments only
6. Implementing comprehensive monitoring and auditing for all Chronicle operations

## 9. Questions & Assumptions

### Questions
1. How is the Chronicle client authenticating to the various API endpoints? The code references multiple credential types, but the exact authentication flow is unclear.
2. What validation mechanisms exist for custom endpoints beyond basic URL validation?
3. What checks are in place to validate minimum permissions for credentials?
4. Are there any additional validation mechanisms for rules and reference lists beyond basic syntax checking?

### Assumptions
1. The provider is typically run with administrative access to Chronicle and potentially to other data sources.
2. Debug mode is not used in production environments.
3. Most implementations will use remote state storage for Terraform.
4. Users are following standard Terraform security practices.
5. The provider is used in security-sensitive environments where Chronicle is monitoring critical infrastructure.
