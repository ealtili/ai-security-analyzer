# Threat Modeling Analysis for AI Nutrition-Pro Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

Project Name: AI Nutrition-Pro

### Overview

AI Nutrition-Pro is an application designed to provide AI-powered content generation, primarily focused on diet and nutrition, for integration with external Meal Planner applications. It acts as a backend service that receives requests from Meal Planner apps, potentially uses Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to generate content based on provided samples, and returns the results. It also includes a control plane for managing clients (Meal Planner apps), configuration, and billing.

### Key Components and Features

-   **API Gateway (Kong):** Acts as the entry point for external systems (Meal Planner apps). Handles authentication (API keys), authorization (ACLs), input filtering, and rate limiting.
-   **Web Control Plane (Golang, ECS):** Manages the administrative and client onboarding/management aspects. Used by Administrators, App Onboarding Managers, and Meal Planner application managers. Interacts with the Control Plane Database.
-   **Control Plane Database (Amazon RDS):** Stores data related to the control plane, including tenant information, configuration, and billing data.
-   **API Application (Golang, ECS):** The core backend service that provides the AI content generation functionality. Receives requests from the API Gateway, interacts with the API Database, and utilizes the external ChatGPT LLM.
-   **API Database (Amazon RDS):** Stores data specific to the API functionality, including dietitian's content samples, LLM requests, and responses.
-   **Administrator:** A human user responsible for system configuration and problem resolution via the Web Control Plane.

### Dependencies

-   **External Systems:**
    -   **Meal Planner application:** External web applications integrating with AI Nutrition-Pro via REST/HTTPS using API keys.
    -   **ChatGPT-3.5 (OpenAI):** An external LLM used by the API Application via REST/HTTPS.
-   **Technologies/Platforms:**
    -   Golang (for Web Control Plane and API Application)
    -   Kong API Gateway
    -   AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)
    -   Amazon RDS (for both databases)
    -   HTTPS/REST for communication between components and external systems.
    -   TLS for database connections from application containers.

## 2. Define the Root Goal of the Attack Tree

Attacker's Ultimate Objective: **Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or disrupt AI Nutrition-Pro services by exploiting weaknesses within the AI Nutrition-Pro system.**

*(Refinement: This goal specifically targets the AI Nutrition-Pro system's vulnerabilities, not general infrastructure attacks outside the scope of the application's design.)*

## 3. Identify High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)

2.  Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in a database (Control Plane DB or API DB).
3.  Disrupt the availability or integrity of AI Nutrition-Pro services.
4.  Exploit vulnerabilities in the external integrations (Meal Planner or ChatGPT interactions).
5.  Compromise the Administrator's access.

## 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

### High-Risk Paths

*   **Compromising a core application container (1.1, 1.2, 1.3):** Especially exploiting application-level vulnerabilities (1.2.1, 1.3.1) and misconfigurations (1.1.2, 1.2.3, 1.3.3). These nodes have high likelihood and critical impact as they can lead directly to data breaches (2.1.2, 2.2.2) or full system compromise. Application logic flaws (injection, broken access control) are common and often have high impact. Misconfigurations are also frequent and can be easy to exploit.
    *   *Justification:* A compromised application container provides direct access to internal networks, configuration, and potentially credentials, allowing lateral movement to databases or other services. Application-level vulnerabilities are within the project's direct control and often the most direct path to sensitive data or critical functions.
*   **Gaining unauthorized access to databases via compromised containers (2.1.2, 2.2.2):** If an attacker compromises an application container, accessing its associated database becomes highly likely and has critical impact due to the sensitive data stored (tenant data, billing, dietitian samples, LLM interactions). Retrieving credentials from a compromised container (2.1.2.2, 2.2.2.2) is a particularly high likelihood step if credentials are not securely managed (e.g., hardcoded, weak secrets management).
    *   *Justification:* The databases hold the most sensitive information. If an attacker gains a foothold in an application layer, accessing the database is a primary objective and often straightforward if internal network controls and credential management are weak.
*   **Exploiting input validation weaknesses leading to backend exploits (4.1.2.1):** This path originates from the external Meal Planner integration but exploits a weakness *within* AI Nutrition-Pro's handling of input. This is a classic attack vector (e.g., SQL Injection, RCE) and can lead to container compromise (1.3) or direct data access (2.2). It has high likelihood and critical impact if successful.
    *   *Justification:* External inputs are a primary attack surface. Flaws in processing untrusted data are incredibly common and severe, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or access/modify data.
*   **Prompt Injection (4.2.1):** While the immediate impact might seem lower (High vs Critical), the potential to steal sensitive data from LLM context (4.2.1.1) or inject malicious/harmful content into AI-generated output delivered to *end-users* (4.2.1.2) poses significant privacy, security, and reputational risks. This is a novel threat specific to the LLM integration.
    *   *Justification:* This threat directly exploits the unique nature of the LLM integration. It could lead to data breaches (of LLM interaction history, which might contain sensitive input/output) or the system being used to spread misinformation or harmful content, impacting users of the Meal Planner apps.
*   **Compromising Administrator's access (5.0):** Gaining admin credentials (5.1) is a high likelihood step with critical impact, as the admin can access the Web Control Plane to configure the entire system, access sensitive tenant/billing data, and potentially trigger critical actions.
    *   *Justification:* The administrator has privileged access across the system. Compromising this role grants wide-ranging capabilities, from data theft to service disruption and system misconfiguration for future attacks.

### Critical Nodes

Addressing these nodes could significantly mitigate multiple attack paths:

*   **Input Validation (4.1.2):** Robust input validation at the API Gateway and within the API Application is critical to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities originating from Meal Planner inputs.
*   **Access Controls (1.2.1.3, 1.3.1.2, 4.1.3):** Strong authentication (API keys, Admin login) and authorization (ACLs, application-level checks) are fundamental to prevent unauthorized access to functions and data.
*   **Credential Management (2.1.2.2, 2.2.2.2):** Securely managing database and potentially LLM API credentials is vital. Using secrets management services (like AWS Secrets Manager) instead of storing credentials in code or environment variables accessible from a compromised container.
*   **Vulnerability Management (1.1.1, 1.2.1, 1.3.1, 1.2.2, 1.3.2, 2.1.1, 2.2.1):** Regularly updating software (Kong, Golang, libraries, RDS) and the underlying OS/runtime reduces the attack surface from known vulnerabilities. Secure coding practices are essential to prevent application-specific vulnerabilities.
*   **Misconfiguration Prevention (1.1.2, 1.2.3, 1.3.3, 2.1.3, 2.2.3):** Ensuring AWS security groups, ECS task definitions, RDS configurations, and Kong configurations follow security best practices is crucial. Principle of Least Privilege should be applied rigorously (e.g., DB user only has necessary permissions, app containers cannot access other containers/services unnecessarily).
*   **Administrator Access Security (5.0):** Implementing strong authentication (MFA), secure session management, and potentially network restrictions for administrative access to the Web Control Plane.

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies

Based on the prioritized risks and critical nodes:

1.  **Implement Robust Input Validation:**
    *   Perform strict validation and sanitization of all input received from Meal Planner applications at the API Gateway (using Kong plugins/features) and again within the API Application code.
    *   Use parameterized queries or ORMs for all database interactions to prevent SQL injection (1.2.1.1, 1.3.1.1, 2.1.2.1, 2.2.2.1).
    *   Sanitize or filter user-provided input before passing it to the LLM to mitigate prompt injection risks (4.2.1). Consider using LLM-specific input sanitization techniques or moderation APIs.
2.  **Strengthen Access Controls:**
    *   Ensure API keys are strong, securely stored by Meal Planner apps, and rotated regularly. Implement mechanisms to detect and revoke compromised keys (4.1.1).
    *   Review and strictly enforce ACL rules in Kong (4.1.3).
    *   Implement granular authorization within the Web Control Plane and API Application (1.2.1.3, 1.3.1.2) to ensure users/tenants can only access their own data and functions.
    *   Apply the Principle of Least Privilege for all database users and application roles.
3.  **Enhance Credential Management:**
    *   Use AWS Secrets Manager or a similar secure secrets management solution to store database credentials and the ChatGPT API key. Do not hardcode credentials or store them in easily accessible configuration files within containers (2.1.2.2, 2.2.2.2).
    *   Configure application containers to retrieve secrets securely at runtime.
4.  **Establish Comprehensive Vulnerability Management:**
    *   Implement a process for regular security patching and updates for Kong Gateway, Golang runtime, application dependencies, and the underlying container OS images (1.1.1, 1.2.2, 1.3.2).
    *   Keep Amazon RDS instances updated with the latest security patches (2.1.1, 2.2.1).
    *   Conduct regular security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning) of the application code (Golang apps) and infrastructure.
5.  **Prevent Misconfigurations:**
    *   Automate infrastructure deployment using IaC (Infrastructure as Code) to ensure consistent and secure configurations for ECS tasks, RDS instances, and security groups (1.2.3, 1.3.3, 2.1.3, 2.2.3).
    *   Restrict network access to databases (RDS) so they are only accessible from the necessary application containers (API App, Web Control Plane) and administrative hosts, not the public internet or other unnecessary internal networks.
    *   Configure Kong Gateway securely, following best practices.
6.  **Secure Administrator Access:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies and require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all administrator accounts accessing the Web Control Plane (5.1.2).
    *   Limit administrative access to the Web Control Plane to specific IP ranges or VPNs if possible.
    *   Implement logging and monitoring for administrative actions (partially outside scope, but critical).
    *   Regularly train administrators on security best practices (e.g., phishing awareness) (5.1.1).
7.  **Mitigate DoS Risks:**
    *   Ensure effective rate limiting is configured and monitored in Kong Gateway (3.1.1).
    *   Implement resource limits on ECS tasks to prevent a single compromised or overwhelmed container from impacting the entire service (3.2.1, 3.3.1).
    *   Monitor database performance and resource usage (3.4.2).
    *   Implement mechanisms to handle ChatGPT API errors or rate limits gracefully within the API Application (3.3.4).

## 9. Summarize Findings

### Key Risks Identified

The primary risks stem from potential compromises of the application containers (Web Control Plane and API Application) and the databases they interact with. Application-level vulnerabilities (injection, broken access control) and infrastructure misconfigurations are highly likely attack vectors that can lead to critical data breaches (tenant data, dietitian samples, LLM interactions) or full system compromise. The external integration points, particularly the handling of input from Meal Planner apps and the interaction with the ChatGPT LLM (Prompt Injection), introduce significant and specific risks that require careful mitigation. Compromise of the Administrator's account is a direct path to high-impact system control.

### Recommended Actions

Prioritize securing the application code against common web/API vulnerabilities, implementing strong input validation and access controls, securing credentials using a secrets manager, and establishing robust configuration management for the AWS environment (ECS, RDS, Security Groups). Pay specific attention to mitigating prompt injection risks in the LLM integration and securing the API key mechanism used by Meal Planner apps. Enhance administrator account security with MFA and access restrictions. Regularly update all software components and dependencies.

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

*   **Questions:**
    *   What specific versions of Kong Gateway, Golang, and relevant libraries are being used? (Impacts likelihood of exploiting known vulnerabilities).
    *   How are database credentials and the ChatGPT API key currently stored and managed? (Critical for assessing credential theft risk).
    *   What are the specific AWS Security Group configurations between containers and databases? Are databases accessible from anywhere other than the application containers?
    *   What level of logging and monitoring is in place for application errors, security events (e.g., failed logins, access denied), and infrastructure changes?
    *   What specific input filtering/validation is currently implemented in the API Gateway and API Application?
    *   How is context managed and isolated between different Meal Planner requests when interacting with ChatGPT? (Relevant to 4.2.1.1 - stealing data from previous interactions).
    *   Are API keys generated with sufficient entropy, and is there a mechanism for detection of brute-force attempts or compromise?
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   The diagram is a high-level overview, and there might be other components or communication paths not explicitly shown.
    *   Standard security practices for AWS (e.g., VPCs, subnets) are likely followed, but specific security group rules and network segmentation details are unknown.
    *   Application code (Golang) is developed in-house, introducing potential custom vulnerabilities.
    *   Amazon RDS instances are standard deployments, not necessarily leveraging advanced security features unless explicitly configured.
    *   The "filtering of input" by the API Gateway is assumed to provide some level of protection, but its effectiveness is unknown.
    *   TLS between application and database implies encryption in transit, but configuration details (e.g., certificate validation) are not specified.
