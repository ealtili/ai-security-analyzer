BUSINESS POSTURE

The primary business goal of the AI Nutrition-Pro project is to provide AI-powered content generation capabilities to dietitians by integrating with existing Meal Planner applications. This allows dietitians to leverage large language models (LLMs) to create content like diet introductions, potentially increasing their efficiency and the quality of their output within the platforms they already use. Key business priorities include:
*   Enabling seamless integration with various Meal Planner applications.
*   Providing reliable and performant AI content generation.
*   Establishing a scalable platform for onboarding and managing clients (Meal Planner apps and their users).
*   Ensuring the privacy and security of dietitian content samples and generated data.
*   Implementing a functional billing system based on usage.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed are:
*   Data breaches exposing sensitive dietitian content samples or client billing data.
*   Service downtime impacting the ability of dietitians to generate content.
*   Poor quality or inappropriate content generated by the LLM impacting user trust.
*   Failure to integrate correctly or reliably with diverse Meal Planner applications.
*   Inaccurate billing leading to financial loss or customer disputes.
*   Regulatory non-compliance regarding data handling (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, depending on data type).

SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls identified:
*   security control: Authentication with Meal Planner applications using individual API keys (Implemented by API Gateway, described in Security section).
*   security control: Authorization of Meal Planner applications using ACL rules allowing or denying certain actions (Implemented by API Gateway, described in Security section).
*   security control: Encrypted network traffic between Meal Planner applications and API Gateway using TLS (Implemented by API Gateway, described in Security section).
*   security control: Encrypted network traffic between internal containers (Web Control Plane to Control Plane DB, API Application to API database) using TLS (Described in Container diagram relationships).

Accepted risks:
*   No explicit accepted risks were mentioned in the provided file.

Recommended security controls (high priority):
*   Recommended security control: Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received from external systems (Meal Planner Apps, potential Admin input) and internal components before processing or sending to the LLM.
*   Recommended security control: Implement output sanitization and potentially content filtering on responses received from the LLM before returning them to the client.
*   Recommended security control: Implement detailed logging and monitoring of security events (authentication failures, authorization denials, suspicious requests, data access) across all components.
*   Recommended security control: Securely manage API keys and other secrets (e.g., database credentials, LLM API keys) using a dedicated secrets management system.
*   Recommended security control: Implement rate limiting not only at the API Gateway but also potentially within the backend API to protect against abuse if the gateway is bypassed or misconfigured.
*   Recommended security control: Conduct regular security testing, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
*   Recommended security control: Implement secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) practices, including code reviews focused on security, static application security testing (SAST), and dependency vulnerability scanning as part of the build process.
*   Recommended security control: Implement network segmentation to restrict traffic flow between different containers and databases based on the principle of least privilege.

Security Requirements:
*   Authentication: All external access to the API Gateway must be authenticated using unique API keys. Administrator access to the Web Control Plane must be authenticated using strong credentials, preferably multi-factor authentication. Internal component communication should ideally use authenticated methods where appropriate (e.g., service accounts, mTLS).
*   Authorization: Access to API endpoints must be authorized based on the authenticated identity (API key/client). Administrator actions on the Web Control Plane must be authorized based on roles and permissions. Internal components should only have permissions necessary for their function (least privilege).
*   Input Validation: All input received from external users (Meal Planner Apps) and internal users (Admin) must be validated against expected formats, types, and constraints to prevent injection attacks, data corruption, and other vulnerabilities. This includes data sent to the LLM.
*   Cryptography: All data transmitted over public networks must be encrypted using strong TLS versions and cipher suites. Sensitive data at rest (e.g., API keys, potentially sensitive content samples depending on classification) should be encrypted. Secrets (database credentials, LLM API keys) must be stored and managed securely using encryption.

DEPLOYMENT

The AI Nutrition-Pro system is designed to be deployed on AWS. A typical deployment architecture would involve deploying the containerized applications (API Gateway, Web Control Plane, API Application) onto an AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The databases (Control Plane Database, API Database) would be deployed as Amazon RDS instances within the same VPC, ideally in private subnets. Access from the internet would be managed via an Application Load Balancer (ALB) routing traffic to the API Gateway. Administrator access to the Web Control Plane might be via a separate protected endpoint, VPN, or bastion host.

Deployment Architecture Option: AWS ECS/RDS within a VPC

This option provides scalability, managed services, and network isolation.

BUILD

The build process for the AI Nutrition-Pro components (Web Control Plane, API Application) would typically follow a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. When a developer pushes code changes to a version control repository (e.g., Git), a CI server (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) is triggered. The server fetches the code, builds the application binaries, runs unit and integration tests, performs static analysis (SAST), checks for vulnerable dependencies, and potentially performs code linting. If all checks pass, Docker images for the application components are built. These images are then scanned for known vulnerabilities. Finally, the approved Docker images are pushed to a secure container registry (e.g., Amazon ECR). These images then become the artifacts used for deployment.

Security controls in the build process include:
*   Using a secure version control system with access control and audit trails.
*   Automating builds to ensure consistency and prevent manual tampering.
*   Integrating SAST tools to identify common code vulnerabilities.
*   Integrating dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   Scanning container images for vulnerabilities before pushing to the registry.
*   Using signed commits and potentially signed build artifacts.
*   Implementing access controls on the CI server and artifact repository.

RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
1.  AI Content Generation Flow: The process where a request from a Meal Planner App is received, potentially combined with dietitian samples, sent to the LLM, and the response is returned. This is the core value proposition.
2.  Client Onboarding and Management: The process of adding new Meal Planner Apps as clients, configuring their access, and managing billing information. This is critical for business operations and revenue.
3.  Dietitian Content Sample Management: The process of receiving, storing, and using dietitian samples for LLM prompts. This data is sensitive and directly impacts the quality of the AI output.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
1.  Dietitian Content Samples: Text content provided by dietitians to guide the LLM. Sensitivity depends on the content, but could include proprietary writing styles, potentially sensitive dietary information if dietitians include case studies, or even PII if not properly anonymized before submission. Generally considered sensitive business data.
2.  LLM Requests and Responses: The prompts sent to ChatGPT and the generated text received back. Prompts may contain parts of dietitian samples and specific user requirements. Responses are the AI-generated content. Sensitivity is linked to the samples and the generated output, which could be considered confidential until delivered to the end user.
3.  Client Configuration Data: API keys, ACL rules, integration settings for each Meal Planner App. Sensitive as compromise could lead to unauthorized access or service disruption.
4.  Billing Data: Usage metrics, client details relevant for billing. Sensitive financial and business data.
5.  Administrator Credentials and Configuration: Highly sensitive data granting access to manage the entire system.

QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
1.  What is the expected volume of requests and data storage requirements?
2.  Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) that dictate how dietitian samples or user data must be handled?
3.  What is the data retention policy for dietitian samples and LLM requests/responses?
4.  What are the specific security requirements or constraints imposed by integrating with ChatGPT-3.5 (e.g., data usage policies by OpenAI)?
5.  Is there a requirement for multi-tenancy isolation beyond just API key authentication (e.g., data segregation)?
6.  What level of availability and disaster recovery is required for the platform?
7.  Are there specific requirements for administrator access security (e.g., mandatory MFA)?
8.  How is PII handled within the dietitian content samples, or is it assumed samples are anonymized?

Assumptions:
*   Standard AWS security practices (e.g., patching, monitoring infrastructure logs) are followed for the underlying cloud environment.
*   The internal network within the VPC is generally more trusted than the public internet, but container-level security controls are still necessary.
*   API keys are treated as secrets and managed securely by both AI Nutrition-Pro and the consuming Meal Planner Applications.
*   The primary threat vectors are external attacks via the API Gateway and administrator interface, as well as potential vulnerabilities within the application code or third-party libraries.
*   The quality and security of the external ChatGPT-3.5 service and API are assumed to be managed by OpenAI.
*   The system will initially be deployed in a single AWS region.
