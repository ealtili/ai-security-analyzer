## Threat Enumeration

1. **Spoofing**
   - **Threat:** An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by redirecting HTTP/HTTPS requests to malicious servers, especially if SSL verification is disabled.

2. **Tampering**
   - **Threat:** Unauthorized modification of HTTP/HTTPS response data.
   - **Exploitation:** Without proper SSL/TLS verification, attackers can alter data in transit, modifying request parameters or responses.

3. **Repudiation**
   - **Threat:** Users or attackers denying actions or transactions performed due to lack of proper logging or tracking.
   - **Exploitation:** Improper reuse or failure to clear authentication headers could allow malicious actions without accountability.

4. **Information Disclosure**
   - **Threat:** Leakage of sensitive data such as authentication tokens, cookies, or headers to unintended destinations.
   - **Exploitation:** Improper handling of redirects (e.g., from HTTPS to HTTP) might send sensitive headers over insecure channels (e.g., CVE-2018-18074).

5. **Denial of Service**

## Mitigation Recommendations

1. **Spoofing**
   - **Recommendation:** Enforce SSL certificate verification by default and discourage or deprecate the use of `verify=False`.
   - **Implementation:** Update `src/requests/sessions.py` and `src/requests/adapters.py` to enforce SSL verification and add warnings when disabled.

2. **Information Disclosure**
   - **Recommendation:** Ensure sensitive headers like `Authorization` are not forwarded when redirecting from HTTPS to HTTP or to different domains.
   - **Implementation:** Modify redirection logic in `src/requests/sessions.py` to strip sensitive headers appropriately.

3. **Tampering**
   - **Recommendation:** Strengthen SSL/TLS verification and provide secure defaults.
   - **Implementation:** Similar to recommendation 1; ensure SSL verification cannot be easily disabled.

4. **Dependence on Vulnerable Dependencies**
   - **Recommendation:** Regularly update dependencies to secure versions and implement dependency checks.
   - **Implementation:** Update `setup.py` and `setup.cfg` to require minimum secure versions and set up CI/CD checks for vulnerabilities.

5. **Insecure Test Server Configuration**
