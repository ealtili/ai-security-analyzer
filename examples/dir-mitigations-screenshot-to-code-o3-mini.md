Below is a list of mitigation strategies specific to the “screenshot‐to‐code” project. Each strategy details step‐by‐step actions for developers (and in some cases, users) to reduce risks, the threats it mitigates (with an indication of severity), the impact on overall risk reduction, where in the project some measures are already implemented, and where further work is needed.

---

## 1. Input Validation and Path Sanitization for Filesystem Operations

**Mitigation Strategy:**
Enforce strict validation and canonicalization of folder/file paths (especially in evals endpoints) so that user‐supplied paths cannot traverse outside the approved EVALS directory.

**Description:**
1. When a folder parameter is received (e.g. in the `/evals` and related endpoints), resolve its absolute path.
2. Compare the path with a hardcoded base directory (e.g. the known EVALS_DIR) to verify that the requested folder is a subdirectory of the approved location.
3. Remove or reject any input containing directory traversal patterns (e.g. “../”).
4. Log rejected attempts for audit and alert.

**Threats Mitigated:**
– Directory traversal and unauthorized file access (Severity: High)

**Impact:**
Prevents attackers from reading or modifying files outside the designated evaluation folder. This measure greatly reduces the risk of data leakage or system compromise from improper file access.

**Currently Implemented:**
The evals endpoints use basic filesystem methods (e.g. `Path(folder)` and `os.listdir`) but do not validate that the folder is restricted to the intended base directory.

**Missing Implementation:**
A whitelist or dynamic check confirming that every provided folder path is underneath the expected base (e.g. EVALS_DIR) is not in place and should be added.

## 2. Rate Limiting and Access Authentication for Public Endpoints

**Mitigation Strategy:**
Implement per-IP rate limiting and require API or user authentication for endpoints that are publicly exposed (such as the WebSocket `/generate-code`, `/api/screenshot`, and eval endpoints).

**Description:**
1. Introduce middleware to gate requests based on IP or API token usage.
2. For endpoints that trigger expensive operations (e.g. code generation or screenshot capture), enforce strict request rate limits.
3. Require clients to present valid credentials or tokens to access these endpoints.
4. Monitor usage patterns and log anomalous behavior.

**Threats Mitigated:**
– Denial of Service (DoS) under high request rates and abuse of external API endpoints (Severity: High)

**Impact:**
Reduces system overload risks and abuse of external service credits while also damping potential DoS attacks, lowering the chance of resource‐exhaustion attacks.

**Currently Implemented:**
No dedicated rate limiting or authentication mechanisms are evident in the project routes.

**Missing Implementation:**
A robust rate‐limiting middleware and/or API key / user authentication for critical endpoints needs to be designed and integrated.

## 3. Secure API Key Management and Handling

**Mitigation Strategy:**
Improve the handling and audit of API credentials so that sensitive keys do not leak through logs, error messages, or insecure storage.

**Description:**
1. Ensure that API keys (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Replicate) are only read from secured environment variables or provided transiently (for instance, stored only in the browser for client configuration).
2. Scrub keys from logs and error messages by using redaction utilities in logging modules.
3. Enforce HTTPS for any API calls to external services to ensure keys are transmitted securely.
4. Regularly audit code and configuration files to ensure keys are not accidentally hardcoded or exposed.

**Threats Mitigated:**
– Credential leakage and subsequent unauthorized use (Severity: High)

**Impact:**
By keeping API keys isolated and not revealing them in logs or errors, the risk of credential theft and misuse is substantially reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
The project instructs users to store keys in environment files and mentions that keys from settings dialog are stored only in the browser. However, keys might still appear in error logs if not carefully managed.

**Missing Implementation:**
Perform a thorough audit and add specialized logging routines that explicitly redact sensitive fields. Consider using secure secrets management for deployment.

## 4. URL Sanitization and SSRF Protection for Screenshot Endpoint

**Mitigation Strategy:**
Validate and restrict URLs submitted for screenshot capture so that the server does not inadvertently access internal resources or malicious URLs.

**Description:**
1. When the `/api/screenshot` endpoint receives a URL, first validate that it is well‑formed.
2. Implement a whitelist of allowed URL schemes and domains (or at least reject internal IP ranges and localhost).
3. Reject or flag URLs that do not pass the whitelist criteria.
4. Log any attempts to access non‑approved URLs.

**Threats Mitigated:**
– Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) where an attacker could force the server to access internal resources or external malicious endpoints (Severity: High)

**Impact:**
Restricts abuse of the screenshot API. This prevents misuse of server resources and inadvertent exposure of internal network information.

**Currently Implemented:**
The `/api/screenshot` endpoint forwards the URL directly to the external API without verifying that the URL is safe.

**Missing Implementation:**
A URL validation/whitelisting mechanism is not present. Developers must add such checks to ensure no harmful URL is processed.

## 5. Robust Multimedia Processing Safeguards

**Mitigation Strategy:**
Ensure all video and image processing routines validate file content and size before proceeding, with comprehensive exception handling to prevent resource exhaustion.

**Description:**
1. In video and image processing functions (e.g. in `image_processing/utils.py` and `video/utils.py`), verify that the incoming base64–encoded data does not exceed preset maximum sizes.
2. Check image dimensions and file format before invoking processing libraries.
3. Use structured try/except blocks to catch and log any processing errors.
4. Downscale or reject files that are unreasonably large or malformed.

**Threats Mitigated:**
– Denial of Service (DoS) via oversized or malicious media files that aim to exhaust processing resources
– Potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in processing libraries (Severity: Medium–High)

**Impact:**
Prevents resource-exhaustion attacks and protects backend services from crashes or long processing times due to malicious input.

**Currently Implemented:**
The image processing code contains logic to check dimensions and file sizes and attempts downscaling. However, boundary conditions and exhaustive exception handling could be further tightened.

**Missing Implementation:**
Enhanced validation rules, explicit upper bounds on allowed media sizes, and comprehensive error logging and reporting mechanisms should be added.

## 6. Logging Best Practices and Sensitive Data Sanitization

**Mitigation Strategy:**
Adopt a logging strategy that sanitizes logs of sensitive data and restricts access to log files.

**Description:**
1. Review all log entries (especially in modules such as `fs_logging/core.py`) so that sensitive API keys, prompt details, and other credentials are removed or masked.
2. Incorporate log sanitization libraries or custom routines to automatically remove sensitive substrings before writing logs.
3. Set strict file system permissions on logs and ensure that only authorized processes/users can read them.
4. Periodically audit log contents for inadvertent leak of sensitive information.

**Threats Mitigated:**
– Information disclosure via logs (especially if logs are shared or compromised) (Severity: Medium)

**Impact:**
Significantly lowers the risk that an attacker obtaining log files will glean sensitive operational details or credentials.

**Currently Implemented:**
Logs are written (e.g. in `fs_logging/core.py`) without explicit sanitization of sensitive data.

**Missing Implementation:**
Introduce sanitization functions for log content and configure log file permissions appropriately.

## 7. Container Security and Secure Dependency Management

**Mitigation Strategy:**
Harden the container environment and manage dependencies proactively to avoid exploitation via outdated libraries or misconfigured container settings.

**Description:**
1. Update Dockerfiles to run the application as a non‑root user within the container.
2. Regularly update base images (for example, switch to a more secure and minimal base with patched vulnerabilities).
3. Use security scanners (e.g. Snyk, Clair) to audit dependencies and container images.
4. Limit container privileges and enforce resource quotas.

**Threats Mitigated:**
– Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in outdated libraries or container breakouts due to running as root (Severity: Medium to High)

**Impact:**
Reduces the overall attack surface, ensuring that even in case of a compromise, the damage is contained and access to host systems is limited.

**Currently Implemented:**
The Dockerfiles use a slim base image (e.g. Python 3.12.3-slim-bullseye) which is a good start but do not drop root privileges.

**Missing Implementation:**
Configure the Docker images to run as non‑root users and add explicit security options in container orchestration.

## 8. WebSocket Message Validation and Payload Limiting

**Mitigation Strategy:**
Implement verification of incoming WebSocket messages and enforce payload size limits to prevent injection or overload attacks.

**Description:**
1. Set a maximum allowed payload size for incoming WebSocket messages.
2. Validate and sanitize message contents before processing them (for example, verify that JSON structures meet expected schemas).
3. Monitor and limit the rate of messages arriving via WebSocket connections.
4. Drop or close connections that send malformed or overly large data.

**Threats Mitigated:**
– Injection attacks via WebSocket messages and Denial-of-Service through large or high-frequency messages (Severity: Medium)

**Impact:**
Prevents malicious actors from sending harmful data over WebSocket connections, ensuring that the code-generation process cannot be derailed by oversized or malformed inputs.

**Currently Implemented:**
The WebSocket route in `/generate-code` accepts messages without explicit payload size limits or sanitization checks.

**Missing Implementation:**
Lifecycle management for WebSocket connections (e.g., payload size limits, input validation) needs to be added in the websocket handler code.

---

## 9. Prevention of Prompt Injection and Model Misuse

**Mitigation Strategy:**
Sanitize and isolate system and user prompt components such that user input cannot covertly alter system instructions.

**Description:**
1. Structure prompt assembly functions (e.g. `assemble_prompt` and `assemble_imported_code_prompt`) so that system instructions are kept strictly separate.
2. Sanitize any user-supplied text that is inserted into user messages before integration.
3. Limit the user’s ability to override key parts of the system prompt by enforcing fixed system prompt content.
4. Implement logging and monitoring of prompt changes that could indicate injection attempts.

**Threats Mitigated:**
– Prompt injection attacks that might alter the behavior of the LLM and cause it to generate unintended or insecure code (Severity: Medium)

**Impact:**
Helps ensure that the AI model always receives a trusted base instruction set and that user input does not inadvertently (or maliciously) subvert safety protocols, reducing the impact of model misuse.

**Currently Implemented:**
The project uses dedicated functions to assemble prompts; however, the split between system and user messages could be made even more robust.

**Missing Implementation:**
Additional sanitization and boundary enforcement could be added to the prompt assembly routines to further isolate system instructions from user-provided content.
