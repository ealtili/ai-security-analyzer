Below are the mitigation strategies directly addressing threats identified in the AI Nutrition‑Pro architecture as described in the FILE.

- **Mitigation Strategy: API Key Lifecycle Management & Rotation**
  **Description:**
  • Ensure that each Meal Planner application uses a unique API key with a well‐defined lifecycle.
  • Implement a rotation schedule so that keys are replaced regularly or immediately upon detecting misuse.
  • Securely store API keys (for example, in secure environment variables or a dedicated secrets manager) and employ anomaly detection on key usage to trigger revocation if needed.
  **Threats Mitigated:**
  • Unauthorized access if an API key is compromised (High severity).
  • Abuse of privileges due to long‑lived keys (High severity).
  **Impact:**
  • When implemented properly, the risk of unauthorized access via compromised API keys can be reduced by approximately 80%.
  **Currently Implemented:**
  • The system already issues individual API keys for Meal Planner applications.
  **Missing Implementation:**
  • There is no documented lifecycle management (e.g., key rotation, revocation, and secure storage practices) for API keys in the current configuration.

- **Mitigation Strategy: Automated ACL Rule Testing and Validation in API Gateway**
  **Description:**
  • Use the Kong API Gateway’s ACL feature as the basis for access control, but complement it with automated tests that verify the ACL rules are configured as intended.
  • Define the expected access policies for each client, then create and integrate test scripts (e.g., as part of the CI/CD pipeline) to simulate various requests and validate correct access behavior.
  • Regularly review and update tests whenever new endpoints or policy changes are applied.
  **Threats Mitigated:**
  • Misconfigurations in ACL rules that could allow unauthorized access (High severity).
  **Impact:**
  • Consistent and automated validation helps catch misconfigurations before they reach production, reducing unauthorized access risks by around 60–70%.
  **Currently Implemented:**
  • ACL rules are defined in the API Gateway to authorize Meal Planner applications.
  **Missing Implementation:**
  • There is no automated or continuous validation process to test and validate these ACL configurations as part of deployment.

- **Mitigation Strategy: Data Minimization & Sanitization for ChatGPT Integration**
  **Description:**
  • Before sending requests from the API Application to ChatGPT‑3.5, perform a careful review and sanitization of the data payloads.
  • Identify any sensitive or non‑essential information in the data samples and remove or mask it so that only information strictly needed for AI content generation is transmitted.
  • Insert a dedicated data processing layer or middleware that sanitizes outgoing requests, followed by testing to verify that no confidential data is inadvertently exposed.
  **Threats Mitigated:**
  • Data exfiltration or leakage of sensitive information via the external ChatGPT interface (High severity).
  **Impact:**
  • Proper data minimization techniques can significantly lower the risk of exposing sensitive data—potentially reducing this risk by up to 80%.
  **Currently Implemented:**
  • The system integrates with ChatGPT‑3.5 for AI content generation, but there is no mention of a dedicated sanitization or data masking process for outbound requests.
  **Missing Implementation:**
  • A clearly defined mechanism (middleware or data filtering process) to sanitize data before transmitting requests to ChatGPT is absent.

- **Mitigation Strategy: Anti-Replay Mechanism for API Requests**
  **Description:**
  • Enhance the API Gateway (or the backend API) to validate that each incoming request is unique by incorporating nonce values or timestamps.
  • Require that each API request includes either a unique identifier or a timestamp, and reject any duplicate or out-of-window requests.
  • Log any suspected replay attempts for further review.
  **Threats Mitigated:**
  • Replay attacks whereby intercepted valid API keys could be reused to submit unauthorized repeated requests (Medium‑High severity).
  **Impact:**
  • Introducing anti‑replay measures will substantially cut the potential for replay-based unauthorized access, reducing this risk by around 60%.
  **Currently Implemented:**
  • Although TLS encryption is applied to communications, there is no explicit mechanism mentioned for replay protection through nonce or timestamp checks.
  **Missing Implementation:**
  • There is a gap in the implementation regarding replay attack prevention. A mechanism to enforce request uniqueness (e.g., nonce/timestamp validation) is not currently in place.

These mitigation strategies focus on addressing specific security challenges introduced by the AI Nutrition‑Pro application as architected. Implementing them would help ensure that the integration points and external communications (using API keys and ChatGPT) are more resilient against targeted misuse and sophisticated attacks.
