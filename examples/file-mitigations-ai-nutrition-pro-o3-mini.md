Below are five targeted mitigation strategies addressing threats that are introduced by the AI Nutrition-Pro architecture. Each strategy is tailored to specific risks found in the design (e.g. integration with external systems, inter-service communications, and container deployments), going beyond generic measures.

---

## 1. Enhanced API Gateway Input Validation & Monitoring with Custom Kong Plugins

**Description:**
• Review and extend the current Kong configuration to enforce schema validation and advanced threat detection.
• Implement custom plugins or rules to detect patterns specific to injection attempts (e.g. SQL injection, command injection) or payload anomalies.
• Configure logging and real-time monitoring in Kong so that suspicious requests trigger alerts.
• Regularly update and test the custom rules to adapt to emerging attack patterns.

**Threats Mitigated:**
• Malicious payload injections (high severity)
• Denial‐of‐service via malformed requests (medium severity)
• Exploitation of API endpoints via unexpected input formats (medium to high severity)

**Impact:**
• Expected risk reduction is significant (up to 80–90%) in blocking sophisticated injection and payload attacks.

**Currently Implemented:**
• The architecture already uses Kong for authentication, filtering, and rate limiting, though only basic filtering is mentioned.

**Missing Implementation:**
• No evidence of enhanced or custom validation rules, anomaly detection plugins, or detailed logging/alerting mechanisms within Kong is documented.
• Detailed configuration for custom threat-detection logic and response is lacking.

## 2. API Key Lifecycle Management for Meal Planner Integrations

**Description:**
• Integrate a key management system (e.g. a secure vault) to manage API keys for each Meal Planner application.
• Enforce policies that require periodic key rotation and set expiration dates for all keys.
• Implement active monitoring for unusual API key usage or repeated authentication failures.
• Create automated revocation procedures that trigger if misuse is detected.

**Threats Mitigated:**
• API key compromise leading to unauthorized access (high severity)
• Identity spoofing or abuse of credentials (medium to high severity)

**Impact:**
• Enhances trust in client authentication and can reduce the risk of compromised keys by up to 70% by limiting exposure duration and enabling rapid revocation.

**Currently Implemented:**
• The design specifies that each Meal Planner integration uses an individual API key for authentication.

**Missing Implementation:**
• There is no detailed mechanism for API key rotation, expiration, or real-time monitoring and automated revocation outlined in the current architecture.

## 3. Data Sanitization & Privacy Preservation for External LLM Communication

**Description:**
• Introduce a data sanitization layer within the API Application that processes and filters outgoing data before sending queries to ChatGPT-3.5.
• Identify and mask or remove any sensitive or non-essential data elements that should not leave the internal environment.
• Establish validation routines for responses from ChatGPT to ensure that sensitive information has not been inappropriately included.
• Log all transactions and perform periodic audits to verify data minimization practices.

**Threats Mitigated:**
• Potential exposure of sensitive information or personally identifiable data (medium to high severity)
• Data leakage when interfacing with an external LLM service (medium severity)

**Impact:**
• If properly implemented, the sanitization process can reduce data leakage risks by approximately 60%, ensuring that only the minimal required information is transmitted externally.

**Currently Implemented:**
• HTTPS is used for communication with ChatGPT-3.5, ensuring encryption in transit.

**Missing Implementation:**
• There is no dedicated sanitization or data minimization step described in the integration flow with ChatGPT.
• No validation of ChatGPT responses or filtering of sensitive fields has been planned or documented.

## 4. Mutual TLS (mTLS) & Service-to-Service Authentication Enhancements

**Description:**
• Extend the current TLS encryption setup to implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for all service-to-service communications in the application.
• Issue and manage X.509 certificates for each container/service (e.g. API Gateway, backend API, Web Control Plane, etc.).
• Configure each service in the AWS Elastic Container Service environment to validate the certificate of the calling service before processing requests.
• Establish automated certificate rotation and revocation processes to maintain continued trust.

**Threats Mitigated:**
• Man-in-the-middle attacks (high severity) within internal networks
• Unauthorized lateral movement or spoofing between microservices (high severity)

**Impact:**
• Enforcing mTLS can lower the risk of internal communications being compromised by up to 75%, ensuring that only trusted services interact.

**Currently Implemented:**
• TLS is already used for communication between the Web Control Plane and its database, and between the API Application and its database.

**Missing Implementation:**
• There is no evidence that mTLS or mutual authentication is configured for inter-service communication between the API Gateway, backend services, or among containers themselves.

## 5. Container Security Hardening & Runtime Isolation

**Description:**
• Harden Docker container images by using minimal and secure base images, timely patching software dependencies, and removing unnecessary packages.
• Integrate container scanning tools (both static and runtime) into the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
• Apply runtime isolation policies (using features like seccomp, AppArmor, or AWS ECS task roles) to limit container privileges and restrict inter-container communications.
• Implement network segmentation at the container level and enforce strict access controls between containers.

**Threats Mitigated:**
• Container breakout and exploitation of known vulnerabilities (high severity)
• Lateral movement between services within the container infrastructure (high severity)

**Impact:**
• With proper hardening and isolation, overall container-related threat exposure can be reduced by up to 70%, protecting the integrity of each service.

**Currently Implemented:**
• The application is deployed using Docker containers on AWS Elastic Container Service, which provides a baseline level of orchestration.

**Missing Implementation:**
• There is no documentation or visible configuration addressing container image hardening, regular vulnerability scanning, or runtime isolation specifics beyond standard deployment.
