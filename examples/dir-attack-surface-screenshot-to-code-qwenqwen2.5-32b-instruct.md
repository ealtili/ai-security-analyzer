# Attack Surface Analysis for `screenshot-to-code`

## Key Attack Surfaces

### 1. **API Key Exposure and Misuse**
- **Description:**:
  The application relies heavily on API keys for services like Openai, anthropic, and replicate. These keys are stored either in the environment or in the UI. Improper handling of these keys could expose them, leading to unauthorized usage or abuse.
- **How `screenshot-to-code` Contributes:**
  The backend reads API keys from environment files (`.env) and the frontend allows direct entry of API keys in the settings dialog.
- **Example:**
  If an attacker gains access to the backend server or can intercept the frontend API key entry, they can misuse the API keys for unauthorized requests, leading to financial cost and resource abuse.
- **Impact:**
  High - Leads to financial and resource abuse, potentially draining API credits.
- **Risk Severity:**
  High
- **Current Mitigations:**
  - Storing keys securely in environment files and not in code or VCS.
  - No evidence of further encryption or obfuscation.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Implementing encryption or hashing for stored API keys.
  - Implementing strict access controls to the frontend settings dialog.
  - Adding rate limitingers and IP whitelisting for API key usages.

  - Employing secrets management tools or service.

  - Regularly rotating and auditing API keys.

  The backend has CORS settings allowing all (`"*"`) origins, methods, and headers. This could allow for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and other cross-origin attacks.
- **Example:**
  An attacker can craft a malicious web page that makes requests to the backend server, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
- **Impact:**
  High - Allows a variety of cross-origin attacks leading to data leakage and unauthorised actions.

  High - Leads to unauthorized data access and potential data tampering.
- **Risk Severity:**
  High
- **Current Mitigations:**
  None identified.
