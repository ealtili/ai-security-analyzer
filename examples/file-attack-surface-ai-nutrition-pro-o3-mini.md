    - Meal Planner Application:
      - Description: External web application connecting via HTTPS/REST to the API Gateway to upload content samples and retrieve AI-generated results.
    - ChatGPT-3.5 API:
      - Description: External Large Language Model service accessed over HTTPS/REST by the API Application for content generation.

- Communication Channels and Security:
  - All communication between external systems and internal components (API Gateway, Web Control Plane, API Application) is encrypted using TLS/HTTPS.
  - Databases communicate with their associated applications over TLS.

- Potential Vulnerabilities / Insecure Configurations:
  - Weak or misconfigured API key management and ACL rules at the API Gateway could allow unauthorized access.
  - Inadequate input validation in the API Application may permit injection or payload tampering.
  - Possible misconfigurations in TLS/HTTPS settings risking interception or man-in-the-middle attacks.
  - Container misconfigurations or outdated dependencies in Golang components could introduce vulnerabilities.

## Threat Enumeration
- Spoofing:
  - Description: An attacker might impersonate a legitimate Meal Planner application by exploiting weak API key management or bypassing ACL rules, thereby gaining unauthorized access.
  - Affected Components: API Gateway, External integrations.

- Tampering:
  - Description: Malicious actors could modify API requests or payloads—through injection or manipulation—to alter data integrity as it transits through the API Gateway to the API Application and databases.
  - Affected Components: API Gateway, API Application, API Database, and Control Plane Database.

- Repudiation:
  - Description: Inadequate logging or audit trails could enable attackers to perform and later repudiate unauthorized actions, complicating incident detection and forensic investigation.
  - Affected Components: API Gateway, Web Control Plane, API Application.

- Information Disclosure:
  - Description: Sensitive data stored in the Control Plane Database or API Database (including tenant data, billing information, and dietitian content) might be exposed due to intercepted communications (if TLS misconfigurations exist) or insecure database configurations.
  - Affected Components: Both databases, API Gateway, API Application.

- Denial of Service (DoS):
  - Description: Attackers could overwhelm the API Gateway or API Application by bypassing rate limits or sending excessive requests, resulting in degraded performance or complete unavailability of the service.
  - Affected Components: API Gateway, API Application, and potentially the underlying databases if overwhelmed.

- Elevation of Privilege:
  - Description: Exploits in the Golang code, container misconfigurations, or inadequate access control mechanisms might allow an attacker to escalate their privileges, gaining unauthorized access to administrative functions or sensitive data.
  - Affected Components: Web Control Plane, API Application, Databases.

## Impact Assessment
- Spoofing:
  - Potential Impact: High
  - Analysis: Successful spoofing could compromise the authentication mechanism, leading to unauthorized API access, data manipulation, and a breach of integrity and confidentiality.

- Tampering:
  - Potential Impact: Medium to High
  - Analysis: Modifying payloads in transit or corrupting database entries can lead to inaccurate AI outputs, corrupted configurations, and a loss of data integrity.

- Repudiation:
  - Potential Impact: Medium
  - Analysis: Without sufficient audit trails, malicious activities may go unnoticed or be misattributed, delaying incident response and complicating forensics.

- Information Disclosure:
  - Potential Impact: High
  - Analysis: Exposure of sensitive client, tenant, or billing data can have serious privacy and financial implications, affecting confidentiality with long-term business repercussions.

- Denial of Service (DoS):
  - Potential Impact: Critical
  - Analysis: Flooding attacks that incapacitate key components (API Gateway or API Application) directly affect system availability, potentially causing full service outages.

- Elevation of Privilege:
  - Potential Impact: Critical
  - Analysis: If attackers gain higher privileges, they could manipulate system configurations, access sensitive data, or introduce persistent threats—all compromising confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Threat Ranking
1. Denial of Service (DoS) – Critical
   - Justification: The ease with which an attacker could overwhelm publicly exposed components (especially the API Gateway) makes DoS one of the highest risks, with immediate impact on system availability.
2. Elevation of Privilege – Critical
   - Justification: Compromise of internal components via vulnerabilities or misconfigurations can lead to full administrative control, posing an extreme risk to the overall system.
3. Information Disclosure – High
   - Justification: Exposure of sensitive data (tenant configurations, billing, and dietitian content) could lead to significant privacy and trust issues.
4. Spoofing – High
   - Justification: Successful impersonation compromises authentication measures, enabling further exploitation and unauthorized access.
5. Tampering – Medium to High
   - Justification: Although potentially damaging to data integrity, successful tampering requires precise exploitation; however, its consequences remain severe.
6. Repudiation – Medium
   - Justification: While less immediately catastrophic, insufficient audit trails can hinder incident response and increase the fallout from other compromise events.

## Mitigation Recommendations
- For Spoofing:
  - Strengthen API Key Management: Implement robust generation, rotation, and secure storage of API keys.
  - Enhance Authentication: Employ mutual TLS (mTLS) for both external and internal communications where feasible.
  - Regular ACL Reviews: Continuously audit and adjust API Gateway ACL rules to ensure only authorized access.

- For Tampering:
  - Input Validation and Sanitization: Enforce strict input validation at the API Gateway and within the API Application.
  - Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF): Filter and monitor malicious payloads to prevent injection attacks.
  - Integrity Checks: Implement data integrity verification mechanisms on payloads and critical data fields.

- For Repudiation:
  - Comprehensive Logging: Establish tamper-evident logging across all systems, ensuring that all API requests and administrative actions are recorded.
  - Secure Audit Trails: Utilize secure, centralized log aggregation and monitoring tools to facilitate rapid incident analysis and response.

- For Information Disclosure:
  - Enforce End-to-End Encryption: Regularly verify TLS configurations and certificate validity for all communications.
  - Database Hardening: Apply role-based access control (RBAC) and least privilege principles to database access; ensure encryption at rest.
  - Routine Security Audits: Schedule regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing of database configurations and network channels.

- For Denial of Service (DoS):
  - Rate Limiting and Traffic Filtering: Strengthen rate limiting on the API Gateway; implement mechanisms to drop or throttle abnormal traffic loads.
  - DDoS Protection: Leverage DDoS mitigation services and continuous traffic monitoring to identify and block attack patterns.
  - Scalability Measures: Configure autoscaling on backend services to handle sudden surges in traffic.

- For Elevation of Privilege:
  - Regular Code Reviews & Security Testing: Conduct frequent security audits and code reviews for the Golang applications to identify vulnerabilities.
  - Harden Container Configurations: Follow container security best practices on AWS ECS, including using minimal base images and regular patching.
  - Strict Access Controls: Implement multi-factor authentication and enforce the principle of least privilege across all administrative interfaces.
