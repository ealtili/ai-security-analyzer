MITIGATION STRATEGIES

1. **Rate Limiting and Input Filtering at API Gateway**

   - **Description:**
     - Ensure the API Gateway (Kong) maintains strict rate limiting and input filtering on requests from Meal Planner applications.
     - Configure thresholds per client to prevent request flooding (DoS).
     - Regularly update input validation rules to block malformed or malicious payloads.
     - Developers should write and maintain test cases checking the gateway against boundary and exploitative inputs.
   - **Threats Mitigated:**
     - API abuse or DDoS by clients (High severity)
     - Injection payloads at the gateway level (Medium to High)
   - **Impact:**
     - Drastically reduces risks of DDoS and some classes of immediate API-based attacks, as well as some basic injection attempts before they reach deeper systems.
   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - The architecture description indicates authentication, filtering, and rate limiting take place in Kong.
   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - Specifics of input validation rules and ongoing tuning are not described—customization and ongoing review may be needed for new vectors.

2. **Strict Authentication and API Key Management**

   - **Description:**
     - Each Meal Planner app receives a unique API key for authentication.
     - Require strong, random key generation and secure delivery.
     - Frequently rotate keys and provide a self-serve/revocation mechanism via the control plane.
     - Monitor for usage of old/compromised keys and alert on anomalies.
   - **Threats Mitigated:**
     - Unauthorized access via leaked/guessed keys (High)
     - Replay attacks or unauthorized API calls (High)
   - **Impact:**
     - Significantly lowers risk of unauthorized access or impersonation of legitimate Meal Planner apps.
   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - Mentions per-app API keys; details of lifecycle/key rotation/revocation process are not in the description.
   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - Key lifecycle, automated revocation, anomaly detection, and secure distribution require concrete procedures and code.

3. **Access Control Enforcement via ACLs on API Gateway**

   - **Description:**
     - Keep API Gateway ACLs reviewed and updated to restrict each client/app to only authorized endpoints and actions.
     - Implement least-privilege principle by default.
     - Integrate automated tests to verify unauthorized access attempts are denied.
   - **Threats Mitigated:**
     - Privilege escalation or over-permissive access (High)
     - Data leakage between tenants (High)
   - **Impact:**
     - Effectively restricts scope of what any compromised client can access; reduces the attack surface for horizontal privilege escalation and information leaks.
   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - Stated that there are ACL rules per-app in the gateway.
   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - Not clear if there are test cases, automated verification, or a process for prompt updating as clients are onboarded/offboarded.

4. **Secure Storage and Access of Content Samples and LLM Interactions**

   - **Description:**
     - Ensure Amazon RDS instances for API and control plane databases have strict network access controls.
     - Data in transit and at rest should be encrypted (already likely with Amazon RDS, confirm settings).
     - Implement row-level or schema-level access control in the app and database.
     - Audit access attempts to sensitive data (e.g., dietitian content, client information, LLM queries).
   - **Threats Mitigated:**
     - Data exfiltration/breach of sensitive dietary content or LLM API interactions (High)
     - Unauthorized internal or lateral access to stored data (High)
   - **Impact:**
     - Substantially reduces risk of data breach or unauthorized reading of sensitive information, both from the network and internal lateral movement.
   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - RDS and TLS are specified; details regarding further controls (application/database level restrictions) are missing.
   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - Any explicit mention of row-level security or internal monitoring of data access is absent.

5. **Segregation of Duties Between Web Control Plane and API Application**

   - **Description:**
     - Ensure clear separation between the control plane (onboarding, billing, configuration) and the API application (LLM access).
     - Use different AWS roles/policies for ECS deployments.
     - Restrict API application so it cannot modify onboarding or billing settings.
   - **Threats Mitigated:**
     - Abuse of admin/config paths by API application in case of compromise (Medium to High)
     - Lateral movement if one container is compromised (Medium)
   - **Impact:**
     - Limits “blast radius” from a single container compromise; makes privilege escalation more difficult.
   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - Containers are logically separate; unclear what role/policy separation is enforced in AWS and within the code.
   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - Specifics on IAM/policies between services and containers are absent.

6. **TLS/Encryption for All Inter-Container and External Traffic**

   - **Description:**
     - Ensure TLS is enforced for all connections: from/on all containers, fronting ELB or ECS, to RDS, and to OpenAI's API.
     - Regularly renew and update certificates.
     - Disable legacy ciphers and protocols.
   - **Threats Mitigated:**
     - Eavesdropping/man-in-the-middle attacks (High)
     - Credential or data leakage in transit (High)
   - **Impact:**
     - Drastically reduces risk of network-level data compromise.
   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - Stated all traffic is encrypted with TLS; implementation details (e.g., to OpenAI, intra-AWS traffic) not fully specified.
   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - Explicit confirmation of TLS / cipher configurations and client/server certificate verification across all links.

7. **Content Injection and Prompt Protection for LLM**

   - **Description:**
     - Sanitize or validate all content samples uploaded by Meal Planner apps before use in LLM prompts.
     - Apply allow-lists, character/type restrictions, and scan for injection attempts (prompt injection, jailbreaking, etc.).
     - Use context-aware prompt templating in the backend to prevent malicious user input manipulating prompt structure.
   - **Threats Mitigated:**
     - Prompt injection attacks or LLM misuse via malicious content (High)
     - Data or prompt leakage if LLM interpolates unintended context (High)
   - **Impact:**
     - Reduces risk of LLM returning sensitive information, manipulated outputs, or engaging in unintended behavior due to crafted user inputs.
   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - No mention of explicit input sanitization or prompt construction strategy.
   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - Needs prompt engineering review and a secure templating pattern; input validation/sanitization for LLM-bound fields is absent.

8. **Per-Tenant Data Isolation**

   - **Description:**
     - Enforce tenant isolation by tagging or scoping all data and queries within both the app and the database.
     - Double-check all API endpoints for leaks (e.g., access by client A to client B’s content).
     - Use ORM or middleware patterns to enforce tenant checks.
   - **Threats Mitigated:**
     - Data isolation failures (multi-tenancy breach) (Critical)
   - **Impact:**
     - Absolutely required for SaaS: prevents cross-client/breach-of-privacy incidents.
   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - Not clearly described in architecture; no indication of multi-tenancy isolation at the code or schema level.
   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - Specific patterns or mechanisms are not detailed; needs explicit engineering and verification.

9. **Robust Admin Role Management and Audit**

   - **Description:**
     - Define admin roles/actions in the control plane and limit actions to only those required.
     - Require strong authentication (consider MFA) for administrators.
     - Log and review all admin actions, with alerting for sensitive operations.
   - **Threats Mitigated:**
     - Abuse or compromise of admin credentials (High)
     - Insider threat or excessive privilege risk (High)
   - **Impact:**
     - Minimizes impact and duration of admin compromise; enables forensic investigation.
   - **Currently Implemented:**
     - Admin is mentioned; MFA, role restriction, and detailed audit logging are not described.
   - **Missing Implementation:**
     - Needs additional design around admin access, controls, and monitoring.
