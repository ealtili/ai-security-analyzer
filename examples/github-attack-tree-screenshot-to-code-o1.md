# Threat Modeling Analysis for "screenshot-to-code" Using Attack Trees

Below is a focused threat modeling exercise for the GitHub repository “screenshot-to-code” (https://github.com/abi/screenshot-to-code). This analysis concentrates on threats introduced by this specific project rather than on general best practices (e.g., typical logging, monitoring, or patching). The primary goal is to expose realistic attack paths that exploit vulnerabilities inherent in screenshot-to-code’s functionalities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. Analyze the Project Files
Review of the publicly available files in “screenshot-to-code” suggests it is a project that uses:
- A computer vision/machine learning model to interpret the layout or elements from input images (screenshots).
- A code generation module that outputs HTML/CSS or related front-end code approximating the layout in the screenshot.

Relevant files include:
- Python scripts or notebooks for machine learning model definition/training.
- Model weights or checkpoints for use in inference.
- Scripts that convert recognized image elements to code.
- Dependencies listed in requirements or environment files.

Potential hotspots:
- The AI model (potential malicious injection or tampering).
- The inference script that translates the model’s interpretation into code (possible code injection paths or non-sanitized output).
- The process that handles user-supplied images (maliciously crafted files).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. Understand the Project

### 2.1 Overview
“screenshot-to-code” aims to automate the process of turning design images (e.g., screenshots of UIs) into front-end code. Typical usage scenarios include:
1. Designers providing a screenshot of a UI mock-up.
2. The project’s model interpreting UI components.
3. Automated generation of HTML/CSS/JS or React code that approximates the UI design.

### 2.2 Key Components and Features
- ML/Deep Learning Model: Learns layout features from example screenshots.
- Code Generator: Translates recognized elements into code snippets.
- Image Preprocessing: Scales/crops images, possibly removing noise before feeding them to the model.

### 2.3 Dependencies
- Deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch).
- Libraries for image processing (e.g., PIL, OpenCV).
- Other utility packages (YAML/JSON parsing, web frameworks, etc.).
- Possibly a specialized environment or container for inference.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 3. Define the Root Goal (Attacker Objective)
The primary objective for an attacker is:
“Compromise applications that rely on screenshot-to-code by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the screenshot-to-code codebase, model, or outputs.”

Potential refinements include:
- Injecting malicious artifacts into the generated code.
- Corrupting or tampering with the ML model to produce exploitable outputs.
- Leveraging supply chain vectors (e.g., malicious code insertion) to compromise environments running screenshot-to-code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. Identify High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)
Below are major avenues for achieving the root goal:

1. Supply Chain Compromise
   • Inject or modify source code or ML model to introduce malicious functionality.

2. Code Generation Exploitation
   • Exploit how screenshot-to-code sanitizes (or fails to sanitize) the generated code.

3. Malicious Image Input
   • Craft images that cause the model or code generation logic to produce dangerous output, leading to code injection or environment compromise.

4. Model/Weight Tampering
   • Replace or alter the model’s weights so that specific triggers produce malicious code fragments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 5. Expand Each Attack Path with Detailed Steps

### Sub-Goal 1: Supply Chain Compromise
An attacker tries to insert malicious changes upstream in the screenshot-to-code project to eventually compromise downstream users.

1.1 Inject Malicious Code or Dependencies ([OR])
   - 1.1.1 Contribute Malicious Pull Request ([AND])
     • Bypass or exploit insufficient peer review on the repository.
     • Insert hidden payloads in code generation logic.
   - 1.1.2 Infect Project Dependencies ([AND])
     • Introduce or alter a third-party library version required by screenshot-to-code.
     • Utilize a maliciously published package with a trusted name.

### Sub-Goal 2: Code Generation Exploitation
An attacker tries to manipulate how screenshot-to-code produces front-end code, increasing the risk that the finalized code contains malicious elements.

2.1 Manipulate Post-Processing Steps ([OR])
   - 2.1.1 Insecure Template Injection ([AND])
     • The code generator uses templates or placeholders; attacker modifies these to inject scripts.
     • The final generated code has malicious script references.
   - 2.1.2 Encoding or Sanitization Bypass ([AND])
     • Exploit a missing or incomplete sanitization step.
     • Insert escaped characters that lead to arbitrary HTML/JS injection.

2.2 Remote Code Injection in Generated Artifacts ([OR])
   - 2.2.1 Force the generator to produce iframes or external references ([AND])
     • The generator is tricked into injecting references to an attacker-controlled domain.
     • When rendered or hosted, it loads harmful code from attacker’s server.

### Sub-Goal 3: Malicious Image Input
An attacker uploads a crafted image that leads to a malicious final output.

3.1 Exploit Vulnerability in Image Parsing ([OR])
   - 3.1.1 Buffer Overflow or Parsing Error ([AND])
     • If screenshot-to-code relies on libraries with known vulnerabilities in image parsing, attacker’s image could cause a memory corruption or code execution during preprocessing.

3.2 Force the Model to Generate Malicious Output ([OR])
   - 3.2.1 Adversarial Example Attack ([AND])
     • Create an image that specifically triggers undesirable or unexpected code generation.
     • The final code page might have embedded backdoors or XSS hooks.

### Sub-Goal 4: Model/Weight Tampering
An attacker strategically updates or replaces the pre-trained model to generate malicious results for certain triggers.

4.1 Replace Model Weights ([OR])
   - 4.1.1 Trojanized Model ([AND])
     • Provide a model with hidden triggers that produce malicious code only when specific patterns appear in the input image.
     • Hide these triggers from normal testing so they remain undetected during casual checks.

4.2 Poison Dataset or Training Procedure ([OR])
   - 4.2.1 Insert Poisoned Samples ([AND])
     • Pollute the dataset used to train or fine-tune the model.
     • The model consistently misclassifies images in a way that yields insecure code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 8. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

### 8.1 High-Risk Paths
1. Malicious Code Injection via Dependencies (1.1.2)
   • High impact and relatively low effort if an attacker can publish or compromise a dependency that screenshot-to-code trusts.

2. Trojanized Model (4.1.1)
   • Can remain hidden and only trigger on certain patterns. High impact on downstream generation with minimal detection in typical testing.

3. Encoding/Sanitization Bypass in Code Generation (2.1.2)
   • If user-supplied screenshot data influences strings in the generated code, an attacker could embed malicious scripts.

### 8.2 Critical Nodes
- Supply chain infiltration (node 1.1) ensures broad compromise potential.
- Model integrity (node 4.1) is crucial since any corrupted model undermines the entire generated output.

Justification: The above nodes require minimal direct attacker-to-victim interaction once compromised. Downstream applications automatically incorporate malicious or unsafe changes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 9. Develop Mitigation Strategies

Below are suggested countermeasures specific to the mechanics of “screenshot-to-code.” (General best practices like “update dependencies” or “enable logging and monitoring” are omitted here.)

1. Safeguard the Code Generation Process
   • Implement robust validation or filtering of text fragments that are turned into code.
   • Add an internal check (e.g., a “safe code pattern” function) that refuses to output <script> tags or iframes unless explicitly intended.

2. Ensure Model Integrity
   • Provide cryptographic verification or checksums for official model files to detect tampering.
   • Limit or track where model weights come from; do not allow arbitrary external sources to override them.

3. Validate Image Inputs
   • Restrict or sanitize complex image formats.
   • Validate image processing libraries to reduce risk from known image library parsing flaws.

4. Control the Development & Merge Process
   • Enforce stricter review on code that touches the generation logic or model loading code.
   • Require thorough verification on any ML model updates to catch suspicious changes in weighting or architecture.

5. Prevent Poisoned Training
   • Keep training data sets controlled.
   • Verify authenticity of contributed data sets or incremental training data.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 10. Summarize Findings

### 10.1 Key Risks Identified
- Supply chain attacks via malicious code or model infiltration.
- Code injection scenarios where unsanitized content from screenshots can manipulate generated code.
- Model tampering or poisoning that surreptitiously produces insecure outputs under certain conditions.

### 10.2 Recommended Actions
- Harden the code generation logic to detect and neutralize suspicious content.
- Ensure the integrity of model files and training data (e.g., via checksums/signatures).
- Systematically review and constrain image processing to prevent malicious format exploitation.
- Strategically gate contributions that can affect how the final code is generated or how the model is loaded.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 11. Questions & Assumptions

1. Does the screenshot-to-code project rely on external hosting or a container image that could be replaced and compromised?
2. Are users typically aware that the generated code might be unsanitized?
3. Is there an automated test or sample that would reveal unexpected tags (e.g., <script>, <iframe>) in generated output?
4. Assumption: The project uses standard secure hashing or differential checks to confirm model integrity. If not, additional steps must be taken.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This concludes the threat model focusing on vulnerabilities specific to the “screenshot-to-code” project. By reviewing these detailed attack paths, teams can prioritize mitigations that address the most potentially damaging and feasible threats arising from code generation, model tampering, and supply chain risks.
