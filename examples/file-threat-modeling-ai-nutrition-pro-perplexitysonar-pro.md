| DEP-004 | VPC | Misconfigured network access controls | Improper network segmentation could lead to unauthorized access | Partially mitigated through use of VPCs | Implement strict security group rules, use Network ACLs, regularly audit and review network configurations | Low - Requires misconfiguration of multiple network layers | High - Could lead to unauthorized internal network access | Medium |
| DEP-005 | API Gateway | Misconfiguration of API Gateway leading to unauthorized access | API Gateway configuration errors could bypass security controls | Partially mitigated through ACL rules | Regularly audit API Gateway configurations, use AWS Config rules to detect misconfigurations, implement least privilege access for API Gateway management | Low - Requires administrative mistakes in configuration | High - Could lead to bypass of authentication and authorization controls | Medium |

## BUILD THREAT MODEL

For this threat model, we'll assume a typical CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline.

### ASSETS

1. Source code repositories
2. CI/CD pipeline configurations
3. Build artifacts (container images, deployment packages)
4. Deployment scripts and configurations
5. Secrets used in the build process (API keys, credentials)

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

1. What specific security measures are in place for the ChatGPT-3.5 integration? Are there any rate limits or content filtering mechanisms?
2. How is data segregated between different Meal Planner applications in the API database?
3. Are there any compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) that need to be considered given the nature of the data being processed?
4. What is the process for rotating API keys for Meal Planner applications?
5. Is there a disaster recovery and business continuity plan in place?
6. How are container images built and scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment?
7. What monitoring and alerting systems are in place to detect and respond to security incidents?

Assumptions:
1. The application is deployed on AWS using ECS and RDS.
2. A typical CI/CD pipeline is used for building and deploying the application.
3. The application handles sensitive user data related to diet and nutrition.
4. The system is designed to handle multiple Meal Planner applications as clients.
5. ChatGPT-3.5 is used as-is without additional security wrappers or proxies.

This threat model provides a comprehensive overview of potential security risks in the AI Nutrition-Pro application across its application logic, deployment architecture, and build process. It should be regularly reviewed and updated as the system evolves or new threats emerge.
