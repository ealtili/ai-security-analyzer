# Threat Modeling Analysis for AI Nutrition-Pro

## 1. Understand the Project

**Project Name:** AI Nutrition-Pro

### Overview
AI Nutrition-Pro is an application designed to provide AI-powered content generation for nutrition and diet planning. It integrates with external "Meal Planner" applications used by dietitians and utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 for its Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities. The system is architected with a containerized approach, likely deployed on AWS. It features an API Gateway for client interactions, a Backend API for core functionality, and a Web Control Plane for administration and client management. Data is stored in dedicated databases for the control plane and the API application.

### Key Components and Features
*   **API Gateway (Kong):** Handles authentication (API keys), authorization (ACLs), input filtering, and rate limiting for external Meal Planner applications.
*   **Backend API (Golang, AWS ECS):** Provides the core AI Nutrition-Pro functionality via API. It interacts with the API Database and ChatGPT-3.5.
*   **API Database (Amazon RDS):** Stores dietitian's content samples, and requests/responses to the LLM.
*   **Web Control Plane (Golang, AWS ECS):** A web application for administrators and managers to onboard/manage clients, configure the system, and check billing data.
*   **Control Plane Database (Amazon RDS):** Stores data for the Web Control Plane, including tenant and billing information.
*   **Administrator:** An internal user role responsible for managing server configuration and resolving problems via the Web Control Plane.
*   **External Systems:**
    *   **Meal Planner Application(s):** External web applications that integrate with AI Nutrition-Pro to upload content samples and fetch AI-generated results.
    *   **ChatGPT-3.5:** External LLM API used for content generation.

### Dependencies
*   Kong API Gateway software.
*   Golang programming language and runtime.
*   AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS).
*   Amazon RDS for databases.
*   OpenAI ChatGPT-3.5 API.

## 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

### High-Risk Paths

1.  **Prompt Injection (5.1):**
    *   **Justification:** High likelihood due to the inherent nature of LLMs processing untrusted input. The impact is high, potentially leading to generation of harmful content, data leakage from prompt context, or service abuse. Defending against sophisticated prompt injection is notoriously difficult.
2.  **Compromise of Web Control Plane (3), especially via Administrator Account Compromise (3.2) or Application Vulnerabilities (3.1):**
    *   **Justification:** The Web Control Plane manages critical aspects like client onboarding, configuration, and billing. Compromise here (e.g., via phishing an admin or exploiting an XSS/IDOR/Auth bypass) has a high impact, potentially leading to full system control, financial fraud, or widespread data breach. Admin accounts are often targeted.
3.  **SQL Injection via Backend API (4.2.1) or Web Control Plane (4.1.1):**
    *   **Justification:** If Golang applications are not using parameterized queries consistently, SQLi is a realistic threat. Impact is high, allowing direct access/modification of sensitive data in API DB (dietitian samples, LLM logs) or Control Plane DB (tenant/billing info).
4.  **API Key Theft from Meal Planner Applications (1.2.1.1, leading to 6.1.4):**
    *   **Justification:** AI Nutrition-Pro relies on external Meal Planner apps securing their API keys. The likelihood of at least one such app being compromised is medium. The impact is high as the stolen key can be used to abuse the API, steal data, or inject malicious inputs. This is a supply chain risk.

### Critical Nodes for Mitigation

*   **Input Validation & Sanitization:**
    *   At API Gateway (1.2.3) for basic filtering.
    *   In Backend API (critical for preventing 2.1.1, 4.2.1, and as a first line for 5.1).
    *   In Web Control Plane (critical for preventing 3.1.2, 4.1.1).
*   **Secure Prompt Engineering & LLM Output Handling (Backend API - related to 5.1):** Designing prompts to clearly separate instructions from user data, and validating/sanitizing LLM outputs.
*   **Authentication & Authorization Mechanisms:**
    *   Web Control Plane (3.1.1, 3.1.3, 3.2): Strong authentication for admins (MFA), robust session management, strict authorization checks.
    *   API Gateway (1.2.1, 1.2.2): Secure API key management, correctly configured ACLs.
    *   Backend API (2.1.3): Internal authorization checks, not solely relying on API Gateway.
*   **Security of Administrator Credentials (3.2):** Protecting admin accounts is paramount.
*   **Database Access Controls & Credential Management (4.1.2, 4.1.3, 4.2.2, 4.2.3):** Securely managing DB credentials within applications and proper RDS network/access configuration.

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies

    *   **4.1.2, 4.2.2 (Compromised DB Credentials):** Store database credentials securely (e.g., using AWS Secrets Manager or similar, not hardcoded in application or config files). Rotate credentials regularly.
    *   **4.1.3, 4.2.3 (RDS Misconfiguration):** Configure RDS instances with private network access only. Apply strict security groups. Disable public snapshots. Use IAM database authentication if feasible.
*   **For 5. Exploit LLM Interaction Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **5.1 (Prompt Injection):**
        *   Implement input sanitization specifically designed to neutralize prompt injection attempts before data is included in prompts (e.g., escaping control characters, instruction filtering).
        *   Clearly demarcate instructions from user-supplied data within prompts (e.g., using XML tags, specific delimiters).
        *   Use "instruction defense" techniques in system prompts.
        *   Validate and, if necessary, sanitize LLM outputs before they are used or displayed.
        *   Consider using separate LLM contexts or instances per tenant if feasible and data sensitivity warrants it.
        *   Implement strict input length and complexity validation for data sent to LLM to prevent resource exhaustion.

## 9. Summarize Findings

### Key Risks Identified
The AI Nutrition-Pro application faces significant risks primarily from:
1.  **LLM-specific vulnerabilities:** Prompt injection poses a high risk due to the direct interaction with ChatGPT and user-supplied data, potentially leading to malicious content generation or data leakage. Data poisoning is also a concern.
2.  **Web application vulnerabilities in the Control Plane:** Compromise of the Web Control Plane, especially administrator accounts, could lead to full system control and access to sensitive tenant/billing data.
3.  **API security issues:** Theft of Meal Planner API keys or exploitation of vulnerabilities in the API Gateway or Backend API could lead to unauthorized data access, manipulation, or service disruption.
4.  **Standard injection flaws:** SQL Injection remains a critical threat to both databases if inputs are not handled correctly.

### Recommended Actions
1.  **Prioritize LLM Security:** Invest heavily in robust prompt engineering, input sanitization tailored for LLM interactions, and output validation. Continuously research and adapt to new prompt injection techniques.
2.  **Secure the Web Control Plane:** Enforce MFA for all administrative access. Conduct rigorous security testing (SAST, DAST, pentesting) focusing on authentication, authorization (IDOR), and XSS vulnerabilities.
3.  **Strengthen API Security:** Implement secure API key management practices for Meal Planner apps. Regularly audit API Gateway configurations (ACLs, rate-limiting, filtering). Ensure the Backend API performs its own authorization checks.
4.  **Prevent Injection Flaws:** Mandate the use of parameterized queries for all database interactions. Implement comprehensive input validation at all layers.
5.  **Secure Cloud Configuration:** Regularly audit AWS ECS and RDS configurations for security best practices, especially IAM roles, network access controls, and credential management.

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

### Questions
1.  What specific data within "dietitian's content samples" or LLM requests/responses is considered sensitive (e.g., PII, proprietary methods)? This affects the impact assessment of data breaches.
2.  What are the specific privileges and functionalities of the "App Onboarding Manager" and "Meal Planner application manager" roles within the Web Control Plane? Could compromise of these roles lead to significant system impact?
3.  Is there any fine-tuning of the LLM model based on the stored "dietitian's content samples"? If so, data poisoning (5.2) becomes a more direct and impactful threat to model integrity.
4.  What is the exact nature of "filtering of input" performed by the API Gateway? Is it a basic WAF, or does it attempt more sophisticated content analysis?
5.  Are there any plans for multi-tenancy isolation at the LLM interaction level, or is a shared ChatGPT context used for all requests?

### Assumptions
1.  The "filtering of input" by the API Gateway provides basic protection but is unlikely to be sufficient against sophisticated injection attacks, especially prompt injection, without specific, advanced rules.
2.  API keys issued to Meal Planner applications grant significant access to AI Nutrition-Pro's core functionalities, making their compromise impactful.
3.  The Web Control Plane is accessible over the internet for administrative purposes.
4.  The Amazon RDS databases are not directly exposed to the public internet and rely on application-layer security and AWS network controls (Security Groups, NACLs) for protection against direct network attacks.
5.  The TLS encryption mentioned for network traffic is implemented correctly with strong ciphers and proper certificate validation. This model focuses on application-layer and configuration threats.
6.  The Golang applications (Backend API, Web Control Plane) are custom-coded and their security depends on the secure coding practices adopted by the development team.
7.  "Administrator" refers to a human user with high privileges in the Web Control Plane.
