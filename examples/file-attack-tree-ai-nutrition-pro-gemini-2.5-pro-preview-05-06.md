## 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

### High-Risk Paths

1.  **Exploit LLM Interaction Vulnerabilities (2.2), especially Prompt Injection (2.2.1):**
    *   **Justification:** High likelihood due to the nature of LLMs and user-supplied input (dietitian samples). Low effort and skill for basic prompt injection. Impact is high, potentially leading to data exfiltration from `api_db` (sensitive dietitian content, past interactions), generation of harmful content affecting Meal Planners, or resource exhaustion. Detection is very hard. This is a novel and significant risk specific to AI applications.
2.  **Compromise Meal Planner Application's API Key (5.1) leading to malicious LLM input (5.1.1):**
    *   **Justification:** The security of AI Nutrition-Pro relies on the security of its clients (Meal Planners) to protect their API keys. If a Meal Planner is compromised, its key can be used to attack AI Nutrition-Pro, particularly its LLM interaction points. Likelihood of *some* Meal Planner being compromised is medium-high over time. Impact is high as it directly leads to path 2.2.1.
3.  **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Web Control Plane (3) leading to Admin Access/Abuse (3.1, 3.2):**
    *   **Justification:** The Web Control Plane manages tenants, billing, and configurations. A compromise here (e.g., via authentication flaws, code vulnerabilities, or admin compromise) has a high impact, potentially affecting all clients, leading to data breaches (control_plan_db), or full system takeover.
4.  **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Backend API Application (2.1, 2.3, 2.4):**
    *   **Justification:** As the core service processing requests and interacting with the LLM and `api_db`, vulnerabilities here (SQLi, code flaws) can directly lead to data compromise or service disruption. The use of Golang and ECS is generally secure, but custom code is always a potential source of vulnerabilities.

### Critical Nodes

*   **Backend API's LLM Prompt Construction Logic (related to 2.2.1):** This is where prompt injection defenses must be implemented.
*   **Web Control Plane Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms (related to 3.1):** Protecting admin access is paramount.
*   **API Gateway Configuration (ACLs, Input Filtering) (related to 1.1):** The first line of defense for the Backend API.
*   **Meal Planner API Key Management and Usage (related to 5.1):** Although partly external, AI Nutrition-Pro's design must consider the risk of compromised keys.
*   **Input validation and sanitization routines** in both the API Gateway and the Backend API, particularly for data used in LLM prompts or database queries.

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies

*   **For LLM Interaction Vulnerabilities (2.2):**
    *   **Input Sanitization/Validation for Prompts:** Rigorously sanitize and validate any user-supplied data (dietitian samples, parameters from Meal Planners) before incorporating it into LLM prompts.
    *   **Output Encoding/Validation from LLM:** Treat LLM output as untrusted user input. Sanitize or encode it before sending it to Meal Planners or storing it, especially if it could be rendered in a web context (prevent XSS).
    *   **Context Fencing/Instructional Prompts:** Use clear instructions in prompts to guide the LLM's behavior and limit its ability to act on injected instructions.
    *   **Monitor LLM Usage:** Track token usage per client to detect potential abuse or billing attacks (2.2.1.4).
    *   **Data Minimization in Prompts:** Only send necessary data to ChatGPT. Avoid sending sensitive internal data or PII if not strictly required for the task.
    *   **Regularly review OpenAI's best practices** for secure LLM integration.
*   **For Compromised Meal Planner API Keys (5.1):**
    *   **API Key Security Guidance:** Provide clear guidance to Meal Planner developers on securely storing and handling API keys.
    *   **Monitoring and Anomaly Detection:** Monitor API key usage for suspicious patterns (e.g., unusual volume, requests from unexpected IPs if feasible).
    *   **Per-Client Rate Limiting and Quotas:** Enforce strict rate limits and quotas per API key to limit the blast radius of a compromised key.
    *   **Consider short-lived API keys or more robust authentication** if feasible for Meal Planners.
*   **For Web Control Plane Vulnerabilities (3):**
    *   **Strong Authentication for Administrators/Managers:** Enforce MFA, strong password policies.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure roles within the control plane (Admin, App Onboarding Manager, etc.) have only necessary permissions.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Specifically target the Web Control Plane.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices for Golang Application:** Address common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10 equivalent for control planes).
    *   **Strict Session Management.**
*   **For Backend API Vulnerabilities (2):**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices (Golang):** Prevent SQLi (use parameterized queries/ORMs correctly), command injection, etc.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan Golang dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation at API Gateway and Backend API:** Defense in depth.
    *   **Proper Data Isolation:** If handling data for multiple tenants via the Backend API, ensure robust application-level controls to prevent data leakage between tenants, even if they share the `api_db`.
*   **For API Gateway (Kong) (1):**
    *   **Regular Configuration Reviews:** Ensure ACLs, authentication policies, and rate-limiting rules are correctly and securely configured.
    *   **Keep Kong Updated:** Patch Kong regularly to address known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Strict Input Filtering:** Configure Kong to filter known malicious patterns, but don't rely on it as the sole defense.
*   **For Database Security (4):**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for DB Users:** The Golang applications should connect to RDS with users that have minimal necessary permissions.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Ensure RDS instances are not publicly accessible and are only reachable from the ECS services.
    *   **Encryption at Rest and in Transit (TLS):** Already mentioned as in place, ensure it's correctly configured.
*   **For Administrator Compromise (6):**
    *   **Strong Authentication for Admin (MFA):** Critical for the Web Control Plane.
    *   **Security Awareness Training for Administrators:** Focus on phishing and social engineering.
    *   **Secure Admin Workstations.**

## 9. Summarize Findings

### Key Risks Identified

1.  **Prompt Injection against the LLM (ChatGPT):** High likelihood, high impact, allowing data exfiltration, generation of harmful content, or resource abuse. This is the most significant application-specific risk.
2.  **Compromise of Meal Planner API Keys:** Enables attackers to impersonate legitimate clients and launch attacks, including prompt injection.
3.  **Vulnerabilities in the Web Control Plane:** Could lead to complete system compromise, unauthorized access to tenant/billing data, and service disruption.
4.  **Standard Web Application Vulnerabilities (SQLi, Code Flaws) in Backend API/Control Plane:** Despite modern frameworks, custom code remains a risk.

### Recommended Actions

1.  **Prioritize implementing robust defenses against Prompt Injection:** This includes strict input sanitization for data used in prompts, output validation from the LLM, and context-aware prompt engineering.
2.  **Enhance security around API key management for Meal Planners:** Provide guidance, implement monitoring for anomalous key usage, and enforce strict rate limits/quotas.
3.  **Conduct a thorough security review and penetration test of the Web Control Plane,** focusing on authentication, authorization, and session management. Enforce MFA for all administrative access.
4.  **Implement secure coding practices and conduct regular security code reviews** for both Golang applications (Backend API and Web Control Plane).
5.  **Regularly review and harden the configuration of the API Gateway (Kong).**

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

### Questions:

1.  How are Administrator and other Control Plane user credentials managed? Are MFA and strong password policies enforced?
2.  What specific input filtering capabilities are configured in Kong? How tailored are they to the expected traffic?
3.  Is there any tenant separation logic within the `api_db`, or is it assumed that the Backend API correctly segregates data based on the API key?
4.  How are dietitian content samples uploaded and vetted before being stored in `api_db` and potentially used in prompts? Could a malicious Meal Planner poison these samples (indirect prompt injection)?
5.  What logging and monitoring capabilities are in place across the components (API Gateway, ECS applications, RDS)? How quickly can an attack be detected and responded to?
6.  Is the Golang code for Backend API and Web Control Plane subject to regular security code reviews or static/dynamic analysis?
7.  Are there any plans to fine-tune or retrain a model using data from `api_db`? If so, data poisoning becomes a more significant threat.

### Assumptions:

1.  The "Administrator" persona has high-level privileges, likely through the "Web Control Plane."
2.  Meal Planner applications are third-party and their internal security is outside the direct control of AI Nutrition-Pro, but their API keys are critical.
3.  Network connections between internal components (e.g., API Gateway to Backend API, ECS to RDS) are within a secured AWS environment (e.g., VPC) and not directly exposed externally.
4.  Basic AWS security best practices (e.g., IAM roles for ECS tasks, security groups) are being followed, so the focus is on application-layer vulnerabilities.
5.  The primary interaction with ChatGPT is stateless from ChatGPT's perspective for each API call (i.e., it doesn't retain memory of AI Nutrition-Pro's specific past interactions unless explicitly sent in the current prompt).
6.  "Filtering of input" by API Gateway is generic; specific vulnerabilities like advanced prompt injection might bypass it.
