## Key Attack Surfaces

### **1. API Key Exposure and Misuse**
**Description:**
Meal Planner applications authenticate via static API keys. If an API key is exposed or stolen, unauthorized access could occur.

**Contribution:**
The reliance on static API keys for authentication introduces a direct attack surface.

**Example:**
An attacker gains access to an API key through a leaked file or network interception, then uses it to access the API Gateway.

**Impact:**
Unauthorized access could lead to misuse of resources, data exfiltration, or denial of service attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Current Mitigations:**
- API keys are used for authentication.
- ACL rules restrict certain actions (but do not address key exposure).

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Rotate API keys periodically.**
- **Implement rate limiting per key** to detect and block suspicious activity.
- Use **short-lived tokens** (e.g., JWT with expiration) instead of long-lived API keys.

### **2. Improper API Gateway ACL Configuration**
**Description:**
ACL rules in the API Gateway may permit unintended access patterns or actions if misconfigured.

**Contribution:**
ACL rules are the primary authorization mechanism but lack details on validation or auditing.

**Example:**
An ACL rule accidentally grants write access to a sensitive endpoint to a Meal Planner application that should only have read access.

**Impact:**
Unauthorized modifications to data or configuration could compromise system integrity.

**Risk Severity:** High
**Current Mitigations:**
- ACL rules are enforced by API Gateway.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Regular audits of ACL rules** to ensure they align with least-privilege principles.
- **Automated validation** of ACL configurations during deployment.

### **3. Unvalidated Responses from ChatGPT-3.5**
**Description:**
The Backend API uses ChatGPT-3.5’s responses to generate content without validation, enabling potential injection attacks (e.g., malicious content injection).

**Contribution:**
The Backend API directly consumes unvalidated outputs from an external LLM, creating an attack vector.

**Example:**
ChatGPT-3.5 returns malformed or malicious content (e.g., SQLi payloads, XSS scripts) that is stored in the API database or returned to Meal Planner apps.

**Impact:**
Stored or transmitted malicious content could corrupt data, compromise systems, or harm users.

**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Current Mitigations:**
- No explicit measures described for validating ChatGPT responses.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Validate and sanitize all responses from ChatGPT-3.5** (e.g., remove code, detect anomalies).
- **Monitor ChatGPT API usage** for unusual patterns (e.g., unexpected response lengths).

### **4. Weak Database Access Controls**
**Description:**
The Control Plane Database and API Database may be exposed via insecure credentials or network configurations.

**Contribution:**
Databases are Amazon RDS instances but lack details on network isolation or credential management.

**Example:**
Default credentials are used, or databases are accessible over public networks without proper VPC restrictions.

**Impact:**
Compromise of databases could lead to exposure of sensitive tenant data, billing information, or API secrets.

**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Current Mitigations:**
- TLS encrypts traffic between components.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Enforce network isolation** (e.g., private subnets, security groups) for databases.
- **Rotate database credentials regularly** and avoid hardcoding them.
- **Enable RDS encryption at rest** and in transit.

---

### **5. Lack of Input Validation for Meal Planner Data**
**Description:**
Meal Planner applications upload dietitian content samples to the API Application without proper validation.

**Contribution:**
The API Gateway includes input filtering, but specifics (e.g., regex, content type) are not defined.

**Example:**
A Meal Planner app uploads a malicious content sample containing SQL injection payloads, which are stored in the API database.

**Impact:**
Injected payloads could corrupt data, lead to unauthorized data access, or exploit vulnerabilities in the backend.

**Risk Severity:** High
**Current Mitigations:**
- API Gateway includes "input filtering" (but specifics are unclear).

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Implement strict validation** for uploaded content (e.g., reject scripts, enforce content type checks).
- **Sanitize all user-provided inputs** before storage or processing.

---

### **6. Insecure Administrative Interface**
**Description:**
The Web Control Plane lacks details on authentication mechanisms for administrators.

**Contribution:**
Administrators manage sensitive configurations but may use weak authentication (e.g., no MFA, weak passwords).

**Example:**
An attacker compromises an administrator’s credentials via phishing and alters billing or tenant data.

**Impact:**
Full compromise of system configuration, billing fraud, or tenant data exposure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Current Mitigations:**
- No explicit security measures for administrator access.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Enforce MFA for administrative access** to the Web Control Plane.
- **Audit administrative actions** and log all configuration changes.

---

### **7. Inadequate Rate Limiting on API Endpoints**
**Description:**
Rate limiting may not be uniformly applied to all critical endpoints, enabling DDoS or brute-force attacks.

**Contribution:**
Rate limiting is mentioned for the API Gateway but lacks details on thresholds or endpoint granularity.

**Example:**
An attacker floods a non-rate-limited endpoint (e.g., database write operations) to exhaust resources.

**Impact:**
Denial of service, resource exhaustion, or data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** Medium
**Current Mitigations:**
- Rate limiting is enabled in the API Gateway.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Apply rate limiting to all critical endpoints** (not just the gateway).
- **Configure adaptive rate limits** based on historical baselines.
```

This analysis focuses on vulnerabilities explicitly tied to the architecture’s design and external dependencies, excluding generic best practices. Critical risks (e.g., API key exposure, unvalidated LLM responses) require immediate attention, while high/medium risks (e.g., database access controls, input validation) should be addressed in subsequent iterations.
