# BUSINESS POSTURE

The "screenshot-to-code" project is an open source tool designed to convert screenshots, mockups, or recorded screen interactions into code through the use of Large Language Model (LLM) APIs. The major business priorities and goals include:

1. Enable fast prototyping of UI elements by automatically generating clean front-end code.
2. Integrate with multiple AI models or image generation services to provide flexibility.
3. Offer both a self-hosted (open source) and a paid/hosted enterprise solution to cater to a wide range of users, from small teams to large enterprises.

From a business perspective, the main benefits are:
- Reduced time to transform design assets into working code.
- Lower overhead for front-end coding of basic or repeated UI patterns.
- Potential to scale and monetize the tool in an enterprise context.

Most important business risks to address:
- Potential unauthorized access or misuse of API keys for LLMs, resulting in unexpected costs or data exposure.
- Reputational risks if the AI-generated code fails to meet certain quality or security expectations.
- Handling of proprietary screenshots or designs that might contain sensitive or IP-protected content.

# SECURITY POSTURE

## Existing Security Controls

security control: Environment variable usage for secrets. The project stores secrets (OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, etc.) in environment variables rather than in code, reducing direct code exposure of secrets.

security control: Dockerized deployment. Docker configuration isolates the application environment, making it simpler to deploy consistently and reducing some classes of misconfiguration.

security control: Minimal data persistence. The project does not persist user-generated screenshots or data at rest by default. Images and code are typically processed in memory or ephemeral containers.

security control: Log-based debugging. The code includes optional debugging functionalities, which can be enabled via environment variables. This centralizes logs and can help in auditing.

## Accepted Risks

accepted risk: Developer-supplied environment variables might be inadvertently exposed if the container or environment is not well-protected. The project currently instructs users to manage these secrets through .env files or environment variables without a robust key management system.

accepted risk: Code snippets or screenshots used for generation are handled in memory and can be stored in logs for debug or auditing. If logs are not suitably protected, sensitive design data could be exposed.

## Recommended Security Controls

- Centralized secret management. Use a secure vault or cloud-managed secret store to handle LLM API keys, rather than relying on .env files.
- Role-based authentication for enterprise usage. Introduce optional user login with role separation, so only authorized individuals can trigger code generation.
- Transport security. Enforce TLS/HTTPS by default on both front-end and back-end to prevent data tampering and eavesdropping.
- Limit inbound connections to the back-end server behind a reverse proxy or WAF, with firewall rules to minimize the attack surface.
- Implement scanning of logs for sensitive data or consider implementing log sanitization to avoid storing confidential or personal data from screenshots.

## Security Requirements

The following high-priority requirements for robust security should be considered:

1. Authentication
   - Provide a mechanism for user authentication and, optionally, Single Sign-On or LDAP integration for enterprise deployments.
2. Authorization
   - If multi-user usage is desired, define user roles (e.g., Admin, Developer) that control who can initiate code generation or see logs.
3. Input Validation
   - Validate incoming requests and ensure user-provided URLs or screenshot data cannot be used for SSRF or injection attacks.
4. Cryptography
   - Encrypt traffic between front-end and back-end (TLS).
   - Ensure safe storage of secrets in an encrypted form or inside a secrets manager.

Where each existing control is implemented or described:
- Environment variable usage is documented in the README and in the Dockerfiles.
- Docker-based deployments are described in docker-compose.yml and the Dockerfiles.
- The codeâ€™s ephemeral data handling is not extensively documented but is implied in the code for image processing (in-memory transformations).

## DEPLOYMENT

The project can be deployed in multiple ways, such as:
- Deploying via Docker Compose on a single host.
- Deploying each container (front-end and back-end) in a Kubernetes cluster.
- Separately deploying front-end as a static site (on Netlify, for example) and back-end on a cloud service.

One common solution is Docker Compose on a single host:

```mermaid

    backendContainer --> externalLLM[OpenAI / Anthropic / etc via Internet]
    frontendContainer --> userBrowser[Developer Browser]

## BUILD

The project is typically built and published through Docker, though local workflows are common as well. An example build pipeline:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    dev(Developer) --> commitCode(Commit to GitHub)
    commitCode --> buildSystem(CI/CD: e.g. GitHub Actions)
    buildSystem --> testPass(Run Tests: Pytest, Lint, SAST)
    testPass --> dockerBuild(Build Docker images for backend/frontend)
    dockerBuild --> pushImages(Push images to container registry)
    pushImages --> deploy(Deploy containers)
```

Build and Security Checks:
- Poetry is used to manage Python dependencies. Developers run poetry install, then run type checks (pyright) and tests (pytest).
- Node environment uses yarn for front-end builds.
- Additional recommended checks:
  - SAST scanners or linters integrated into the pipeline (e.g. GitHub code scanning).
  - Container image scanning to detect vulnerabilities in the base images (e.g. Grype).
  - Automated scans for secret exposures in code or logs.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

What are the critical business processes we are trying to protect?
- The generation of code from proprietary or sensitive design assets, ensuring confidentiality and availability.
- Preservation of API keys to third-party LLM services to avoid misuse or financial losses.

What data are we trying to protect and what is their sensitivity?
- Screenshots, which may include sensitive or proprietary UI designs or personal data. These are usually ephemeral, but if logged or cached, may pose data exposure risks.
- LLM API keys are highly sensitive, as unauthorized use could incur high costs or reveal usage patterns.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

1. Business Posture
- Do we anticipate enterprise customers requiring multi-tenant capabilities or advanced user management?
- Are there budgets or rate limiting set at the LLM provider level to minimize cost overrun risk?

2. Security Posture
- Are logs purged regularly or is encryption at-rest required for any ephemeral data storage?
- Will this system run in an environment that requires compliance frameworks such as SOC 2 or ISO 27001?

3. Design
- Is HTTPS termination handled externally or is the container expected to manage TLS certificates?
- Does the solution need to scale across multiple nodes, or is single-host adequate?

Default assumptions:
- Environment variables are managed securely by the deployment environment or the responsible DevOps team.
- The system is not storing images or user code at rest, so data is ephemeral.
- External LLM calls and screenshot captures are done over secure, reputable APIs with valid keys and adequate rate-limiting in place.
