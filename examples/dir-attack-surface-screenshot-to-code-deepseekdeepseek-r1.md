Here's the updated attack surface analysis integrating findings from the new project files:

### Key Attack Surfaces (Updated)

1. **External CDN Script Inclusion in Generated Code**
   - **Description**: Generated code includes third-party scripts (Tailwind, React, Bootstrap) loaded from external CDNs without integrity checks
   - **Impact**: Compromised CDN could lead to XSS attacks in all generated applications
   - **Risk Severity**: High
   - **Current Mitigations**: None
   - **Missing Mitigations**:
     - Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes for CDN scripts
     - Option to self-host critical libraries
     - User-configurable allowlist for external resources

2. **Unsanitized AI-Generated Code Execution** (Updated)
   - **Description**: Generated code now includes framework-specific vulnerabilities from React/Vue/Ionic components
   - **Impact**: Component-based XSS vulnerabilities could persist in generated code
   - **Risk Severity**: High
   - **Current Mitigations**:
     - Preview rendered in sandboxed iframe (existing)
   - **Missing Mitigations**:
     - Framework-specific sanitization (e.g., React DOM purification)
     - CSP headers blocking unauthorized scripts
     - Automatic vulnerability scanning of generated code

3. **Video Processing Vulnerabilities** (New)
   - **Description**: Video processing using moviepy introduces new attack vectors
   - **Impact**: Malicious video files could exploit vulnerabilities in video processing stack
   - **Risk Severity**: High
   - **Current Mitigations**:
     - Temporary file handling for video processing
   - **Missing Mitigations**:
     - Containerized video processing
     - Strict file type validation
     - FFmpeg sandboxing

4. **AI API Key Exposure** (Existing - No Changes)
   - **Description**: Multiple AI provider keys stored in frontend/backend
   - **Impact**: Key compromise enables API abuse
   - **Risk Severity**: Critical
   - **Current Mitigations**:
     - Keys stored in localStorage and .env
   - **Missing Mitigations**:
     - Key rotation mechanism
     - Usage monitoring

5. **Multi-Model Code Generation Risks** (New)
   - **Description**: Parallel use of Claude/GPT-4/Gemini introduces inconsistent security postures
   - **Impact**: Weakest model security determines overall system vulnerability
   - **Risk Severity**: Medium
   - **Current Mitigations**:
     - Unified output processing
   - **Missing Mitigations**:
     - Model-specific output validation
     - Differential testing across providers
     - Provider-specific sanitization rules

6. **WebSocket Protocol Handling** (New)
   - **Description**: Code generation via WebSockets exposes long-lived connections
   - **Impact**: Potential for DoS attacks through connection exhaustion
   - **Risk Severity**: Medium
   - **Current Mitigations**:
     - FastAPI's default WebSocket implementation
   - **Missing Mitigations**:
     - Connection rate limiting
     - Input size validation
     - Timeout enforcement

### Updated Recommendations by Priority

1. Implement SRI hashes for all CDN resources in generated code
2. Containerize video processing with resource constraints
3. Add model-specific output validation pipelines
4. Enforce WebSocket connection quotas
5. Expand dependency scanning to include video processing stack

The analysis now reflects risks introduced by the expanded framework support, video processing capabilities, and multi-model architecture shown in the project files. Critical risks remain centered around third-party resource trust and AI-generated code execution.
