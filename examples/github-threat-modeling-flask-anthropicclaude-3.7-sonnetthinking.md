# Flask Application Threat Model

## Flask-Specific Security Threats

### 1. Template Injection via Jinja2

- **Description**: Attackers can inject malicious template code if user input is directly included in Jinja2 templates without proper escaping. This allows server-side template injection (SSTI) where attackers can execute arbitrary Python code by inserting template expressions like `{{config}}` or `{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()}}`.

- **Impact**: Remote code execution, data breach, complete system compromise. An attacker could gain full access to the server, exfiltrate sensitive data, or modify application functionality.

- **Affected Flask Component**: Jinja2 template engine integrated with Flask for rendering HTML.

- **Risk Severity**: Critical

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Never use `render_template_string()` with unsanitized user input
  - Always use `|escape` or `|e` filters for variables in templates
  - Use `render_template()` with static template files rather than dynamically generated templates
  - If user-provided templates are necessary, consider Jinja2's SandboxedEnvironment
  - Implement input validation for any data that might be rendered in templates

### 2. Flask Debug Mode in Production

- **Description**: Flask's debug mode enables an interactive debugger with traceback, code inspection, and Python console. If accidentally enabled in production, attackers can view detailed error messages and execute arbitrary code through the interactive debugger.

- **Impact**: Information disclosure exposing application structure, dependencies, and potential vulnerabilities. Remote code execution through the interactive console allowing complete system compromise.

- **Affected Flask Component**: Flask application configuration (`app.run(debug=True)` or environment variable `FLASK_DEBUG=1`).

- **Risk Severity**: Critical

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Explicitly set `debug=False` in production code
  - Use environment variables to control debug settings
  - Implement environment detection to automatically disable debug in production
  - Use a production WSGI server (Gunicorn, uWSGI) instead of Flask's development server
  - Separate development and production configurations

### 3. Insecure Session Cookie Implementation

- **Description**: Flask's default session implementation stores data in client-side cookies. While signed to prevent tampering, cookies aren't encrypted by default. If the SECRET_KEY is weak or compromised, attackers can forge session cookies to impersonate other users.

- **Impact**: Session hijacking, privilege escalation, authentication bypass, exposure of session data stored in cookies.

- **Affected Flask Component**: Flask's session management system (`flask.session`).

- **Risk Severity**: High

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Use a strong, random SECRET_KEY at least 24 characters long
  - Consider server-side session storage with Flask-Session extension
  - Never store sensitive information in session cookies
  - Configure secure, httponly, and samesite cookie flags
  - Set appropriate session lifetime with `PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME`
  - Rotate SECRET_KEY periodically and after any suspected compromise

### 4. Werkzeug Debugger PIN Bypass

- **Description**: Flask's debug mode uses Werkzeug's debugger, which generates a PIN to limit access to the interactive console. Historical vulnerabilities have allowed attackers to bypass or predict this PIN, gaining unauthorized console access.

- **Impact**: Remote code execution if debug mode is enabled, allowing complete system compromise.

- **Affected Flask Component**: Werkzeug debugger used by Flask in debug mode.

- **Risk Severity**: Critical

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Never enable debug mode in production environments
  - Keep Werkzeug updated to the latest version
  - Use proper network security to restrict access to development instances
  - Use a production WSGI server without debug features enabled

### 5. URL Routing Vulnerabilities

- **Description**: Flask's flexible URL routing system can introduce security issues if routes are improperly defined or parameters insufficiently validated. Attackers might exploit path traversal vulnerabilities or inject unexpected values through route parameters.

- **Impact**: Path traversal, unauthorized access to resources, application logic bypass.

- **Affected Flask Component**: Flask's routing system and URL converters (`@app.route`, `url_for()`).

- **Risk Severity**: Medium

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Use appropriate URL converters for route parameters (e.g., `int`, `uuid`)
  - Implement custom converters with strict validation when needed
  - Avoid using route parameters directly in file operations or database queries
  - Use `safe_join` for file path operations related to URL parameters
  - Validate route parameters before use in sensitive operations

### 6. Secret Key Management Issues

- **Description**: Flask uses a SECRET_KEY for signing cookies, sessions, and CSRF tokens. If this key is hardcoded, weak, committed to version control, or reused across environments, it compromises these security features.

- **Impact**: Session forgery, cookie tampering, authentication bypass through manipulated sessions.

- **Affected Flask Component**: Flask application configuration (SECRET_KEY).

- **Risk Severity**: High

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Generate a strong random SECRET_KEY for each environment
  - Store SECRET_KEY securely using environment variables or a secrets manager
  - Never commit SECRET_KEY to version control
  - Implement a process for safe key rotation
  - Use separate keys for development, testing, and production

### 7. JSON Content-Type Security Issues

- **Description**: Flask's handling of JSON requests can introduce security issues. By default, Flask will parse JSON in request bodies even if Content-Type headers don't match, which can bypass CSRF protections that only apply to form submissions.

- **Impact**: CSRF vulnerabilities for JSON endpoints, potential for JSON injection attacks.

- **Affected Flask Component**: Flask's request parsing (`request.json`, `request.get_json()`, `jsonify()`).

- **Risk Severity**: Medium

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Explicitly verify Content-Type headers for JSON endpoints
  - Implement proper JSON schema validation
  - Add CSRF protection for JSON endpoints
  - Use `get_json(force=False, silent=False)` to enforce proper Content-Type
  - Implement JSON content validation before processing

### 8. Cross-Site Request Forgery Protection Absence

- **Description**: Flask doesn't include built-in CSRF protection, requiring developers to implement it manually or use extensions like Flask-WTF. Without explicit implementation, applications are vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

- **Impact**: Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users.

- **Affected Flask Component**: Flask form handling and request processing.

- **Risk Severity**: High

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Use Flask-WTF extension to implement CSRF protection
  - Apply `@csrf.protect` decorators on state-changing routes
  - Ensure proper implementation of CSRF tokens in AJAX requests
  - Verify Origin/Referer headers for sensitive operations
  - Set appropriate CSRF token timeout values

### 9. Flask Default Security Headers Absence

- **Description**: Flask doesn't set important security headers by default (Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options). Without these headers, applications are more vulnerable to XSS, clickjacking, and MIME-type confusion attacks.

- **Impact**: Increased vulnerability to client-side attacks like XSS and clickjacking.

- **Affected Flask Component**: Flask's response mechanism.

- **Risk Severity**: Medium

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Use Flask-Talisman extension to implement security headers
  - Add headers manually using an `@app.after_request` decorator
  - Implement a Content Security Policy appropriate for your application
  - Set X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
  - Configure Referrer-Policy and other security headers based on application needs

### 10. Error Handling Information Disclosure

- **Description**: Flask's default error responses can reveal sensitive information about the application structure and environment if custom error handlers aren't implemented.

- **Impact**: Information disclosure that aids attackers in further exploitation.

- **Affected Flask Component**: Flask's error handling system.

- **Risk Severity**: Medium

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Implement custom error handlers for common HTTP error codes using `@app.errorhandler`
  - Create generic error pages that don't leak implementation details
  - Log detailed errors server-side but return minimal information to users
  - Set up proper exception handling to catch and sanitize error messages

### 11. Flask Extension Misconfiguration Risks

- **Description**: Flask relies heavily on extensions for additional functionality. These extensions may have their own security requirements or vulnerabilities if misconfigured.

- **Impact**: Varies by extension; could include authentication bypass, information disclosure, or even code execution.

- **Affected Flask Component**: Flask's extension system.

- **Risk Severity**: Medium to High (depends on the extension)

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Review security documentation for each extension used
  - Apply security-focused configuration options for extensions
  - Keep extensions updated to their latest versions
  - Test extension configurations as part of security testing
  - Avoid unmaintained or poorly documented extensions

### 12. Static File Serving Vulnerabilities

- **Description**: Flask's built-in static file serving can expose unintended files if misconfigured or if user-supplied input influences file paths.

- **Impact**: Sensitive information disclosure, potential path traversal if combined with other vulnerabilities.

- **Affected Flask Component**: Flask's static file serving and `send_from_directory` function.

- **Risk Severity**: Medium

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Carefully control what files are placed in static directories
  - In production, consider using a dedicated web server or CDN for static content
  - Never use user input directly in `send_from_directory` without validation
  - Set appropriate cache headers and content security headers for static files
  - Use `safe_join` for dynamic file path construction
