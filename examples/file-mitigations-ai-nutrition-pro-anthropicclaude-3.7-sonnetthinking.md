# AI Nutrition-Pro Mitigation Strategies

## 1. Enhanced API Authentication and Authorization

- **Description**:
  - Implement multiple layers of authentication beyond just API keys:
    1. Use short-lived tokens with automatic rotation (max 1-hour validity)
    2. Add IP address restrictions for API access
    3. Implement mutual TLS authentication for highly sensitive operations
    4. Create fine-grained authorization rules based on tenant roles and permissions

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - API key theft (High severity) - Compromised keys have limited usefulness due to short validity and IP restrictions
  - Unauthorized API access (High severity) - Multiple authentication factors significantly reduce unauthorized access risk

- **Impact**:
  - Reduces unauthorized access risk by 80-90% by implementing defense in depth
  - Limits blast radius if credentials are compromised

- **Currently Implemented**:
  - Basic API key authentication at the Kong API Gateway
  - Basic ACL rules for authorization

- **Missing Implementation**:
  - Token rotation mechanism
  - IP-based restrictions
  - Mutual TLS for sensitive operations
  - Granular permission system

## 2. Tenant Data Isolation

- **Description**:
  - Implement strict isolation between different Meal Planner applications:
    1. Add tenant_id as a required field in all database tables
    2. Implement row-level security in API database and Control Plane Database
    3. Create middleware that validates tenant context on every request
    4. Use separate encryption keys for each tenant's sensitive data

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Cross-tenant data access (Critical severity) - Prevents one tenant from accessing another's data
  - Privilege escalation (High severity) - Limits access even if authentication controls are bypassed

- **Impact**:
  - Ensures complete separation between tenants' data even if application logic is flawed
  - Prevents data leakage between different Meal Planner applications

- **Currently Implemented**:
  - Not explicitly mentioned in the architecture document

- **Missing Implementation**:
  - Database schema changes to support tenant isolation
  - Row-level security policies
  - Application-level tenant context validation

## 3. LLM Prompt Security Controls

- **Description**:
  - Create a security layer between the application and ChatGPT:
    1. Develop a library of pre-approved prompt templates with parameterized inputs
    2. Sanitize all user inputs before including in prompts
    3. Implement prompt injection detection
    4. Create an allowlist of acceptable response formats and content types

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Prompt injection attacks (High severity) - Prevents attackers from manipulating the LLM
  - Data leakage via LLM (Medium severity) - Reduces risk of sensitive data being included in prompts
  - Malicious content generation (Medium severity) - Limits what the LLM can generate

- **Impact**:
  - Significantly reduces the attack surface related to LLM integration
  - Prevents malicious use of the AI capabilities

- **Currently Implemented**:
  - No LLM-specific security controls mentioned in the architecture

- **Missing Implementation**:
  - Prompt templates system
  - Input sanitization specific to LLM context
  - Response validation mechanism

## 4. Enhanced Input Validation Framework

- **Description**:
  - Build a comprehensive input validation framework:
    1. Create strict schemas for all API inputs with proper type checking
    2. Implement context-aware validation (e.g., nutritional content validation)
    3. Add sanitization for all inputs that will be used in database queries
    4. Deploy validation at both API Gateway and application levels

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - SQL injection (High severity) - Prevents malicious database queries
  - XSS in stored content (Medium severity) - Sanitizes content that might be displayed in the Meal Planner app
  - Format string attacks (Medium severity) - Ensures proper formatting of all inputs

- **Impact**:
  - Prevents most injection-based attacks
  - Creates multiple layers of defense against malformed inputs

- **Currently Implemented**:
  - Basic "filtering of input" is mentioned at the API Gateway level

- **Missing Implementation**:
  - Application-level validation
  - Context-aware validation specific to nutritional content
  - Comprehensive input sanitization

## 5. API Rate Limiting Enhancement

- **Description**:
  - Implement multi-dimensional rate limiting:
    1. Global rate limits to protect the entire system
    2. Per-tenant limits based on subscription tiers
    3. Per-endpoint limits to prevent abuse of specific functionality
    4. Graduated response to potential abuse (warnings, temporary blocks, permanent blocks)

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Denial of service attacks (Medium severity) - Prevents resource exhaustion
  - Cost inflation attacks (Medium severity) - Prevents excessive billing from OpenAI API usage
  - Brute force attacks (Medium severity) - Limits authentication attempts

- **Impact**:
  - Ensures system availability even under heavy or malicious load
  - Protects against excessive costs from API abuse

- **Currently Implemented**:
  - Basic rate limiting is mentioned at the API Gateway level

- **Missing Implementation**:
  - Tenant-specific rate limits
  - Endpoint-specific protections
  - Cost-based rate limiting for LLM API calls

## 6. Data Minimization for LLM Interactions

- **Description**:
  - Implement a strict data control system for LLM interactions:
    1. Create a process to review and approve what types of data can be sent to ChatGPT
    2. Implement anonymization for all dietitian content samples before sending to the LLM
    3. Remove all personally identifiable information from prompts
    4. Develop a system to audit what data is being sent to the LLM

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Privacy violations (High severity) - Prevents exposure of personal data to third parties
  - Training data poisoning (Medium severity) - Limits what OpenAI could potentially learn from your data
  - Intellectual property leakage (Medium severity) - Protects proprietary nutritional content

- **Impact**:
  - Maintains privacy of dietitian content and end-user data
  - Reduces regulatory and compliance risks

- **Currently Implemented**:
  - No data minimization controls are mentioned in the architecture

- **Missing Implementation**:
  - Data anonymization process
  - PII detection and removal system
  - LLM data audit mechanism

## 7. Database Encryption

- **Description**:
  - Implement comprehensive database encryption:
    1. Enable encryption at rest for both RDS instances
    2. Implement column-level encryption for sensitive data fields
    3. Use separate encryption keys for different data classifications
    4. Implement key rotation policies

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Database data theft (High severity) - Protects data if database backups or storage is compromised
  - Internal data access abuse (Medium severity) - Prevents unauthorized viewing of sensitive data

- **Impact**:
  - Ensures data remains protected even if database storage is compromised
  - Adds protection against insider threats

- **Currently Implemented**:
  - TLS for database connections is mentioned, but no encryption at rest is specified

- **Missing Implementation**:
  - RDS encryption configuration
  - Column-level encryption for sensitive fields
  - Key management system

## 8. Secure Administrator Access Controls

- **Description**:
  - Implement strict controls for administrator access:
    1. Require multi-factor authentication for all admin access
    2. Create approval workflows for sensitive operations
    3. Implement session timeouts and context validation
    4. Create audit trails for all administrative actions
    5. Establish separation of duties for critical functions

- **Threats Mitigated**:
  - Administrator account compromise (High severity) - Limits damage from stolen credentials
  - Insider threats (Medium severity) - Creates accountability and prevents single-person actions
  - Privilege escalation (High severity) - Prevents lateral movement within admin systems

- **Impact**:
  - Significantly reduces the risk of administrator account misuse
  - Creates accountability for all administrative actions

- **Currently Implemented**:
  - Administrator role is mentioned but without specific security controls

- **Missing Implementation**:
  - Multi-factor authentication for admin access
  - Approval workflows
  - Separation of duties
  - Comprehensive audit logging
