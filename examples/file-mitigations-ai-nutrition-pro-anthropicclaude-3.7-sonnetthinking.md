- Adopt least privilege principles for service accounts
- Regularly rotate service credentials

**Threats Mitigated:**
- Lateral movement between services after perimeter breach (High severity)
- Man-in-the-middle attacks on internal communications (Medium severity)
- Unauthorized service-to-service access (Medium severity)

**Impact:**
- Creates strong boundaries between services
- Limits blast radius if one component is compromised
- Ensures only authorized service interactions occur

**Currently Implemented:**
- TLS for communications with databases
- Basic authentication at API Gateway

**Missing Implementation:**
- mTLS between internal services
- Service token authentication
- Role-based access controls for services
- Service credential rotation

## 6. Tenant Isolation Strategy

**Description:**
Implement strong isolation between different Meal Planner application tenants:
- Deploy logical separation of tenant data in databases
- Implement tenant context validation for all API requests

- Prevents one tenant from accessing another tenant's data
- Reduces scope of potential breaches
- Enables compliance with data privacy requirements

**Currently Implemented:**
- The architecture indicates multi-tenant design but doesn't specify isolation mechanisms

**Missing Implementation:**
- Database-level tenant isolation
- Tenant context validation in API requests
