Here is a threat model for the AI Nutrition-Pro application based on the provided architecture description:

- Threat: Compromised API Key
    - Description: An attacker obtains a legitimate Meal Planner application's API key, possibly through client-side leakage, insecure storage, or transmission outside the AI Nutrition-Pro system. The attacker then uses this key to impersonate the legitimate client.
    - Impact: Unauthorized access to the AI Nutrition-Pro API, potentially allowing the attacker to upload malicious samples, fetch content, consume resources (leading to unexpected billing for the legitimate client and increased costs for AI Nutrition-Pro), or interact with the API in ways detrimental to the service or other clients.
    - Affected Component: API Gateway, Backend API, API database.
    - Current Mitigations: Authentication is required using individual API keys for each Meal Planner application. This prevents unauthenticated access.
    - Missing Mitigations: Mechanisms for API key rotation, monitoring for anomalous usage patterns associated with a specific key, and guidance/requirements for Meal Planner applications on secure API key handling are not mentioned.
    - Risk Severity: High

- Threat: Authorization Bypass via API Gateway ACLs
    - Description: An attacker attempts to craft API requests that bypass the intended restrictions defined by the API Gateway's ACL rules. This could involve manipulating request paths, HTTP methods, or headers to access endpoints or data that their compromised API key or tenant configuration should not allow.
    - Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive operations (e.g., managing other tenants' samples, accessing configuration data if any is exposed via the API), unauthorized access to data belonging to other clients, or execution of actions with higher privileges than intended.
    - Affected Component: API Gateway.
    - Current Mitigations: Authorization is enforced using ACL rules at the API Gateway.
    - Missing Mitigations: Rigorous security testing of ACL configurations, adherence to the principle of least privilege when defining ACLs, and potentially more granular authorization logic within the Backend API itself (in addition to the Gateway).
    - Risk Severity: High

- Threat: Prompt Injection / Manipulation via Content Samples or Inputs
    - Description: A malicious actor (potentially a compromised Meal Planner application or a malicious user providing input through a Meal Planner app) injects harmful instructions, biased content, or malicious data into the dietitian content samples or other inputs used to construct prompts for the LLM.
    - How: The attacker crafts the sample text or input data to include instructions that manipulate the LLM's behavior, causing it to generate undesirable, harmful, biased, or off-topic content, or potentially attempt to extract information from the LLM's context or internal prompts.
    - Impact: Generation of harmful or inappropriate content by the AI Nutrition-Pro service, reputational damage, potential leakage of internal system prompts or information if the LLM is susceptible to such attacks, degradation of content quality.
    - Affected Component: Backend API (prompt construction logic), ChatGPT, API database (storing malicious samples/inputs).
    - Current Mitigations: None explicitly mentioned regarding input validation/sanitization for LLM prompts or output filtering for LLM responses.
    - Missing Mitigations: Input validation and sanitization of all data used to construct LLM prompts, output filtering and moderation of LLM responses, using prompt engineering techniques to reduce injection risks, potentially using LLM safety features or guardrails.
    - Risk Severity: High

- Threat: Data Exfiltration from Databases
    - Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to either the Control Plane Database or the API Database. This could occur through compromised credentials (e.g., for the application containers or database users), vulnerabilities in the database software or configuration, or potential injection attacks if application inputs are not properly validated before database interaction.
    - Impact: Theft of sensitive data, including dietitian content samples (potentially proprietary or containing personal info), tenant information, billing data, and stored LLM requests/responses (which may also contain sensitive user input). This can lead to privacy violations, financial loss, and significant reputational damage.
    - Affected Component: Control Plane Database, API database.
    - Current Mitigations: Network traffic to databases is encrypted using TLS.
    - Missing Mitigations: Strong access controls (least privilege) for database users and application containers, network segmentation of databases, regular security patching, input validation to prevent injection vulnerabilities in application code.
    - Risk Severity: Critical

- Threat: Abuse of LLM via Excessive Requests (DoS/Cost Exhaustion)
    - Description: A malicious actor (using a compromised API key or potentially exploiting a flaw to bypass rate limiting) sends an unusually high volume of requests to the Backend API that trigger calls to ChatGPT.
    - How: The attacker floods the API with requests, aiming to incur significant costs for the AI Nutrition-Pro service by excessive LLM usage, exhaust the system's capacity, or potentially hit rate limits imposed by the LLM provider, disrupting service for legitimate users.
    - Impact: Significant unexpected costs for AI Nutrition-Pro due to LLM usage fees, degradation or denial of service for legitimate users, potential blocking or throttling by the external LLM provider.
    - Affected Component: API Gateway, Backend API, ChatGPT.
    - Current Mitigations: Rate limiting is performed by the API Gateway.
    - Missing Mitigations: Granular rate limiting or usage quotas per API key/tenant, monitoring and alerting on abnormal LLM usage patterns, potentially implementing circuit breakers or backpressure mechanisms for LLM calls.
    - Risk Severity: High

- Threat: Compromise of Internal Application Containers (Web Control Plane, Backend API)
    - Description: An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the code or dependencies of the Golang applications running in the Web Control Plane or Backend API containers.
    - How: This could involve exploiting common web vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws if inputs are not validated, broken access control within the application logic itself), vulnerabilities in third-party libraries, or configuration weaknesses. A successful exploit could lead to remote code execution or other severe impacts.
    - Impact: Full compromise of the affected container, potentially allowing the attacker to access sensitive configuration (e.g., database credentials), access the internal network, tamper with application logic, or gain access to the databases.
    - Affected Component: Web Control Plane, Backend API.
    - Current Mitigations: Applications are written in Golang (generally memory-safe, reducing some vulnerability classes). Deployed in AWS ECS (managed environment offers some isolation features).
    - Missing Mitigations: Secure coding practices, comprehensive input validation and sanitization within the application code, regular security scanning (SAST, DAST), dependency vulnerability scanning, principle of least privilege for container roles/permissions, network segmentation between containers.
    - Risk Severity: Critical

- Threat: Manipulation of Configuration or Billing Data via Web Control Plane
    - Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Web Control Plane with sufficient privileges (e.g., compromising an Administrator or Manager account through phishing, weak credentials, or exploiting a vulnerability in the Web Control Plane application) and modifies system configuration or client billing data.
    - How: Accessing the administrative interface and using legitimate functions or exploiting vulnerabilities to alter settings (e.g., pricing models, tenant quotas, feature flags) or billing records.
    - Impact: Financial loss for AI Nutrition-Pro (incorrect billing), service disruption (misconfiguration), unauthorized access or changes affecting other tenants, denial of service (disabling accounts or features).
    - Affected Component: Web Control Plane, Control Plane Database.
    - Current Mitigations: Access to the Web Control Plane requires authentication (Admin role mentioned).
    - Missing Mitigations: Strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., MFA) for administrative users, granular role-based access control (RBAC) within the Web Control Plane, thorough input validation on all administrative functions, comprehensive audit logging of configuration and billing changes.
    - Risk Severity: High

- Threat: Exposure of Sensitive Data Stored in API Database (LLM Requests/Responses)
    - Description: The API Database is explicitly stated to store LLM requests and responses. If users provide sensitive information (e.g., health data, personal details, proprietary business information) as input that is included in the LLM prompt, this sensitive data will be persisted in the database logs.
    - How: Users interact with Meal Planner applications, providing potentially sensitive data that is then passed to AI Nutrition-Pro and included in the prompts sent to ChatGPT. AI Nutrition-Pro stores these prompts and the resulting responses.
    - Impact: A breach of the API Database (see Threat 4) would result in the exposure of this stored sensitive user data, leading to privacy violations, compliance issues (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA depending on data type and region), and loss of user trust.
    - Affected Component: API database.
    - Current Mitigations: TLS for database connections encrypts data in transit.
    - Missing Mitigations: Clear data retention policies for LLM request/response logs, mechanisms to identify and potentially redact or anonymize sensitive information before storage, a clear privacy policy informing users about data storage practices.
    - Risk Severity: High
