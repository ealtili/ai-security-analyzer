Here is the threat model for the AI Nutrition-Pro application, based on the provided architecture description:

- Threat: Compromised Meal Planner Application sending malicious requests
  - Description: An attacker compromises a Meal Planner application and uses its valid API key to send crafted, malicious requests to the AI Nutrition-Pro API Gateway. This could include attempts to bypass authorization, inject malicious payloads, or cause denial of service.
  - Impact: Potential data breach if malicious requests can access or modify sensitive data, service disruption due to denial of service attempts, or generation of harmful or incorrect AI content.
  - Affected component: API Gateway, Backend API, API database.
  - Current mitigations: Authentication with API keys for Meal Planner applications, authorization rules (ACL) in API Gateway, and TLS encryption for network traffic between Meal Planner and API Gateway are in place. These mitigate basic unauthorized access but might not prevent sophisticated attacks using compromised keys.
  - Missing mitigations: Robust input validation and sanitization at the API Gateway and Backend API to filter out malicious payloads. Rate limiting at a more granular level to prevent denial of service from compromised applications. Monitoring and alerting for unusual traffic patterns from Meal Planner applications.
  - Risk severity: High

- Threat: Prompt Injection Attacks via Meal Planner Application
  - Description: An attacker crafts specific input through a Meal Planner application that, when processed by the Backend API and sent to ChatGPT-3.5, manipulates ChatGPT-3.5 into performing unintended actions. This could include bypassing content filters, revealing sensitive information, or generating harmful or biased content.
  - Impact: Generation of inappropriate or harmful content, potential leakage of sensitive data if ChatGPT-3.5 is tricked into revealing information from its training data or internal prompts, reputational damage, and misuse of the LLM service.
  - Affected component: Backend API, ChatGPT-3.5.
  - Current mitigations: Input filtering at API Gateway is mentioned, but its effectiveness against prompt injection is uncertain.
  - Missing mitigations: Implement robust input sanitization and validation in the Backend API specifically designed to mitigate prompt injection attacks before sending requests to ChatGPT-3.5. Content filtering and validation of responses received from ChatGPT-3.5. Consider prompt engineering techniques to minimize susceptibility to injection. Monitoring of ChatGPT-3.5 responses for signs of successful prompt injection.
  - Risk severity: Medium to High (depending on the sensitivity of the application's domain and the potential harm from generated content)

- Threat: API Gateway Authentication or Authorization Bypass
  - Description: An attacker discovers and exploits vulnerabilities in the Kong API Gateway configuration or implementation to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms. This could allow unauthorized access to the Backend API or Web Control Plane without proper credentials.
  - Impact: Full unauthorized access to AI Nutrition-Pro functionality, potential data breaches from both API database and Control Plane database, service disruption, and compromise of the entire application.
  - Affected component: API Gateway, Backend API, Web Control Plane.
  - Current mitigations: Kong API Gateway is used, which provides built-in security features. Authentication and authorization are implemented.
  - Missing mitigations: Regular security audits and penetration testing specifically focused on the API Gateway configuration and rules. Strong configuration management and version control for API Gateway configurations. Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of API Gateway for additional protection.
  - Risk severity: High

- Threat: Web Control Plane Application Vulnerabilities
  - Description: An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Web Control Plane application (e.g., code injection, authentication flaws, insecure deserialization). This could allow unauthorized access to the control plane functionalities, including client management, configuration changes, and billing data access.
  - Impact: Data breach of sensitive control plane data (tenants, billing information), unauthorized modification of system configuration, potential for wider system compromise, and service disruption.
  - Affected component: Web Control Plane, Control Plane Database.
  - Current mitigations: Standard secure development practices for Golang applications and deployment within AWS ECS are assumed.
  - Missing mitigations: Implement regular security code reviews and static/dynamic analysis of the Web Control Plane application. Penetration testing of the Web Control Plane. Implement robust input validation, output encoding, and secure session management. Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for the Web Control Plane.
  - Risk severity: High

- Threat: SQL Injection in Web Control Plane or API Application
  - Description: An attacker exploits SQL injection vulnerabilities in the Web Control Plane or API Application code that interacts with the Control Plane Database or API database respectively. This could allow unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion in the databases.
  - Impact: Data breach of sensitive data in both databases, data integrity issues, potential for data loss or corruption, and service disruption.
  - Affected component: Web Control Plane, Control Plane Database, API Application, API database.
  - Current mitigations: TLS encryption for database connections is in place.
  - Missing mitigations: Enforce secure coding practices, specifically using parameterized queries or an ORM to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities in both Web Control Plane and API Application. Regular static and dynamic code analysis to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities. Database access control and principle of least privilege for application database access.
  - Risk severity: High

- Threat: Administrator Account Compromise or Privilege Abuse
  - Description: An attacker compromises the Administrator account credentials through phishing, credential stuffing, or other means. Alternatively, a malicious insider administrator could abuse their privileges. This grants the attacker full control over the AI Nutrition-Pro application and its infrastructure.
  - Impact: Complete compromise of the AI Nutrition-Pro application, including all data, configurations, and systems. Data breaches, service disruption, system manipulation, and potential for long-term damage.
  - Affected component: All components.
  - Current mitigations: Basic access control for administrator accounts is assumed.
  - Missing mitigations: Implement strong password policies and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrator accounts. Implement the principle of least privilege, even for administrators, where possible. Comprehensive audit logging of all administrator actions. Regular review of administrator access and permissions. Consider using dedicated privileged access management (PAM) solutions.
  - Risk severity: Critical
