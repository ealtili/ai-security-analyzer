## Threat Model for AI Nutrition-Pro Application

### Threat List

- **Threat:** API Key Compromise
  - **Description:** An attacker obtains a valid API key for a Meal Planner application. This could happen through various means such as phishing, malware, or insecure storage of the API key by the Meal Planner application. Once compromised, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate Meal Planner application and make unauthorized requests to the AI Nutrition-Pro API.
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to AI Nutrition-Pro API functionalities, potential data exfiltration from API database (dietitian content samples, LLM requests/responses), misuse of AI services leading to unexpected billing, and potential disruption of service for legitimate Meal Planner applications.
  - **Affected Component:** API Gateway, Meal Planner application interface.
  - **Current Mitigations:** API Key authentication for Meal Planner applications is implemented. This provides a basic level of security by requiring a key for access.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - API Key rotation policies for Meal Planner applications to limit the lifespan of compromised keys.
    - Monitoring and alerting for unusual API key usage patterns (e.g., sudden increase in requests, requests from unusual locations) to detect compromised keys early.
    - Guidance and best practices for Meal Planner application developers on secure API key management and storage.
  - **Risk Severity:** High

- **Threat:** Rate Limiting Bypass
  - **Description:** An attacker attempts to bypass the rate limiting mechanisms implemented in the API Gateway.
