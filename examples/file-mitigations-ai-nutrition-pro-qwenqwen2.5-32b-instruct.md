Here are the mitigation strategies for the AI Nutrition-Pro application based on the architecture and details provided:

### MITIGATION STRATEGIES

1. **Mitigation Strategy: Input Validation and Sanitization**
   - **Description**:
     - Developers should implement robust input validation and sanitization in both the `Web Control Plane` and `API Application` containers to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
     - Ensure that all user inputs are validated against expected formats and sanitized to remove any potentially harmful content.
   - **Threats Mitigated**:
     - **SQL Injection**: High severity. Malicious users can inject SQL commands to manipulate or steal sensitive data.
     - **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: High severity. Malicious users can inject scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
   - **Impact**:
     - Reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to the database and application.
   - **Currently Implemented**:
     - Not explicitly mentioned in the `FILE`.
   - **Missing Implementation**:
     - Input validation and sanitization need to be implemented in both the `Web Control Plane` and `API Application`.

2. **Mitigation Strategy: API Key Rotation and Management**
   - **Description**:

     - Implement a key management system to track and manage the lifecycle of each key.
   - **Threats Mitigated**:
     - **API Key Exposure**: Medium severity. If an API key is exposed, unauthorized users can access the system.
   - **Impact**:
     - Reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential misuse of the system.
   - **Currently Implemented**:
     - Mentioned in the `FILE` that each `Meal Planner` application has an individual API key.
   - **Missing Implementation**:
     - No mention of rotation and management of these keys. Implementation is needed to ensure secure key management.

3. **Mitigation Strategy: Rate Limiting and Throttling**

   - **Threats Mitigated**:
     - **HTTP Response Splitting**: Medium severity. Attackers can inject malicious content in HTTP headers.
     - **Content-Type Sniffing**: Medium severity. Attackers can exploit the browserâ€™s content-type sniffing behavior.
   - **Impact**:
     - Reduces the risk of web-based attacks that can compromise the system.
   - **Currently Implemented**:
     - Not explicitly mentioned in the `FILE`.
   - **Missing Implementation**:
     - Secure configuration of the `API Gateway` is needed.

6. **Mitigation Strategy: Database Access Control**
   - **Description**:
     - Implement strict access control policies for the `Control Plane Database` and `API database`. Ensure that only authorized applications and services can access the databases.
     - Use IAM roles and policies to restrict access to the databases.
   - **Threats Mitigated**:
     - **Unauthorized Database Access**: High severity. Unauthorized users can gain access to sensitive data.
   - **Impact**:
     - Reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to the database.
   - **Currently Implemented**:
     - Not explicitly mentioned in the `FILE`.
   - **Missing Implementation**:
     - Need to implement strict access control policies for the databases.

7. **Mitigation Strategy: Secure Communication between Containers**
   - **Description**:
