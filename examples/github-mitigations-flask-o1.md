- **Mitigation Strategy #1: Securely Load Secrets**
  - **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    - Remove any hard-coded SECRET_KEY (or similar secrets) from the codebase (e.g., config.py).
    - Generate a new random secret and store it in a secure location (such as environment variables or a secure secrets manager).
    - Update the Flask application to load this secret value from the secure source at runtime, ensuring it never appears in plaintext within version control.
  - **List of Threats Mitigated (Severity):**
    - Exposure of sensitive keys (High)
    - Unauthorized access if attackers obtain secret (High)
  - **Impact:**
    - Significantly reduces the likelihood of attackers reusing the stolen secret key to tamper with sessions or impersonate users.
    - Minimizes the risk of secret leakage on publicly accessible repositories or configuration files.
  - **Currently Implemented:**
    - Some references to environment variables exist in the application’s startup script (partial usage in config loading).
  - **Missing Implementation:**
    - A hard-coded SECRET_KEY is still present in config.py; needs removal and replacement with a secure approach.

- **Mitigation Strategy #2: Disable Flask Debug Mode in Production**
  - **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    - Remove or comment out any occurrences of app.run(debug=True) for the production environment.
    - Use conditionals or environment-based flags (e.g., FLASK_ENV) to enable debug mode only in local development.
    - Confirm the production configuration never exposes debug errors or the interactive debugger.
  - **List of Threats Mitigated (Severity):**
    - Exposure of stack traces and internal code details (Medium)
    - Direct access to critical information in debugger console (High)
  - **Impact:**
    - Prevents attackers from obtaining sensitive information (like environment variables or partial code) that could be revealed by the debug interface.
    - Greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized interactive console usage in production.
  - **Currently Implemented:**
    - Debug mode is toggled off in some production deployment scripts, but not enforced consistently.
  - **Missing Implementation:**
    - The code in run.py (or a similar startup file) does not explicitly differentiate between dev and production environments.

- **Mitigation Strategy #3: Enforce Template Autoescaping and Safe Rendering**
  - **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    - Configure Jinja2 (Flask’s default template engine) to enable autoescape for all user-generated content.
    - Explicitly use safe filters such as |e when rendering variables containing user-supplied data.
    - Unless absolutely required, avoid rendering raw HTML content submitted by untrusted sources.
  - **List of Threats Mitigated (Severity):**
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High)
    - HTML injection attacks (Medium)
  - **Impact:**
    - Greatly decreases the chance that malicious scripts embedded by attackers run in other users’ browsers.
  - **Currently Implemented:**
    - Template autoescaping is on by default in some templates, but explicit escapes are inconsistent.
  - **Missing Implementation:**
    - Several routes that render “untrusted” user inputs do not apply safe filters, leaving potential XSS gaps.

- **Mitigation Strategy #4: Minimize Detailed Error Messages**
  - **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    - Replace any verbose error pages or exception dumps with generic error responses when in production mode.
    - Configure custom Flask error handlers for important HTTP status codes (e.g., 404, 500) to control the messages returned to users.
    - Store detailed error logs separately, ensuring they aren’t exposed in production routes.
  - **List of Threats Mitigated (Severity):**
    - Information Disclosure (Medium)
    - Potential use of error details for further exploitation (Medium)
  - **Impact:**
    - Reduces the ability of attackers to learn about internal code structure, server paths, or configuration details.
  - **Currently Implemented:**
    - Some routes handle exceptions gracefully and return custom 404 or 500 pages.
  - **Missing Implementation:**
    - A few modules still return stack traces by default if unhandled exceptions occur.

- **Mitigation Strategy #5: Use Server-Side Retrieval for Sensitive Identifiers**
  - **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    - Replace direct reliance on user-submitted IDs or tokens with server-side lookups using the Flask session.
    - On login, store a verified user ID in the session and retrieve it internally on subsequent requests.
    - Validate session tokens and confirm ownership of resources before granting access to critical operations.
  - **List of Threats Mitigated (Severity):**
    - Session Hijacking or Replay (High)
    - User Impersonation (High)
  - **Impact:**
    - Dramatically reduces the opportunity for attackers to craft requests using forged or stolen identifiers.
    - Ensures the application consistently identifies the correct user context.
  - **Currently Implemented:**
    - Session-based authentication appears in some routes, but certain user-related actions still rely on ID parameters in the request.
  - **Missing Implementation:**
    - No forced identity verification via session for specific critical routes (e.g., resource deletion).
