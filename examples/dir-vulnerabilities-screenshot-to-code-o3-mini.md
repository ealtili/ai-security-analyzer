- **Vulnerability Name:** Unauthenticated and Rate‑Limit‑Free WebSocket Code Generation Abuse
  - **Description:**
    - The `/generate-code` WebSocket endpoint (in `routes/generate_code.py`) accepts JSON parameters from any client without requiring authentication or rate limiting.
    - An attacker can connect repeatedly (or keep multiple connections open) and send prompts that trigger expensive third‑party LLM calls (e.g., to GPT‑4 or Anthropic models).
    - Such abuse would cause significant financial and resource consumption on the backend.
  - **Impact:**
    - Severe financial cost escalation (since expensive API calls are triggered on demand).
    - Denial of service (DoS) potential as resources are consumed by multiple requests.
    - Overall service disruption and potential abuse of third‑party API quotas.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - There is no authentication, authorization, or rate‑limiting applied at the WebSocket endpoint.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement user authentication (or API keys tied to individual users).
    - Add strict rate‑limiting (per IP and/or per account).
    - Enforce robust input validation on prompt parameters.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The publicly accessible server instance exposes the `/generate-code` endpoint over WebSocket.
    - An attacker has network access to the server and can mimic valid client parameters.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `backend/main.py`, the CORSMiddleware is set to allow all origins and no protection is added for endpoints.
    - In `routes/generate_code.py`, the `@router.websocket("/generate-code")` function immediately accepts the connection and reads parameters from the client—these parameters (including API keys) are then used to build prompts that call expensive external models.
    - No check is performed on how many requests or how often they’re sent.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    - Use a WebSocket client (using a tool like websocat or a custom script) to connect to `ws://<server>:<port>/generate-code`.
    - Send valid JSON parameters (even using test/dummy API keys if available) to trigger code generation.
    - Rapidly (or in parallel) send repeated “Next” or generation requests and monitor that the responses are coming back, while observing that no authentication block or rate limit is enforced.
    - Measure resource utilization and note any abnormal cost or slowdown.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Disclosure in Evaluation Endpoints
  - **Description:**
    - Several endpoints (such as `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, and `/best-of-n-evals` in `routes/evals.py`) accept a folder path supplied via query parameters without sanitization.
    - An attacker can supply arbitrary (or traversal) paths (e.g. `folder=../../secret`) that cause the server to list files or return file contents from unintended directories.
  - **Impact:**
    - Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive server–side files and directory listings.
    - Information leakage that might lead to further system compromise.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The code performs only a basic existence check (using `os.path.exists`) and then calls `os.listdir` on the provided folder.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization and path normalization should be applied.
    - The application should restrict folder paths to a fixed “evals input” directory (a whitelist).
    - Authentication controls are needed to prevent arbitrary access.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The evaluation endpoints are publicly exposed and accept a ‘folder’ query parameter.
    - The server process has read permissions on sensitive directories accessible by an attacker.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `routes/evals.py`, the endpoint for GET `/evals` immediately converts the user‑supplied folder into a `Path` and calls `os.listdir`, then later reads files without enforcing an allowed directory boundary.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    - Use an HTTP client (such as curl or Postman) to send a GET request to `/evals?folder=../../` or another relative path.
    - Verify if the response includes files or directories that should be hidden.
    - Confirm that sensitive files can be enumerated or viewed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** CORS Misconfiguration Allowing Wildcard with Credentials
  - **Description:**
    - The backend configuration (in `main.py`) adds CORSMiddleware with `allow_origins=["*"]` and also sets `allow_credentials=True`.
    - According to security best practices, when credentials (cookies, authorization headers) are sent, the server should restrict origins to a safe whitelist.
    - This misconfiguration may allow a malicious website to perform cross‑site requests that include credentials.
  - **Impact:**
    - Possibility of cross‑site request forgery (CSRF) attacks if sensitive API responses are accessible.
    - Unauthorized use of endpoints from an attacker–controlled origin.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - No mitigation exists; the current settings use the wildcard for origins together with credentials.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Limit the allowed origins to a trusted whitelist.
    - Set `allow_credentials` to false if public access is intended.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - A browser accessing the API can send cookies or other credentials to the API endpoint from any untrusted origin.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `backend/main.py` the CORSMiddleware is added with the configuration:
      ```python
      app.add_middleware(
          CORSMiddleware,
          allow_origins=["*"],
          allow_credentials=True,
          allow_methods=["*"],
          allow_headers=["*"],
      )
      ```
    - This combination is not recommended when sensitive operations are available.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    - Create a simple malicious HTML/JavaScript page hosted on an untrusted domain that attempts to send an AJAX request (with credentials enabled) to one of the API endpoints.
    - Verify via browser developer tools that the request succeeds and cookies are sent.
    - Demonstrate the improper cross‑origin sharing.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insufficient Input Validation in the Screenshot API (Potential SSRF)
  - **Description:**
    - The `/api/screenshot` endpoint (in `routes/screenshot.py`) accepts a JSON request containing a URL.
    - The provided URL is then forwarded as a request parameter to an external screenshot service without adequate validation or filtering.
    - Although the call is made to the external API, an attacker might attempt to supply an internal IP (e.g. 127.0.0.1 or localhost) or other malicious URLs to probe internal resources or cause abuse.
  - **Impact:**
    - If exploited, could lead to server‑side request forgery (SSRF) against internal networks.
    - May also open avenues for phishing or cause unintended side‑effects on the external screenshot service.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - There is no explicit validation of the `url` field in `ScreenshotRequest` before it’s passed along.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Enforce strict validation of the provided URL (e.g. checking for proper URL schema such as http/https, disallowing localhost or internal IP ranges).
    - Optionally restrict access only to pre‑approved external domains.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The publicly accessible API accepts arbitrary URL values without filtering.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `routes/screenshot.py`, the function `capture_screenshot` uses the user‑supplied `target_url` in building the query parameters for the external service call.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    - Craft a POST request to `/api/screenshot` with a JSON body in which `"url"` is set to an internal IP address (e.g. `"http://127.0.0.1"`).
    - Observe whether the backend forwards this URL to the external API and if any screenshot or error message is returned, confirming the lack of validation.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Lack of Authentication and Authorization on Sensitive Endpoints
  - **Description:**
    - Many endpoints—including `/generate-code`, various evaluation endpoints (`/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, and `/best-of-n-evals`)—are not protected by any authentication or authorization mechanism.
    - This means that any client (including an attacker) may access, trigger, or manipulate these endpoints without any checks.
  - **Impact:**
    - Unauthorized users can trigger costly LLM API calls (with potential for financial damage), view internal evaluation data (information disclosure), and interfere with application logic.
    - The absence of authentication also makes it easier for attackers to abuse these endpoints systematically.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The application is built as an open service; no login or API key validation is performed on these sensitive endpoints.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Introduce robust authentication (e.g. OAuth, JWT, or API tokens) for sensitive endpoints.
    - Limit access to administrative or authorized users only.
    - Apply authorization checks to ensure that only valid requests are processed.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The server is publicly accessible and does not enforce any user-level authentication.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - A review of all route files in `routes/` (including `generate_code.py`, `evals.py`, etc.) shows that no authentication middleware or checks are performed on incoming requests.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    - Use an HTTP client (such as Postman, curl, or a custom script) to issue GET and POST requests to endpoints like `/evals` and `/generate-code` without providing any authentication credentials.
    - Verify that the endpoints respond with full data and execute all operations normally.
    - Attempt to abuse the endpoint by sending many requests and confirm that the system does not block or restrict these actions.

Each of these vulnerabilities poses a serious real‑world risk if the publicly available instance of the application is abused by external attackers. Addressing these issues by applying authentication, rate limiting, strict input validation, proper CORS configuration, and path sanitization is crucial to harden the application against potential exploitation.
