### Attack Surface Analysis for screenshot-to-code

- **Attack Surface: API Key Exposure**
  - Description: API keys for accessing AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate) are required for the application to function. If these keys are compromised, attackers can incur costs, disrupt services, or potentially access sensitive data through the AI provider APIs.
  - How screenshot-to-code contributes to the attack surface: The application requires users to provide and manage their own API keys. Instructions encourage storing keys in `.env` files for local development and browser local storage for the application itself. The `backend/routes/generate_code.py` file retrieves these keys from environment variables or client-side settings.
  - Example: A developer accidentally commits a `.env` file containing API keys to a public GitHub repository. An attacker finds the keys and uses them to make unauthorized requests to the AI APIs.
  - Impact: Financial costs due to unauthorized API usage, disruption of service, potential exposure of data processed by the AI models if used maliciously.
  - Risk Severity: High
  - Current Mitigations: The application stores API keys in browser local storage, explicitly stating "Never stored on our servers" in `Troubleshooting.md`. This mitigates server-side key compromise for the hosted version.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - For local development, strongly discourage the use of `.env` files and recommend using environment variables, with clear instructions on secure handling and avoiding commits to version control.
    - For both local and hosted versions, provide guidance on securely obtaining and managing API keys, emphasizing the risks of exposure.
    - For enterprise plans, consider offering or recommending more robust secrets management solutions.

- **Attack Surface: Client-Side Storage Vulnerability**
  - Description: Storing API keys and potentially other sensitive data in browser local storage makes them vulnerable to client-side attacks, particularly Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
  - How screenshot-to-code contributes to the attack surface: The application design relies on browser local storage for persisting API keys and potentially user settings. The `backend/routes/generate_code.py` file retrieves API keys that might be stored in local storage.
  - Example: An XSS vulnerability is introduced in the frontend code. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to execute malicious JavaScript in a user's browser, stealing the API keys stored in local storage.
  - Impact: Unauthorized access to AI services using stolen API keys, potential data breaches if other sensitive user data is stored client-side and compromised.
  - Risk Severity: Medium
  - Current Mitigations: The project description acknowledges client-side storage but does not include explicit mitigations against client-side vulnerabilities in the provided files.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust input validation and output encoding across the frontend application to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the frontend to identify and remediate potential XSS vulnerabilities.
    - If storing sensitive user data client-side becomes necessary, evaluate more secure client-side storage options or encryption methods.

- **Attack Surface: Evaluation Data Exposure**
  - Description: The application includes evaluation datasets (screenshots and potentially expected outputs) in the `backend/evals_data` directory. If these datasets contain sensitive or proprietary information and are inadvertently exposed, it could lead to data leaks.
  - How screenshot-to-code contributes to the attack surface: The project includes evaluation data within the codebase and accessible in the repository. The `backend/routes/evals.py` file reads and processes files from directories, including those under `EVALS_DIR`.
  - Example: The evaluation dataset includes screenshots of internal dashboards or proprietary UI designs. If the repository becomes publicly accessible or is compromised, this data could be leaked.
  - Impact: Exposure of proprietary designs, sensitive testing data, or internal application details.
  - Risk Severity: Medium
  - Current Mitigations: No explicit mitigations are mentioned in the provided files regarding the security of evaluation data.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Review the evaluation datasets to ensure they do not contain any sensitive or confidential information. Use anonymized or synthetic data where possible.
    - Restrict access to the evaluation datasets, especially in production deployments and consider removing them from production builds if not required.
    - If sensitive evaluation data is necessary, store it securely outside the application repository and manage access controls appropriately.

- **Attack Surface: Docker Image Vulnerabilities**
  - Description: The Docker images used for building and deploying the application (defined in `backend/Dockerfile` and `frontend/Dockerfile`) may contain vulnerabilities present in the base images or installed dependencies.
  - How screenshot-to-code contributes to the attack surface: Docker is used for containerization and deployment, inheriting the inherent risks of container image vulnerabilities.
  - Example: A known vulnerability exists in the `node:22-bullseye-slim` base image used for the frontend. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the running frontend container.
  - Impact: Container compromise, potentially leading to further host system compromise or service disruption.
  - Risk Severity: Medium
  - Current Mitigations: Standard Docker security practices are implicitly assumed but not explicitly configured or mentioned in the provided Dockerfiles.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement a process for regularly scanning Docker images for vulnerabilities using tools like vulnerability scanners.
    - Choose minimal and regularly updated base images for Dockerfiles.
    - Keep dependencies within Docker images updated to their latest secure versions.
    - Follow Docker security best practices, such as using least privilege principles for container processes and applying security profiles.

- **Attack Surface: Backend Dependency Vulnerabilities**
  - Description: The backend application relies on numerous Python dependencies listed in `backend/pyproject.toml`. These dependencies may contain known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
  - How screenshot-to-code contributes to the attack surface: The application's functionality is directly dependent on these external libraries. Files like `backend/routes/evals.py` and `backend/routes/generate_code.py` import and use various libraries.
  - Example: A critical vulnerability is discovered in the `fastapi` or `openai` library. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to compromise the backend server.
  - Impact: Backend server compromise, potential data breaches, service disruption, and unauthorized access to application functionalities.
  - Risk Severity: Medium to High
  - Current Mitigations: The project uses Poetry for dependency management, which aids in version control and dependency resolution. However, it does not inherently prevent or mitigate dependency vulnerabilities.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement regular dependency scanning using tools like `poetry audit` or dedicated vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    - Establish a policy and process for promptly updating vulnerable dependencies.
    - Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to the project's dependencies.

- **Attack Surface: Debug Mode Exposure**
  - Description: The backend configuration (`backend/config.py`) includes debug flags (`IS_DEBUG_ENABLED`, `SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE`). If debug mode is unintentionally enabled in production, it could expose sensitive information, bypass security checks, or introduce unintended functionalities.
  - How screenshot-to-code contributes to the attack surface: The application provides configuration options to enable debug features. `backend/routes/generate_code.py` checks `SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE` to use mock completions.
  - Example: The `MOCK=true` environment variable is accidentally set in a production deployment, causing the backend to use mock AI responses, potentially bypassing intended security or rate limiting mechanisms and leading to inconsistent behavior. Enabling `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` in production could expose verbose logs or debugging endpoints.
  - Impact: Information disclosure through verbose error messages or debug logs, potential bypass of security controls, inconsistent application behavior.
  - Risk Severity: Medium
  - Current Mitigations: The configuration file exists, but there are no explicit controls or safeguards mentioned in the provided files to prevent debug mode exposure in production.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Strictly enforce disabling debug mode in production environments.
    - Implement environment-specific configurations to ensure debug flags are always set to `False` in production.
    - Add runtime checks to prevent debug mode from being enabled in production deployments.
    - Clearly document the security implications of enabling debug mode and restrict its use to development and testing environments only.

- **Attack Surface: Backend Code Vulnerabilities (General)**
  - Description: The backend application code may contain various software vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, insecure deserialization, authentication or authorization bypasses, or business logic flaws.
  - How screenshot-to-code contributes to the attack surface: The backend code handles user requests, processes images, interacts with AI APIs, and generates code, all of which are potential areas for vulnerabilities. Files like `backend/routes/evals.py`, `backend/routes/generate_code.py`, and `backend/routes/screenshot.py` handle user inputs and perform backend logic.
  - Example: An SQL injection vulnerability in a future database interaction (not evident in provided files but a general backend risk). A path traversal vulnerability in file handling if the application were to process user-uploaded files directly.
  - Impact: Full backend server compromise, data breaches, unauthorized access to application functionality, service disruption.
  - Risk Severity: High to Critical
  - Current Mitigations: The project includes type checking (`pyright`) and unit tests (`pytest`) as mentioned in `backend/README.md`, which are positive development practices but do not guarantee the absence of security vulnerabilities.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Conduct thorough code reviews, focusing on security aspects, especially for code handling user inputs, API interactions, and core application logic.
    - Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools in the development pipeline to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities.
    - Follow secure coding practices throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), including input validation, output sanitization, and principle of least privilege.

- **Attack Surface: AI Model Vulnerabilities and Misuse**
  - Description: The application relies on external AI models from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and Replicate. These models themselves or the way the application interacts with them could introduce vulnerabilities or risks of misuse.
  - How screenshot-to-code contributes to the attack surface: The core functionality depends on integrating with and utilizing external AI models for code generation and image processing. `backend/routes/generate_code.py` handles interactions with different AI models.
  - Example: A prompt injection attack is crafted by a user, causing the AI model to generate malicious code or leak sensitive information. The AI model hallucinates and generates code with security flaws or backdoors. Rate limiting on AI APIs is insufficient, leading to denial-of-service or unexpected costs.
  - Impact: Generation of vulnerable or malicious code, potential misuse of AI services leading to unexpected costs or service disruption, information leakage through AI model responses.
  - Risk Severity: Medium
  - Current Mitigations: The application uses multiple AI models, potentially diversifying risk, and allows users to select models. However, there are no explicit mitigations in place for AI model-specific vulnerabilities or misuse in the provided files.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust prompt engineering techniques to mitigate prompt injection attacks and control AI model behavior.
    - Monitor AI model outputs for unexpected or potentially malicious code patterns and implement filters or validation mechanisms.
    - Implement rate limiting and usage monitoring for AI APIs to prevent abuse and manage costs.
    - Educate users about the limitations and potential security risks associated with AI-generated code and encourage manual review and security checks of the generated output.

- **Attack Surface: Path Traversal in Evaluation Endpoints**
  - Description: The evaluation endpoints in `backend/routes/evals.py` (`/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, `/best-of-n-evals`) take user-provided folder paths as input. Insufficient validation of these paths could allow attackers to access files outside the intended evaluation directories.
  - How screenshot-to-code contributes to the attack surface: The application exposes endpoints that directly use user-provided folder paths to read files.
  - Example: An attacker provides a folder path like `/../../etc/passwd` to the `/evals` endpoint. If path validation is missing, the application might attempt to read `/etc/passwd`, leading to unauthorized file access.
  - Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server, information disclosure.
  - Risk Severity: Medium to High
  - Current Mitigations: The code checks if the provided folder exists using `os.path.exists()`, but it doesn't sanitize or validate the path to prevent traversal beyond intended directories.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust path validation and sanitization for the `folder` parameters in `/evals.py` endpoints.
    - Use secure path handling functions to prevent traversal outside of allowed directories.
    - Consider using relative paths or whitelisting allowed base directories for evaluations.

- **Attack Surface: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Screenshot Endpoint**
  - Description: The `/api/screenshot` endpoint in `backend/routes/screenshot.py` takes a `target_url` as input and uses an external service (`screenshotone.com`) to capture a screenshot. If the application doesn't properly validate the `target_url`, an attacker could potentially abuse this endpoint to perform SSRF attacks.
  - How screenshot-to-code contributes to the attack surface: The application provides a functionality to take screenshots of arbitrary URLs provided by the user.
  - Example: An attacker provides a `target_url` pointing to an internal service or a cloud metadata endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/internal-admin` or `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data`). The backend server will make a request to this URL using `screenshotone.com`, potentially exposing internal resources or sensitive information.
  - Impact: Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further exploitation depending on the internal services exposed.
  - Risk Severity: Medium
  - Current Mitigations: The code uses `httpx` to make requests to `screenshotone.com`, but there is no explicit validation of the `target_url` to prevent SSRF.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement strict validation and sanitization of the `target_url` in the `/api/screenshot` endpoint.
    - Use a URL parsing library to validate the URL scheme (e.g., only allow `http` and `https`), hostname, and path.
    - Consider using a blocklist to prevent requests to internal networks or sensitive IP ranges.
    - Implement rate limiting for the screenshot endpoint to mitigate potential abuse.
