### Mitigation Strategies for screenshot-to-code Project

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Secure API Key Management
    - **Description**:
        1. Store API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate, ScreenshotOne) as environment variables on the server-side backend, as shown in the `README.md` and `config.py`.  This prevents hardcoding keys in the application code.
        2.  For local development and self-hosting, instruct users to set up `.env` files as described in `README.md` and ensure `.env` files are not committed to version control (already a standard practice but worth reiterating in documentation).
        3.  For the hosted version, securely manage API keys within the hosting environment, utilizing secure vault or secrets management systems.
        4.  In the frontend settings dialog (mentioned in `README.md`), if API keys are stored in the browser (e.g., localStorage), clearly inform users about the security implications of storing sensitive keys in the browser and that these keys are stored client-side only and never transmitted to the server. Emphasize that this is less secure than server-side management for sensitive use cases.
        5.  Specifically for the ScreenshotOne API key used in `screenshot.py`, ensure it is also managed as an environment variable and not hardcoded.
    - **Threats Mitigated**:
        - API Key Exposure (High Severity): Unauthorized access and usage of LLM APIs and ScreenshotOne API, leading to financial charges, service disruption, and potential data breaches if keys are misused.
    - **Impact**:
        - Significantly reduces the risk of API key exposure by separating keys from the codebase and using environment variables or secure vaults. Client-side storage option remains for convenience but with clear security warnings.
    - **Currently Implemented**:
        - Backend: Yes, `.env` file usage is documented in `README.md` and keys are read from environment variables in `config.py`. Files like `run_image_generation_evals.py`, `video_to_app.py`, and now `generate_code.py` and implicitly `screenshot.py` demonstrate the usage of environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`).
        - Frontend: Settings dialog for key input exists, as mentioned in `Troubleshooting.md`. Browser-side storage is implied by the documentation stating "Your key is only stored in your browser. Never stored on our servers." in `Troubleshooting.md`.
    - **Missing Implementation**:
        - Documentation: Enhance documentation in `README.md` and `Troubleshooting.md` with more explicit warnings about the risks of client-side API key storage and best practices for server-side key management for self-hosted instances and the hosted version. Include guidance on securely managing Replicate, Gemini and ScreenshotOne API keys as well, given the use of Replicate API in `run_image_generation_evals.py` and `image_generation/replicate.py`, Gemini API in `generate_code.py` and ScreenshotOne API in `screenshot.py`.
        - Hosted Version:  Describe the secure API key management practices implemented in the hosted version's infrastructure.

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Input Validation and Sanitization for Model Parameters
    - **Description**:
        1. Although the primary input is an image or video, the application also takes parameters such as model selection, stack selection, input mode, and generation type via WebSocket messages in `generate_code.py`. Validate these inputs on the backend (specifically within the WebSocket endpoint and `extract_params` function in `generate_code.py`) to ensure they are within expected values and formats.
        2.  While prompt injection is less direct with image/video inputs, sanitize any text-based parameters or instructions that are incorporated into the prompts sent to the LLMs. This helps prevent malicious users from manipulating the LLM's behavior through indirect text-based inputs.
        3. Ensure image processing libraries used (like Pillow, mentioned implicitly by `PIL` usage in `image_processing/utils.py` and explicitly in `video/utils.py`) and video processing libraries (`moviepy` in `video/utils.py`) are kept up-to-date to mitigate any known processing vulnerabilities that could be exploited through crafted images or videos.
        4.  Validate the `stack`, `inputMode`, and `generationType` parameters extracted in `extract_params` function within `generate_code.py` to ensure only allowed values (defined in `backend\prompts\types.py` and used in prompt creation logic) are processed. This prevents unexpected behavior if invalid parameters are requested.  Use type checking and enumeration validation to enforce allowed values for these parameters.
    - **Threats Mitigated**:
        - Prompt Injection (Medium Severity): Although less likely with image/video inputs, malicious users might find ways to manipulate LLM behavior through carefully crafted images/videos or by exploiting vulnerabilities in image/video processing if text prompts are introduced or parameters are manipulated.
        - Parameter Tampering (Medium Severity):  Users could try to send unexpected or malicious values for model parameters via WebSocket, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.
        - Image/Video Processing Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity): Exploiting vulnerabilities in image/video processing libraries could lead to various attacks, including denial of service or even remote code execution.
    - **Impact**:
        - Reduces the risk of unintended or malicious LLM behavior caused by manipulated inputs. Enhances robustness against unexpected input. Protects against potential vulnerabilities in media processing.
    - **Currently Implemented**:
        - Partially.  `extract_params` function in `generate_code.py` performs some validation on `generatedCodeConfig` (stack), `inputMode`, and `generationType`. Type casting and checking against allowed values using `get_args` is present.
    - **Missing Implementation**:
        - Backend: Enhance input validation and sanitization in the `extract_params` function in `generate_code.py` for all parameters received from the frontend via WebSocket.  Explicitly validate against allowed `Stack` and `InputMode` values using enums or predefined lists. Add validation for other parameters if more are introduced in the future.
        - Image/Video Processing:  Establish a process to regularly update image and video processing libraries and monitor for security advisories.  Given the image processing in `image_processing/utils.py` and video processing in `video/utils.py`, ensure that `PIL`, `moviepy` and other media processing dependencies are part of the dependency update process (Mitigation Strategy: Regularly Update Dependencies and Monitor for Vulnerabilities).

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Transparency and User Education on Data Handling and Privacy
    - **Description**:
        1.  Clearly communicate in a privacy policy (if the project collects user data, even temporarily) and in the application's documentation how user screenshots and videos are handled, whether they are transmitted to third-party LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Replicate, ScreenshotOne), and if so, for what purpose.
        2.  Inform users if any data (screenshots, videos, generated code, or API keys - if client-side storage is used) is stored, where it is stored, for how long, and under what security measures.
        3.  In the `README.md` or a dedicated security section, address data privacy concerns related to using third-party LLM APIs and the ScreenshotOne API. Explain that screenshots and videos are processed by these APIs to generate code and images.
        4.  For the hosted version, provide a privacy policy that outlines data handling practices clearly.
        5.  Consider the implications of logging user prompts and completions as seen in `fs_logging/core.py`. If logging is enabled, document the purpose of logs, what data is logged, and how logs are secured and managed, especially concerning user data.  Also consider if video data or screenshots are logged and the privacy implications.
    - **Threats Mitigated**:
        - Data Privacy Violation (Medium to High Severity): User screenshots and videos may contain sensitive information. Lack of transparency about data handling can lead to privacy violations and reputational damage.
    - **Impact**:
        - Increases user trust by being transparent about data handling practices. Helps users make informed decisions about using the application, especially with sensitive data. Can also help with compliance with data privacy regulations.
    - **Currently Implemented**:
        - Partially. The `Troubleshooting.md` mentions "Your key is only stored in your browser. Never stored on our servers." indicating awareness of client-side data handling for API keys.
    - **Missing Implementation**:
        - Documentation: Create a clear privacy policy document and/or a security section in `README.md` or a dedicated SECURITY.md file detailing data handling practices for screenshots, videos, generated code, and API keys (for both self-hosted and hosted versions). Explicitly mention the involvement of third-party APIs like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate, and ScreenshotOne. Address data logging practices related to `fs_logging/core.py`, and clarify if screenshots or video data are logged.
        - Application UI:  Consider adding a link to the privacy policy in the application's UI (e.g., in the settings dialog or footer).

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Implement Rate Limiting and Monitoring for API Usage
    - **Description**:
        1.  Implement rate limiting on the backend (especially in `generate_code.py` and `screenshot.py` routes) to control the frequency of requests sent to LLM APIs, image generation APIs, and the ScreenshotOne API. This prevents abuse, accidental over-usage, and helps manage costs for all external APIs.
        2.  For the self-hosted version, provide guidance on how users can implement their own rate limiting or monitor API usage to manage their API costs, as overuse can lead to unexpected expenses. This is crucial given the multiple API dependencies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate, ScreenshotOne) demonstrated in files like `evals/core.py`, `image_generation/core.py`, `run_image_generation_evals.py`, `generate_code.py`, and `screenshot.py`.
        3.  Monitor API usage and error rates on the backend to detect anomalies or potential issues for all APIs including ScreenshotOne.
    - **Threats Mitigated**:
        - API Rate Limiting and Cost Exhaustion (Medium Severity):  Uncontrolled API usage can lead to hitting rate limits imposed by LLM providers and ScreenshotOne, service disruptions, and unexpected financial charges for users.
        - API Abuse (Medium Severity): Prevents malicious users from excessively using the APIs, potentially leading to service disruptions or increased costs.
        - Denial of Service (Low to Medium Severity): In extreme cases of abuse, lack of rate limiting could potentially contribute to a denial-of-service scenario for the application's backend or the user's API access.
    - **Impact**:
        - Improves the stability and reliability of the service by preventing overload and abuse of all APIs. Helps users manage API costs and avoid service disruptions due to rate limits.
    - **Currently Implemented**:
        - Not explicitly seen in the provided files. `mock_llm.py` simulates LLM responses without actual API calls, so rate limiting is not relevant for mock usage, reinforcing that it's needed for production API calls.
    - **Missing Implementation**:
        - Backend: Implement rate limiting logic in the backend (FastAPI) for API calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate, and ScreenshotOne. Consider using libraries like `fastapi-limiter`.  This should cover code generation APIs (used in `evals/core.py` and `generate_code.py`), image generation APIs (used in `image_generation/core.py` and `run_image_generation_evals.py` and potentially within `generate_code.py`), and ScreenshotOne API (used in `screenshot.py`).
        - Monitoring: Integrate basic API usage monitoring in the backend to track request counts and error rates for all external APIs.
        - Documentation:  Document rate limiting measures and provide guidance to self-hosted users on managing API usage and costs for all APIs.

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Regularly Update Dependencies and Monitor for Vulnerabilities
    - **Description**:
        1.  Establish a process for regularly updating both backend (Python - `poetry`) and frontend (Node.js - `yarn`) dependencies. This is a general security best practice but crucial to address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries, including those used for interacting with LLM APIs, ScreenshotOne API, or for image and video processing. This is further emphasized by the usage of `PIL` in `image_processing/utils.py` and `video/utils.py`, and `moviepy` in `video/utils.py`.
        2.  Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk, or integrated features in GitHub) to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
        3.  Monitor security advisories for Python and Node.js ecosystems and promptly update libraries when vulnerabilities are announced, especially for dependencies directly related to API interactions, image/video handling, and web framework components.
    - **Threats Mitigated**:
        - Dependency Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity): Using outdated dependencies with known security vulnerabilities can expose the application to various attacks, including remote code execution, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other exploits. Vulnerabilities in image/video processing libraries could be exploited.
    - **Impact**:
        - Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation via known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. Maintains a secure and up-to-date software base.
    - **Currently Implemented**:
        - Yes, dependency management is in place using `poetry` for backend and `yarn` for frontend, as indicated by `pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`, `package.json`, and `yarn.lock`. Dockerfiles also specify versions, suggesting version control of dependencies.
    - **Missing Implementation**:
        - Automated Dependency Scanning: Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning using tools like Dependabot or GitHub's security features. Set up alerts for vulnerability detections and a process for timely updates.
        - Update Process: Document a clear process for regularly reviewing and updating dependencies, especially after security advisories are released for libraries in use. This process should explicitly include image processing libraries like `PIL`, and video processing libraries like `moviepy` due to their usage as seen in `image_processing/utils.py` and `video/utils.py`.

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Prompt Hardening and Review
    - **Description**:
        1. Regularly review and refine system prompts (defined in `backend\prompts\screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `backend\prompts\imported_code_prompts.py`, `backend\prompts\test_prompts.py`, and potentially `backend\prompts\claude_prompts.py` for video prompts like `VIDEO_PROMPT`) used to instruct the LLMs.
        2. Analyze prompts for potential biases, unintended consequences, or loopholes that could be exploited through indirect prompt injection or unexpected LLM behaviors.
        3. Implement version control for prompts and keep a history of changes to track modifications and facilitate rollbacks if necessary.
        4. Consider using techniques like prompt templates and parameterization to further control prompt structure and content, reducing variability and potential for unexpected outputs.
    - **Threats Mitigated**:
        - Indirect Prompt Injection (Medium Severity): While direct prompt injection via user input is limited, carefully crafted inputs or system prompts themselves might lead to unintended or subtly manipulated LLM behavior.
        - Unintended LLM Behavior (Medium Severity): Poorly designed or unreviewed prompts might lead to the LLM generating unexpected, incorrect, or even harmful code outputs.
    - **Impact**:
        - Reduces the likelihood of unintended or manipulable LLM behavior arising from the system prompts themselves. Improves the predictability and reliability of the code generation process.
    - **Currently Implemented**:
        - Partially. System prompts are defined in Python files and are under version control as part of the codebase. Video prompt `VIDEO_PROMPT` is also defined in `backend\prompts\claude_prompts.py`.
    - **Missing Implementation**:
        - Prompt Review Process: Establish a formal process for reviewing and approving changes to system prompts, including video prompts. This should involve security considerations and testing of prompt behavior.
        - Prompt Versioning: Although prompts are versioned with code, consider explicit versioning or tagging of prompts for better tracking and rollback capabilities.
        - Prompt Templating: Explore using prompt templating libraries to standardize prompt creation and manage parameters more effectively.

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Secure Code Evaluation Environment
    - **Description**:
        1. If the evaluation process (triggered by endpoints in `backend\routes\evals.py`) involves executing the generated code, ensure this execution happens in a sandboxed or isolated environment.
        2. Use secure containers (like Docker) or virtual machines to isolate the evaluation process from the main application and the host system.
        3. Implement strict resource limits (CPU, memory, network) for the evaluation environment to prevent denial-of-service or resource exhaustion attacks caused by malicious generated code.
        4. Sanitize and validate file paths used in evaluation processes to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities, especially when handling user-provided or LLM-generated file names or paths.
        5. Avoid direct execution of generated code if possible. If execution is necessary, prefer static analysis or safe execution methods over directly running code with system-level privileges.
    - **Threats Mitigated**:
        - Code Injection during Evaluation (High Severity): Maliciously generated code, if executed in an insecure environment during evaluation, could compromise the server or access sensitive data.
        - Path Traversal in Evaluation Endpoints (Medium Severity): Vulnerable file path handling in evaluation endpoints like those in `backend\routes\evals.py` could allow attackers to read or write arbitrary files on the server.
        - Denial of Service during Evaluation (Medium Severity): Malicious or poorly generated code in evaluations could consume excessive resources, leading to denial of service.
    - **Impact**:
        - Significantly reduces the risk of server compromise, data breaches, or denial-of-service attacks arising from the code evaluation process.
    - **Currently Implemented**:
        - Not explicitly seen in the provided files. The `evals.py` routes suggest code evaluation is performed, but the security of the evaluation environment is not detailed.
    - **Missing Implementation**:
        - Sandboxed Evaluation Environment: Implement a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker container, VM) for executing generated code during evaluations.
        - Path Sanitization in Evals: Review and sanitize file paths in `backend\routes\evals.py` to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
        - Resource Limits for Evaluation: Implement resource limits for the evaluation environment to mitigate DoS risks.
        - Secure Evaluation Practices Documentation: Document the secure code evaluation practices implemented, including details of sandboxing, resource limits, and path sanitization.

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Secure Temporary File Handling for Video Processing
    - **Description**:
        1.  When processing video inputs in `video/utils.py`, ensure temporary files created for video and screenshots are handled securely.
        2.  Use `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` with `delete=True` (as currently implemented in `video/utils.py`) to automatically delete temporary video files after processing.
        3.  For debugging purposes, saving screenshots to a temporary directory (`save_images_to_tmp` in `video/utils.py`), consider if this is necessary in production and if so, implement secure cleanup of these directories after debugging is complete or after a reasonable time period.  If possible, avoid saving to disk even for debugging and use in-memory buffers.
        4.  Ensure proper permissions are set for temporary directories and files to restrict access to authorized processes only.
    - **Threats Mitigated**:
        - Temporary File Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity): Insecure handling of temporary files can lead to vulnerabilities like information disclosure, unauthorized access, or denial of service if temporary files are not properly cleaned up or if permissions are too lax.
    - **Impact**:
        - Reduces the risk associated with insecure temporary file handling during video processing. Prevents potential information leakage or unauthorized access to temporary files.
    - **Currently Implemented**:
        - Partially. `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` with `delete=True` is used for video file in `video/utils.py`.
    - **Missing Implementation**:
        - Secure Screenshot Debugging: Re-evaluate the need for saving screenshots to temporary directories for debugging in production. If necessary, implement secure cleanup mechanism for these directories. Consider using in-memory buffers instead of saving to disk for debugging if feasible.
        - Temporary Directory Permissions: Review and ensure proper permissions are set for temporary directories used by the application to restrict access.
        - Documentation for Temporary File Handling: Document the temporary file handling practices, especially for video processing, and any cleanup mechanisms in place.

- **Mitigation Strategy**: Review and Sanitize WebSocket Error Messages
    - **Description**:
        1. Review error messages sent back to the frontend via WebSocket in `generate_code.py` (using `throw_error` function).
        2. Ensure error messages do not expose sensitive information about the server, internal configurations, or API keys.
        3. Provide generic error messages to the frontend and log detailed error information on the server-side for debugging and monitoring purposes (as currently done with `print(message)` in `throw_error`). Use structured logging to facilitate analysis.
    - **Threats Mitigated**:
        - Information Disclosure via Error Messages (Low to Medium Severity): Verbose error messages sent to the frontend could potentially leak sensitive information to attackers, aiding in reconnaissance or further attacks.
    - **Impact**:
        - Reduces the risk of information disclosure through error messages. Improves the security posture by limiting potentially sensitive information exposure to the frontend and external users.
    - **Currently Implemented**:
        - Partially. Error messages are sent to the frontend as JSON with `type: "error"` in `generate_code.py`. Server-side logging (`print(message)`) is also in place for debugging.
    - **Missing Implementation**:
        - Error Message Sanitization: Implement a process to sanitize error messages before sending them to the frontend. Replace specific error details with generic messages for the user interface.
        - Structured Logging: Enhance server-side logging to use structured logging (e.g., JSON format) for easier analysis and monitoring of errors. This will help in debugging without exposing sensitive details in frontend error messages.
