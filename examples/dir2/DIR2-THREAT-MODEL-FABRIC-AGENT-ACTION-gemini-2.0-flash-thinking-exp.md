## Threat Model for Fabric Agent Action

This document outlines the threat model for the Fabric Agent Action, focusing on threats introduced by the action itself and its dependencies, specifically Fabric Patterns and Large Language Models (LLMs). General web application threats are excluded.

### Threat List

- **Threat:** Unauthorized Workflow Execution and API Abuse
  - **Description:** An attacker, without proper authorization, could trigger the GitHub Action in a repository. This could be achieved through pull requests from forks, issue/PR comments in public repositories, or other GitHub events if access controls are not correctly configured. By triggering the action, the attacker could consume the repository owner's API credits for LLM services (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic), leading to unexpected costs.
  - **Impact:** Financial loss due to API credit consumption, potential denial of service by exhausting API limits, and unauthorized use of the action's capabilities.
  - **Affected Component:** GitHub Actions workflow configuration, entrypoint script, action.yml, overall action design.
  - **Current Mitigations:** The README.md explicitly mentions access control patterns using `if` conditions in workflow files to restrict execution based on event context (e.g., pull request origin, comment author, actor). This documentation helps users implement mitigations, but the action itself doesn't enforce them. This reduces the risk severity but doesn't eliminate it completely.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement default secure workflow configurations in examples, emphasizing access control.
    - Provide a GitHub Action that automatically checks for common insecure configurations in workflow files using this action.
    - Consider adding rate limiting or budget controls within the action itself to prevent excessive API usage, although this might be complex to implement in a GitHub Action context.
  - **Risk Severity:** High

- **Threat:** Exposure of API Keys through Logging or Output
  - **Description:** If debug or verbose logging is enabled, or if the action is misconfigured, API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) could potentially be logged or inadvertently included in the action's output (e.g., written to the output file or exposed in LangSmith traces if not properly configured). This could happen if environment variables are echoed or if error messages include sensitive information.
  - **Impact:** Full compromise of API keys, allowing unauthorized access to LLM services under the compromised account. This can lead to significant financial costs, data breaches if the LLM service stores data, and reputational damage.
  - **Affected Component:** Logging configuration in `graphs.py`, argument parsing in `app.py`, entrypoint script, potentially LangSmith integration if not configured securely, `llms.py` (API key retrieval).
  - **Current Mitigations:**  Standard GitHub Actions best practices for secrets management are expected to be used by users (using `${{ secrets.API_KEY }}`). The code itself doesn't seem to explicitly log API keys in the provided files, but verbose/debug logging increases the risk of accidental exposure.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement strict secret scrubbing in logging and output handling to ensure API keys are never exposed, even in debug mode.
    - Review and harden logging configurations in `graphs.py` to avoid accidental exposure of sensitive environment variables.
    - Document best practices for secure logging and LangSmith usage, emphasizing the need to avoid exposing secrets in traces.
  - **Risk Severity:** Critical

- **Threat:** Malicious Input Injection leading to Agent Misbehavior or Vulnerability Exploitation
  - **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious input to the Fabric Agent Action (through input files, issue/PR comments, etc.) that could cause the agent to behave unexpectedly. This could involve prompt injection attacks against the LLM, potentially leading to the execution of unintended Fabric patterns, bypassing intended logic, or even exploiting vulnerabilities within the Fabric patterns themselves or the underlying LLM. The action supports different agent types (router, react, react\_issue, react\_pr as seen in `test_agent.py`), each potentially having different input handling and vulnerabilities. The increased number of fabric tools in `fabric_tools.py` expands the attack surface for this threat, as there are more functionalities that could be targeted.
  - **Impact:** Unintended actions performed by the agent, potential data manipulation or leakage, execution of malicious Fabric patterns if vulnerabilities exist, and potential compromise of the workflow or repository environment depending on the severity of the exploit.
  - **Affected Component:** Agent logic in `agents.py`, input parsing in `app.py`, Fabric pattern execution in `fabric_tools.py`, LLM interaction, expanded set of fabric tools, different agent types (router, react, react\_issue, react\_pr).
  - **Current Mitigations:** The action relies on Fabric Patterns, which are designed to be secure tools. However, the security of individual patterns and the LLM's response to crafted inputs is not guaranteed. The action itself doesn't implement specific input sanitization or validation beyond what Fabric patterns might do internally.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement input sanitization and validation at the action level to prevent common injection attacks.
    - Regularly audit and test Fabric patterns for potential vulnerabilities and injection risks.
    - Consider using LLM security best practices, such as input/output filtering and sandboxing, although these might be complex to implement within the action.
    - Document the risks of input injection and advise users to carefully control the sources of input to the action.
  - **Risk Severity:** High

- **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) or Cost Exhaustion through Resource Intensive Patterns
  - **Description:** An attacker could intentionally trigger the execution of resource-intensive Fabric patterns repeatedly or in a loop, leading to excessive consumption of compute resources in the GitHub Actions environment and potentially exhausting API credits for LLM services. This could be achieved by providing input that forces the agent to repeatedly call expensive patterns or by simply triggering the action many times. The expanded set of fabric tools in `fabric_tools.py` might include more resource-intensive patterns, potentially increasing the risk of this threat.
  - **Impact:** Denial of service for the repository's workflows, financial loss due to excessive API usage, and potential disruption of automated processes.
  - **Affected Component:** Workflow execution, agent logic, Fabric pattern selection and execution, resource consumption of LLMs and GitHub Actions runners, expanded set of fabric tools.
  - **Current Mitigations:**  The `fabric_max_num_turns` input, managed in `graphs.py`, limits the number of turns in ReAct agents, which can indirectly limit resource consumption. However, a single turn could still be resource-intensive depending on the pattern. Access controls can limit who can trigger the action, reducing the attack surface.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement resource usage monitoring and limits within the action to prevent excessive consumption.
    - Provide options to configure resource limits for specific Fabric patterns or agent types.
    - Consider adding circuit breaker patterns to stop execution if resource consumption exceeds thresholds.
  - **Risk Severity:** Medium

- **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
  - **Description:** The Fabric Agent Action relies on various Python packages (LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. as listed in `pyproject.toml`) and the underlying Docker image. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited by an attacker if they can somehow influence the action's execution environment or input.
  - **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, impacts could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution within the GitHub Actions environment.
  - **Affected Component:** Python dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml` (e.g., `langchain`, `langgraph`, `langchain-openai`, `langchain-anthropic`), Docker image (`Dockerfile`).
  - **Current Mitigations:** The `ci.yaml` and `publish.yaml` workflows include security checks using Bandit (as seen in `pyproject.toml` dev dependencies) and Dockerfile linting, which helps identify some types of vulnerabilities. Regular dependency updates are also implied by standard development practices.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using tools like Dependabot or Snyk).
    - Regularly update dependencies to the latest secure versions.
    - Document the dependencies and their security considerations for users.
  - **Risk Severity:** Medium

- **Threat:** Insecure Docker Image
  - **Description:** The Docker image used for the action (`Dockerfile`) or its base image (`python:3.11-alpine`) could contain vulnerabilities. If an attacker can compromise the Docker image registry or exploit vulnerabilities in the image, they could potentially gain control over the action's execution environment.
  - **Impact:** Container escape, remote code execution within the GitHub Actions runner, and potential compromise of the workflow or repository.
  - **Affected Component:** Dockerfile, base image, container runtime environment.
  - **Current Mitigations:** Dockerfile linting in CI (`ci.yaml`, `publish.yaml`). Using a relatively minimal base image (`alpine`) reduces the attack surface compared to larger images.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Regularly scan the Docker image for vulnerabilities using container image scanning tools.
    - Follow Docker security best practices in the Dockerfile (e.g., using non-root user, minimal image layers).
    - Consider using a hardened base image if available and appropriate.
  - **Risk Severity:** Medium

- **Threat:** Fabric Pattern File Tampering or Injection
  - **Description:** The `FabricTools` class reads fabric patterns from markdown files within the `prompts/fabric_patterns` directory. If an attacker gains write access to the repository, they could tamper with existing pattern files or inject new malicious ones. This could lead to the execution of attacker-controlled prompts, bypassing intended logic, or gaining unauthorized access to resources. Additionally, the `generate_fabric_tools.py` script uses an LLM to generate code for fabric tools. If this code generation process is compromised (e.g., through prompt injection or vulnerabilities in the script itself), malicious code could be injected into the fabric tools.
  - **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code through manipulated fabric patterns, data exfiltration, unauthorized actions performed by the agent, and potential compromise of the workflow or repository environment.
  - **Affected Component:** `FabricTools.read_fabric_pattern` function, file system access, fabric pattern files in `prompts/fabric_patterns`, `generate_fabric_tools.py` script, LLM code generation process.
  - **Current Mitigations:**  Repository access controls (GitHub permissions) are the primary mitigation. If an attacker cannot write to the repository, they cannot directly modify pattern files. However, if there are vulnerabilities in other parts of the workflow that allow for code execution or file manipulation, this threat becomes relevant.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement integrity checks for fabric pattern files (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures) to detect tampering.
    - Consider storing fabric patterns in a read-only location or a more secure storage mechanism if feasible.
    - Regularly audit and review fabric patterns for malicious content or unintended behavior, including the code generated by `generate_fabric_tools.py`.
    - Secure the code generation process in `generate_fabric_tools.py` to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
  - **Risk Severity:** High

- **Threat:** Path Traversal in Fabric Pattern Loading
  - **Description:** The `FabricTools.read_fabric_pattern` function constructs file paths to load fabric patterns. If the `pattern_name` input to this function is not properly validated and sanitized, an attacker might be able to use path traversal techniques (e.g., `../`, absolute paths) to read files outside the intended `prompts/fabric_patterns` directory. This could lead to information disclosure by reading sensitive files within the repository or even the GitHub Actions runner environment.
  - **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential exposure of sensitive data, and in extreme cases, potential for further exploitation if exposed files contain secrets or executable code.
  - **Affected Component:** `FabricTools.read_fabric_pattern` function, file path construction, input validation for `pattern_name`.
  - **Current Mitigations:** The code does not currently implement explicit path traversal prevention. The risk is mitigated by the assumption that `pattern_name` is controlled and well-formed. However, if `pattern_name` is derived from user input or an external source without proper validation, this threat is present.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement strict input validation and sanitization for the `pattern_name` parameter in `FabricTools.read_fabric_pattern` to prevent path traversal.
    - Ensure that file path construction uses secure methods that prevent interpretation of path traversal sequences.
    - Consider using a sandboxed file system or restricted file access permissions for the action to limit the impact of potential path traversal vulnerabilities.
  - **Risk Severity:** Medium

- **Threat:** Fabric Tool Filtering Bypass or Vulnerability
  - **Description:** The `FabricTools.get_fabric_tools` method implements filtering of fabric tools based on include/exclude lists and a maximum number of tools. If there are vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in this filtering logic, an attacker might be able to bypass the intended filtering and access fabric tools that should be restricted. This could lead to the execution of unintended or potentially malicious fabric patterns. The integration tests using `fabric_patterns_included` in `test_agent.py` highlight the usage of this filtering mechanism, suggesting its importance and potential attack surface.
  - **Impact:** Execution of unintended fabric patterns, potential for malicious actions if restricted patterns are compromised or vulnerable, bypassing intended security controls.
  - **Affected Component:** `FabricTools.get_fabric_tools` method, tool filtering logic in `fabric_tools.py`, input parameters for tool filtering (`--fabric-patterns-include`, `--fabric-patterns-exclude`), `fabric_patterns_included` variable used in tests.
  - **Current Mitigations:** The filtering logic is implemented in `ToolsFilter` class (not provided in files, assumed to exist). The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the robustness and correctness of the `ToolsFilter` implementation.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Thoroughly review and test the `ToolsFilter` implementation for potential bypass vulnerabilities or logical errors.
    - Implement unit tests specifically for the tool filtering logic to ensure it behaves as expected under various conditions and inputs.
    - Consider using a more robust and well-tested filtering library or mechanism if available.
  - **Risk Severity:** Medium
