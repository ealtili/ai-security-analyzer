## Threat Model for screenshot-to-code Application

This document outlines the threat model for the `screenshot-to-code` application, focusing on threats introduced by the use of AI models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Replicate) and related functionalities.

### Threat List:

*   **Threat:** API Key Exposure
    *   Description: Attackers may gain unauthorized access to API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate, or ScreenshotOne, which are used by the application to access AI models and screenshot services. This could occur through various means, including:
        *   Compromising the user's browser storage where the frontend might store API keys.
        *   Gaining access to the backend server or environment where API keys are configured as environment variables.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application to extract API keys from memory or logs.
        Once an attacker possesses valid API keys, they can:
        *   Consume the application's API credits, leading to financial losses for the application owner.
        *   Utilize the AI models or screenshot services for their own malicious purposes, potentially masking their activities under the application's identity.
        *   Disrupt the application's functionality by exhausting API quotas or intentionally misusing the AI services.
    *   Impact: Financial loss due to unauthorized API usage, service disruption or denial of service if API keys are revoked or quotas are exhausted, misuse of AI or screenshot services under the application's identity, potential data breaches if API keys are used to access other services.
    *   Affected component: Frontend (settings storage, if API keys are stored in browser), Backend (configuration management, environment variable handling), Configuration files (.env files), `run_image_generation_evals.py`, `evals/core.py`, `image_generation/core.py`, `generate_code.py`, `screenshot.py`.
    *   Current Mitigations:
        *   The backend application reads API keys from environment variables, which is a standard practice to avoid hardcoding secrets in the code. This reduces the risk compared to hardcoding, but environment variable security depends on the server environment configuration.
        *   The README mentions "Your key is only stored in your browser. Never stored on our servers," suggesting client-side storage for API keys in the frontend. Browser storage provides a degree of client-side isolation but is vulnerable to browser-based attacks (e.g., XSS, malware).
        *   Risk severity is currently **high** due to potential for significant financial and operational impact and reliance on client-side security for frontend key storage.
    *   Missing Mitigations:
        *   **Backend:** Implement more robust secret management practices for backend API keys, such as using dedicated secret management vaults (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) instead of relying solely on environment variables. Regularly rotate API keys.
        *   **Frontend:**  Avoid storing sensitive API keys directly in browser storage if possible. If client-side API key input is necessary, consider using a more secure method for temporary storage or implement encryption for browser storage. Educate users about the risks of storing API keys in the browser and recommend best practices for browser security.
        *   **General:** Implement monitoring and alerting for API key usage to detect anomalous activity that could indicate compromised keys.
    *   Risk Severity: **High**

*   **Threat:** Malicious Code Generation by AI Models
    *   Description: The AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Flux) are used to generate code based on user-provided screenshots or videos. There is a risk that these models, due to vulnerabilities in their training data, prompt engineering, or inherent limitations, may generate code that contains:
        *   Security vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, insecure API calls).
        *   Backdoors or intentionally malicious logic designed to compromise systems or data.
        *   Inefficient or poorly performing code that can lead to denial-of-service conditions or resource exhaustion.
        Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities in the generated code if it is directly deployed without proper review and testing. The system prompts (`screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `imported_code_prompts.py`) instruct the AI models to generate complete, functional code, increasing the risk if users deploy the code without scrutiny.
    *   Impact: Security breaches in applications built using the generated code, data loss or corruption, system compromise, reputational damage, legal liabilities.
    *   Affected component: Backend (LLM interaction module, prompt generation logic), AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Flux), Output code (HTML, CSS, React, etc.), `screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `imported_code_prompts.py`, `generate_code.py`.
    *   Current Mitigations:
        *   The project files do not explicitly mention mitigations against malicious code generation in production. The evaluation process in `mock_llm.py` focuses on functional accuracy rather than code security, as seen in the mock code examples.
        *   Implicit mitigation: The application is positioned as a tool for generating *prototype* code, implying that the generated code is expected to be reviewed and further developed by human developers before deployment. This relies on the user's awareness and security practices.
        *   Risk severity is currently **medium** as the tool is not designed for direct production deployment of generated code, but the risk increases if users blindly trust and deploy the AI-generated output.
    *   Missing Mitigations:
        *   **Code Scanning:** Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the workflow to automatically scan the AI-generated code for common vulnerabilities before presenting it to the user.
        *   **User Warnings:**  Display prominent warnings to users about the inherent security risks of using AI-generated code. Emphasize the need for thorough code review, security testing, and manual adjustments by human developers before deploying the code in any environment.
        *   **Output Validation (Limited):** Explore techniques to validate the AI-generated code against a set of security best practices or known vulnerability patterns. This might be challenging due to the creative nature of code generation, but basic checks could be implemented.
        *   **Model Hardening (External):** Stay informed about security advisories and best practices related to the AI models themselves and any known vulnerabilities in their output generation. Encourage the use of more secure or fine-tuned AI models if available in the future.
    *   Risk Severity: **Medium** (increasing to high if generated code is used without review).

*   **Threat:** Data Leakage to Third-Party AI and Screenshot Providers
    *   Description: When users utilize the `screenshot-to-code` application, their screenshots, videos, and potentially related prompts are transmitted to third-party AI service providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate) to generate code or images, and to ScreenshotOne for capturing website screenshots. This process introduces the risk of data leakage, where sensitive information contained within the screenshots, videos or prompts could be:
        *   Logged or stored by the AI or screenshot providers for model training, service improvement, or other purposes as per their data privacy policies.
        *   Potentially exposed in the event of a security breach or data leak at the provider's infrastructure.
        *   Accessed by unauthorized personnel at the provider, depending on their internal access controls and data handling practices.
        This is especially concerning if the screenshots or videos contain confidential or proprietary information, personal data, or intellectual property. URLs sent to ScreenshotOne may also contain sensitive information in the URL path or query parameters.
    *   Impact: Privacy violations, regulatory non-compliance (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), loss of confidential or proprietary information, reputational damage, legal liabilities, erosion of user trust.
    *   Affected component: Backend (LLM interaction module, API communication, image/video processing module, screenshot module), AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Flux), ScreenshotOne API, Network communication channels, `generate_code.py`, `screenshot.py`, `video/utils.py`.
    *   Current Mitigations:
        *   Reliance on the data privacy policies and security practices of the third-party AI and screenshot service providers. The application developers have limited control over how these providers handle user data.
        *   The use of `mock_llm.py` for development and testing *temporarily mitigates* this risk in non-production environments, as no data is sent to third-party providers when using the mock. However, this mitigation is limited to development and testing phases.
        *   The README statement "Your key is only stored in your browser. Never stored on our servers" primarily addresses API key storage, not the screenshot/video data or URLs themselves. It doesn't mitigate data transmission and potential logging by AI or screenshot providers in production.
        *   Risk severity is currently **medium** due to the inherent reliance on external providers and potential for sensitive data to be processed by them in production.
    *   Missing Mitigations:
        *   **Privacy Policy Review and Documentation:** Thoroughly review and document the data privacy policies of OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate, and ScreenshotOne, specifically concerning data retention, usage, and security. Make this information transparently available to users.
        *   **User Consent and Transparency:** Implement clear user consent mechanisms and provide users with transparent information about how their screenshots, videos and data will be used by the application and the AI/screenshot providers. Allow users to make informed decisions about using the service, especially with sensitive data.
        *   **Data Minimization:**  Explore techniques to minimize the amount of data sent to AI and screenshot providers. For example, pre-process screenshots/videos to remove or redact sensitive information if feasible, while still allowing the AI to generate code effectively.  Consider URL sanitization before sending to ScreenshotOne.
        *   **Anonymization (Limited):** Consider if there are any anonymization techniques that can be applied to screenshots or videos before sending them to AI providers without significantly degrading the code generation quality. This may be challenging for visual data.
        *   **Alternative Privacy-Focused Models/Services:** Investigate and potentially offer users the option to use more privacy-focused AI models or on-premise AI solutions if data privacy is a paramount concern. This may involve exploring open-source models or AI providers with stronger privacy commitments. Investigate alternative screenshot services with better privacy policies or self-hosted options.
        *   **Data Processing Agreements (DPAs):** For enterprise or higher-sensitivity use cases, explore establishing Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with the AI and screenshot providers to ensure contractual commitments regarding data privacy and security.
    *   Risk Severity: **Medium** (can escalate to high depending on the sensitivity of user screenshots/videos and regulatory context).

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) and Rate Limiting
    *   Description: The `screenshot-to-code` application relies on external AI APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate) and the ScreenshotOne API, all of which are typically rate-limited.  Malicious actors or even a surge in legitimate user traffic could lead to:
        *   **API Rate Limiting:** Exceeding the rate limits imposed by OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate, or ScreenshotOne. This can result in temporary or prolonged service disruptions for users, as the application will be unable to access the AI models or screenshot service.
        *   **ScreenshotOne Service Outage:**  Service unavailability of ScreenshotOne would directly impact the screenshot functionality of the application.
        *   **Intentional DoS Attacks:** Attackers could intentionally flood the application with numerous requests to exhaust API quotas, trigger rate limits, or cause performance degradation on the backend or ScreenshotOne's service, leading to a denial of service for other users.
        *   **Increased Operational Costs:**  In scenarios with usage-based API pricing, a surge in requests (whether legitimate or malicious) can significantly increase operational costs for the application owner, including costs associated with ScreenshotOne API usage.
    *   Impact: Service disruption or denial of service for legitimate users, degraded user experience, increased operational costs, potential financial losses.
    *   Affected component: Backend (LLM interaction module, API request handling, image/video processing module, screenshot module), AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Flux), ScreenshotOne API, Network infrastructure, `generate_code.py`, `screenshot.py`.
    *   Current Mitigations:
        *   The project files do not explicitly mention any specific rate limiting or DoS prevention mechanisms implemented within the application itself for production.
        *   The use of `mock_llm.py` for development and testing *completely mitigates* this risk in non-production environments for AI APIs, as it does not involve external API calls or rate limits. However, this mitigation is only for development and testing. It does not mitigate ScreenshotOne dependency in features utilizing screenshots from URLs.
        *   Implicit mitigation: Reliance on the rate limiting mechanisms provided by the AI and screenshot service providers in production. However, these provider-side limits might not be sufficient to protect the application from all DoS scenarios or cost overruns.
        *   Risk severity is currently **medium** due to the potential for service disruptions and cost implications in production.
    *   Missing Mitigations:
        *   **Application-Level Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting mechanisms within the backend application itself to control the number of requests sent to the AI and screenshot APIs from each user or IP address within a specific time window. This can help prevent abuse and manage traffic spikes.
        *   **Request Queuing and Prioritization:** Implement request queuing to handle traffic surges gracefully. Prioritize legitimate user requests if possible and potentially defer or reject excessive or suspicious requests.
        *   **API Usage Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up monitoring and alerting systems to track API usage metrics (request rates, error rates, quota consumption). Alert administrators to unusual activity patterns or potential DoS attacks. Monitor ScreenshotOne API usage as well.
        *   **Caching of AI Responses (Carefully):** Implement caching mechanisms to store and reuse AI responses for identical or very similar input screenshots/videos, especially for common UI patterns. This can significantly reduce the number of API calls and alleviate rate limiting issues. However, caching needs to be implemented carefully to avoid serving stale or incorrect code.
        *   **Load Balancing and Scalability:** Ensure that the backend infrastructure is sufficiently scalable to handle expected user traffic and potential spikes in demand. Use load balancing to distribute requests across multiple backend instances if necessary.
        *   **Fallback Screenshot Mechanism:** Consider implementing a fallback mechanism for screenshot capture if ScreenshotOne is unavailable, or allow users to upload screenshots directly as an alternative.
    *   Risk Severity: **Medium**

*   **Threat:** Mock LLM/Code Inconsistencies and Deployment Errors
    *   Description: The application utilizes `mock_llm.py` for development and testing, which simulates the behavior of real LLMs. This introduces several risks:
        *   **Behavioral Discrepancies:** The mock LLM's responses might not perfectly mirror the responses of actual AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) in terms of code quality, functionality, or security vulnerabilities. This can lead to a false sense of security or incomplete testing if the mock behaves differently than the real models in critical scenarios.
        *   **Configuration Drift:** Developers might inadvertently configure the application to use the mock LLM in production environments, especially if environment variables or configuration settings are not properly managed. Deploying with the mock LLM instead of real models would result in the application not functioning as intended, as the mock provides static, predefined responses and does not connect to actual AI services.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Mock Code/Data:**  The code snippets and data within `mock_llm.py`, such as the quiz application example, could themselves contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, insecure JavaScript, use of external, potentially untrusted image URLs). If these mock components are used in development or testing environments that are not isolated, these vulnerabilities could be exploited, or developers might unknowingly propagate these vulnerabilities into production code if they copy and paste from mock outputs without proper review.
    *   Impact: Application malfunction in production if mock LLM is mistakenly deployed, security vulnerabilities introduced through mock code examples or data, incomplete security testing due to behavioral differences between mock and real LLMs, leading to potential vulnerabilities in production.
    *   Affected component: `mock_llm.py` module, Backend (LLM interaction module, configuration management), Development and testing environments, `generate_code.py`.
    *   Current Mitigations:
        *   The existence of `mock_llm.py` encourages development and testing without direct reliance on external AI APIs, which can be beneficial for stability and cost control during development. The `SHOULD_MOCK_AI_RESPONSE` flag in `config.py` and used in `generate_code.py` controls mock usage.
        *   Risk severity is currently **medium** due to the potential for misconfiguration and discrepancies leading to production issues or missed vulnerabilities.
    *   Missing Mitigations:
        *   **Environment Awareness:** Implement clear environment detection and configuration management to ensure that the application always uses the intended LLM (mock or real) based on the deployment environment (development, testing, production). Use environment variables or configuration files to explicitly define which LLM implementation should be used.
        *   **Testing with Real LLMs:** Ensure that security testing and integration testing are performed using *real* AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Flux) in staging or pre-production environments that closely mirror the production setup. This will help identify vulnerabilities and behavioral differences that might not be apparent when using mocks.
        *   **Code Review for Mock Outputs:** When using mock LLM outputs for development or testing, developers should still conduct thorough code reviews of the generated code snippets and data, treating them as potentially untrusted input. Do not assume that mock code is inherently secure.
        *   **Static Analysis for Mock Code/Data:** Apply static analysis security testing (SAST) tools even to the mock code snippets and data in `mock_llm.py` to identify any potential vulnerabilities within the mock data itself.
        *   **Deployment Checks:** Implement automated checks during the deployment process to verify that the application is configured to use the correct (real) LLM implementation and that mock configurations are not being pushed to production.
    *   Risk Severity: **Medium**

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Debug Artifacts
    *   Description: The application uses `DebugFileWriter.py` to write debug artifacts to local files when debugging is enabled. If debugging is inadvertently enabled in production, or if the debug artifacts directory is not properly secured:
        *   Sensitive information, such as API keys, user inputs, prompts, LLM responses, or intermediate code, could be written to debug log files.
        *   Attackers who gain access to the server or the debug artifacts directory could read these files and extract sensitive information.
    *   Impact: Sensitive information disclosure, potential API key compromise, privacy violations, unauthorized access to application internals.
    *   Affected component: `debug/DebugFileWriter.py`, Backend server environment, File system, `generate_code.py`.
    *   Current Mitigations:
        *   The `DebugFileWriter` is conditioned by `IS_DEBUG_ENABLED` flag in `config.py`, suggesting a mechanism to disable debugging in production.
        *   Risk severity is currently **medium** assuming debugging is intended to be disabled in production, but risk increases to high if debugging is left enabled or misconfigured.
    *   Missing Mitigations:
        *   **Strict Debug Mode Management:** Implement robust configuration management to ensure that debugging is strictly disabled in production environments. Use environment variables or configuration files to control debug mode and enforce its state during deployment.
        *   **Secure Debug Artifacts Directory:** If debugging is necessary in staging or production for troubleshooting (which is generally discouraged), ensure that the debug artifacts directory is securely configured with restricted access permissions, preventing unauthorized access.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to verify that debug mode is disabled in production and that debug artifact directories are not exposed.
        *   **Minimize Debug Logging in Production (If Necessary):** If debug logging is unavoidable in production, minimize the amount of sensitive information logged. Avoid logging API keys, user credentials, or highly confidential data in debug logs.
    *   Risk Severity: **Medium** (can escalate to high if debugging is enabled in production or logs are exposed).

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Application Logs
    *   Description: The application uses `fs_logging/core.py` to log prompts and LLM completions to local files. If logging is enabled in production and the logs directory is not properly secured:
        *   Sensitive information, such as user prompts, generated code, or application interactions, could be written to log files.
        *   Attackers who gain access to the server or the logs directory could read these files and extract sensitive information.
    *   Impact: Sensitive information disclosure, privacy violations, potential intellectual property leakage, unauthorized access to application usage data.
    *   Affected component: `fs_logging/core.py`, Backend server environment, File system, `generate_code.py`.
    *   Current Mitigations:
        *   The logging functionality is implemented, suggesting awareness of logging needs, but there are no explicit mitigations for secure log management in the provided files. `generate_code.py` uses `write_logs`.
        *   Risk severity is currently **medium** as logging in production without security measures poses a risk of information exposure.
    *   Missing Mitigations:
        *   **Secure Log Storage:**  Ensure that the logs directory is securely configured with restricted access permissions, preventing unauthorized access. Store logs in a dedicated, secured location, not within the web application's publicly accessible directories.
        *   **Log Rotation and Retention Policies:** Implement log rotation to manage log file size and retention policies to limit the duration logs are stored, reducing the window of exposure.
        *   **Centralized Logging (Recommended):** Consider using a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, cloud-based logging services) instead of local file system logging for production environments. Centralized logging provides better security controls, access management, and monitoring capabilities.
        *   **Log Sanitization (If Necessary):** If logs might contain sensitive data, implement log sanitization techniques to remove or mask sensitive information before writing logs. However, minimize logging of sensitive data in the first place.
        *   **Access Control for Logs:** Implement strict access control mechanisms for accessing log files, allowing only authorized personnel to view logs.
    *   Risk Severity: **Medium** (can escalate to high if logs are readily accessible to unauthorized parties).

*   **Threat:** Prompt Injection in Video Processing
    *   Description: The `video_to_app.py` script and `VIDEO_PROMPT` are used to process videos. If the video processing functionality incorporates user-controlled inputs (e.g., video descriptions, filenames, or user-provided prompts related to video analysis) into the prompts sent to the LLM, the application might be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. This is relevant in the context of `video/utils.py` and `generate_code.py` handling video data.
        *   Attackers could craft malicious video descriptions or filenames that, when processed, manipulate the LLM's behavior.
        *   This could lead to the LLM generating unexpected or harmful code, bypassing intended application logic, or revealing sensitive information if the prompt injection is designed to extract data from the LLM's context.
    *   Impact: Generation of vulnerable or malicious code, application malfunction, information disclosure, potential bypass of security controls.
    *   Affected component: `video_to_app.py`, `prompts/claude_prompts.py` (specifically `VIDEO_PROMPT`), Backend (video processing module, prompt construction logic), AI models (Claude), `video/utils.py`, `generate_code.py`.
    *   Current Mitigations:
        *   The provided files do not show explicit mitigations against prompt injection in video processing. The vulnerability depends on how user inputs (if any) are incorporated into the video processing prompts.
        *   Risk severity is currently **medium** as the potential for prompt injection exists if user inputs are not properly handled in prompt construction.
    *   Missing Mitigations:
        *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Sanitize and validate any user inputs that are incorporated into video processing prompts.  Remove or neutralize potentially malicious characters or sequences that could be used for prompt injection.
        *   **Prompt Engineering for Robustness:** Design prompts to be more resilient to injection attempts. Use clear instructions and delimiters to separate user inputs from trusted prompt instructions.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Prompts:** Ensure that the prompts used for video processing only grant the LLM the necessary permissions and instructions for the intended task, minimizing the potential impact of a successful injection attack.
        *   **Output Monitoring:** Monitor the outputs of the video processing functionality for unexpected or suspicious patterns that could indicate a prompt injection attack.
        *   **Regular Security Testing:** Conduct regular security testing, including prompt injection testing, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in video processing and prompt construction.
    *   Risk Severity: **Medium**

*   **Threat:** Dependency on External CDNs for Libraries
    *   Description: The system prompts (`screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `imported_code_prompts.py`, `test_prompts.py`) instruct the AI models to include various frontend libraries (Tailwind, Bootstrap, React, Vue, Ionic, Font Awesome, Google Fonts, ionicons) in the generated code by directly referencing external Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). This introduces risks associated with relying on external, third-party resources:
        *   **CDN Compromise (Supply Chain Attack):** If a CDN provider is compromised, attackers could inject malicious code into the hosted library files.  Generated code incorporating these libraries would then unknowingly include and execute the malicious code, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other client-side vulnerabilities in applications using the generated code.
        *   **CDN Availability and Integrity:** CDNs might experience outages or temporary unavailability, which would break the functionality of applications relying on them. While not strictly a security threat, it impacts availability and potentially user experience.  Furthermore, there's a risk of unintentional or malicious modification of files on the CDN, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
        *   **Version Pinning and Control:** The prompts use specific CDN links, but it's not clear if they always pin to specific versions or use "latest" tags. Using "latest" can lead to unpredictable behavior if the CDN provider updates the library with breaking changes or introduces new vulnerabilities. Lack of version pinning complicates vulnerability management and regression testing.
    *   Impact: Introduction of client-side vulnerabilities (XSS, etc.) in applications built using the generated code, application malfunction due to CDN outages or library changes, difficulty in managing dependencies and patching vulnerabilities.
    *   Affected component: `screenshot_system_prompts.py`, `imported_code_prompts.py`, `test_prompts.py`, AI-generated code (HTML, CSS, React, etc.), User applications deploying generated code.
    *   Current Mitigations:
        *   The prompts use CDN links from reputable providers (cdnjs.cloudflare.com, cdn.jsdelivr.net, unpkg.com, registry.npmmirror.com), which generally have good security practices. However, no CDN is immune to compromise.
        *   Implicit Mitigation: The generated code is intended for review and further development, giving users an opportunity to replace CDN links with locally hosted libraries or more robust dependency management practices.
        *   Risk severity is currently **medium** because while CDN compromise is not a daily occurrence, the impact could be significant, and the application directly encourages CDN usage without explicit warnings or alternative recommendations.
    *   Missing Mitigations:
        *   **User Warnings and Best Practices:** Display warnings to users about the risks of relying solely on CDNs in production environments. Recommend best practices such as:
            *   Using Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes for CDN links to ensure the integrity of downloaded files.
            *   Considering hosting libraries locally or using a package manager for better control and offline availability.
            *   Pinning specific versions of libraries in CDN links instead of using "latest".
        *   **SAST for CDN Usage:** Integrate static analysis tools or linters that can check the generated code for CDN usage and flag potential risks or missing SRI attributes.
        *   **Documentation on Dependency Management:** Provide documentation or guidance on how users can manage dependencies in their projects, moving away from direct CDN links if desired.
    *   Risk Severity: **Medium**

*   **Threat:** Insecure File Access in Evaluation Endpoints
    *   Description: The `evals.py` file defines API endpoints (`/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, `/best-of-n-evals`) that take user-provided folder paths as input. These endpoints are used to read HTML output files and input images for evaluation purposes. If these folder paths are not properly validated and sanitized, attackers could potentially exploit these endpoints to:
        *   **Directory Traversal:** By providing maliciously crafted folder paths (e.g., containing "../" sequences), attackers might be able to access files and directories outside of the intended evaluation directories on the server's file system. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive application files, configuration files, or even system files.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Even if full directory traversal is prevented, attackers might be able to read HTML output files from other users' evaluations or internal evaluation data if file access controls are not strictly enforced within the evaluation directories.
        *   **Denial of Service (File System Exhaustion):** In extreme cases, if path validation is weak and combined with other vulnerabilities, an attacker might attempt to exhaust server resources by requesting access to a large number of files or deeply nested directories.
    *   Impact: Unauthorized file system access, sensitive information disclosure, potential compromise of application or server, denial of service due to resource exhaustion.
    *   Affected component: `evals.py` (API endpoints: `/evals`, `/pairwise-evals`, `/best-of-n-evals`), Backend (file system access logic, path validation), Server file system.
    *   Current Mitigations:
        *   The `evals.py` code checks if the provided folder path exists using `folder_path.exists()`. This provides a basic level of validation but does not prevent directory traversal within an existing folder if the code later navigates based on filenames without further path sanitization.
        *   Risk severity is currently **medium** because while there's a basic check for folder existence, it's unclear how robust the path validation is against directory traversal and unauthorized file access within the evaluation directory structure itself.
    *   Missing Mitigations:
        *   **Robust Path Sanitization and Validation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all folder paths received by the evaluation endpoints. Use secure path handling functions provided by the operating system or framework to prevent directory traversal attempts (e.g., ensure paths are canonicalized and within allowed base directories).
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (File Access):** Configure the application with the principle of least privilege for file system access. Ensure that the user account running the backend process has only the necessary permissions to access the evaluation input and output directories, and no broader file system access.
        *   **Access Control for Evaluation Directories:** Implement proper access control mechanisms for the evaluation input and output directories on the server. Restrict access to these directories to only the necessary application components and administrative personnel.
        *   **Security Audits for File Access Logic:** Conduct security audits specifically focused on the file access logic in `evals.py` and related modules to identify any potential vulnerabilities related to path handling, directory traversal, or unauthorized file access.
    *   Risk Severity: **Medium** (can escalate to high if directory traversal is easily exploitable).

*   **Threat:** Insecure Temporary File Handling in Video Processing
    *   Description: The `video/utils.py` module creates temporary files to process video data. If temporary file creation and handling are not performed securely:
        *   Temporary files might be created with overly permissive access rights, allowing other users on the system to read or modify them.
        *   Temporary files might not be properly deleted after processing, potentially leading to disk space exhaustion (DoS) or leaving sensitive video data accessible for longer than necessary.
        *   Predictable naming of temporary files could allow attackers to guess file names and potentially access or manipulate them.
    *   Impact: Information disclosure (if temporary files contain sensitive video data), Denial of Service (due to disk exhaustion), unauthorized file access or modification.
    *   Affected component: `video/utils.py` (functions `split_video_into_screenshots`, `save_images_to_tmp`), Backend server environment, File system.
    *   Current Mitigations:
        *   The `video/utils.py` uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` and `tempfile.gettempdir`, which are standard Python libraries for temporary file handling and generally provide some level of security by default (e.g., unique filenames). However, default permissions and cleanup might not be sufficient for all security contexts.
        *   Risk severity is currently **medium** due to potential for insecure temporary file handling if default settings are relied upon without further hardening.
    *   Missing Mitigations:
        *   **Restrict Temporary File Permissions:** Explicitly set restrictive access permissions (e.g., 0600 on Linux/Unix systems) when creating temporary files to ensure only the application process user can access them.
        *   **Secure Temporary Directory:** Ensure that the system's temporary directory itself is securely configured and that other users cannot easily access or list its contents.
        *   **Explicit Temporary File Cleanup:** Implement explicit cleanup of temporary files after video processing is complete, even in case of errors, to minimize the window of exposure and prevent disk space issues. Use `try...finally` blocks or context managers to guarantee cleanup.
        *   **Cryptographically Secure Temporary Filenames:** While `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` provides unique filenames, ensure that the filename generation is cryptographically secure to prevent attackers from reliably predicting temporary file names if predictable names are a concern in the deployment environment.
    *   Risk Severity: **Medium**
