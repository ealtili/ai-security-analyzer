# Threat Model for Fabric Agent Action

Below is the threat model for the **Fabric Agent Action**, focusing on specific threats introduced by the application. Common web application threats are omitted.

---

## Threat 1: Unauthorized Access to the Action

- **Description**: Attackers can trigger the GitHub Action by making comments on issues or pull requests, causing the action to run and use the API keys. This leads to unauthorized LLM API usage and potentially malicious or unintended outputs. For example, an attacker submits a comment that triggers the action, consuming API resources and generating responses without authorization.

- **Impact**:
  - Increased costs due to unauthorized LLM API usage.
  - Potential disclosure of sensitive outputs or actions taken by the action.
  - Abuse of the action to perform unintended operations.

- **Affected Components**:
  - GitHub workflows invoking the action.
  - Triggers like issue comments and pull request comments.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - The README suggests implementing access control patterns, such as checking if the action is triggered by authorized users.
  - Examples in the documentation show conditions to restrict action execution based on the event initiator.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Enforce authentication checks within the action code itself.
  - Provide default secure configurations to prevent misuse.
  - Offer built-in options to easily restrict action triggers to authorized users.

- **Risk Severity**: **High**

## Threat 2: Exposure of API Keys

- **Description**: If the action is not configured securely, API keys used to access LLM providers might be exposed. This can happen through improper storage, misconfiguration, or logging of sensitive information. Attackers could then use these keys to access LLM services fraudulently.

- **Impact**:
  - Unauthorized usage of API keys leading to financial loss.
  - Potential data leakage if attackers use the keys to access sensitive information.
  - Breach of provider terms and possible account suspension.

- **Affected Components**:
  - Environment variables and secrets storage in the GitHub repository.
  - Action scripts that handle and potentially log these keys.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - The action requires API keys to be set as repository secrets.
  - Documentation advises setting required API keys in secrets.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Ensure that API keys are never outputted in logs or error messages.
  - Implement secret scanning to detect accidental exposure.
  - Use GitHub's secret masking features to prevent logging of secrets.

- **Risk Severity**: **High**

## Threat 3: Prompt Injection Attacks

- **Description**: Malicious users can craft inputs that manipulate the prompts sent to the LLMs, causing unintended actions or outputs. For instance, an attacker could include special tokens or instructions in issue comments that alter the behavior of the LLM, potentially extracting sensitive information or causing the LLM to execute unintended patterns.

- **Impact**:
  - Disclosure of sensitive information.
  - Execution of unauthorized actions.
  - Generation of harmful or inappropriate content.

- **Affected Components**:
  - LLM processing modules that handle user-supplied inputs.
  - Agent scripts that build and send prompts to the LLMs.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - None specified in the documentation.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Implement input validation and sanitization to remove harmful content.
  - Use strict prompt templates that are less susceptible to injection.
  - Monitor and filter LLM outputs for policy compliance.

- **Risk Severity**: **Critical**

---

## Threat 4: Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion

- **Description**: An attacker can cause the action to consume excessive resources by triggering it repeatedly or crafting inputs that lead to long or complex processing. This can exhaust API rate limits or consume compute resources, affecting availability.

- **Impact**:
  - Denial of service to legitimate users.
  - Increased operational costs due to excessive API usage.
  - Potential breach of usage limits leading to service throttling.

- **Affected Components**:
  - GitHub Actions workflows.
  - LLM API usage and associated costs.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - None specified in the documentation.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Implement rate limiting or usage quotas within the action.
  - Validate and constrain input sizes and complexities.
  - Monitor resource usage and set alerts for abnormal patterns.

- **Risk Severity**: **Medium**

---

## Threat 5: Security Vulnerabilities in Dependencies

- **Description**: The project relies on several third-party dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`. If any of these have known vulnerabilities, attackers could exploit them to compromise the action.

- **Impact**:
  - Potential code execution on the runner.
  - Data leakage or corruption.
  - Compromise of the action's integrity.

- **Affected Components**:
  - Dependencies such as `langchain`, `langgraph`, `pydantic`, etc.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - A CI workflow includes a security check with Bandit for static code analysis.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
  - Implement automated dependency scanning tools like Dependabot.
  - Enforce strict version pinning and review updates before applying.

- **Risk Severity**: **Medium**

---

## Threat 6: Code Injection via Fabric Patterns

- **Description**: The action downloads Fabric Patterns from an external GitHub repository. If an attacker compromises this repository or the download process, they could introduce malicious code into these patterns, leading to code execution within the action.

- **Impact**:
  - Unauthorized code execution on the GitHub runner.
  - Full compromise of the action environment.
  - Potential spread to other workflows or repositories.

- **Affected Components**:
  - Scripts handling pattern downloads (`scripts/download_fabric_patterns.sh`).
  - Pattern processing scripts (`scripts/generate_fabric_tools.py`).

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - None specified in the documentation.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Verify the integrity of downloaded patterns using checksums or signatures.
  - Use version pinning or specific commit hashes when downloading patterns.
  - Employ code reviews and validation for any external code before execution.

- **Risk Severity**: **Critical**

---

## Threat 7: Insecure Shell Script Execution

- **Description**: The `entrypoint.sh` script uses `eval` with arguments constructed from environment variables. If these variables are not properly sanitized, an attacker could manipulate them to execute arbitrary shell commands.

- **Impact**:
  - Arbitrary code execution on the GitHub runner.
  - Compromise of secrets and sensitive data.
  - Unauthorized access to the CI/CD environment.

- **Affected Components**:
  - `entrypoint.sh` script.
  - Any shell scripts that process unvalidated inputs.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - None specified in the documentation.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Avoid using `eval`; use safer command execution methods.
  - Properly quote and sanitize all variable expansions.
  - Implement strict input validation on environment variables.

- **Risk Severity**: **Critical**

---

## Threat 8: Secrets Exposure in Logs

- **Description**: The action may inadvertently log sensitive information like API keys if logging is set to verbose or debug modes and if variables are not properly handled. This can happen if environment variables containing secrets are printed to the console.

- **Impact**:
  - Exposure of API keys and secrets in logs.
  - Unauthorized access to LLM services.
  - Potential misuse leading to financial and reputational damage.

- **Affected Components**:
  - Logging configurations in `entrypoint.sh` and `app.py`.
  - Any debug or verbose logging statements.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - None specified in the documentation.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Ensure sensitive variables are never logged.
  - Use GitHub's secret masking features to prevent secrets from appearing in logs.
  - Review logging levels and messages to avoid accidental exposure.

- **Risk Severity**: **High**
