Mitigation Strategies for Fabric Agent Action

Here are mitigation strategies for threats introduced by using Fabric Patterns and LangGraph in the Fabric Agent Action.

- Mitigation strategy: Implement Access Control for Workflow Triggers
  - Description:
    1.  Modify GitHub workflow YAML files to include conditional checks to restrict who can trigger the workflow.
    2.  For pull requests, use `if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository` to only allow workflow execution from pull requests originating from the same repository, preventing forks from triggering actions and potentially abusing API keys.
    3.  For issue and pull request comments, use `if: github.event.comment.user.login == github.event.repository.owner.login` to restrict command execution to repository owners. For pull request comments from forks, add `if (pr.data.head.repo.owner.login !== context.repo.owner)`.
    4.  For general access control, use `if: github.actor == 'authorized-username'` to limit execution to specific authorized users.
    5.  Document these access control patterns in the `README.md` Security section and provide examples in workflow configurations.
  - List of threats mitigated:
    - Unauthorized Access and API Abuse (High severity): Prevents malicious actors or unintended users from triggering the action and consuming API resources without authorization.
  - Impact:
    - Unauthorized Access and API Abuse: High reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized usage and unexpected API costs by limiting workflow triggers to authorized sources.
  - Currently implemented:
    - Partially implemented. The `README.md` file in the `Security` section provides examples of access control patterns. The example workflows in `README.md` also demonstrate access control based on comment author and pull request origin.
  - Missing implementation:
    -  Enforce access control patterns in all example workflows and encourage users to implement these patterns in their own workflows when using the action.  Need to ensure consistent application of these patterns across all usage scenarios.

- Mitigation strategy: Input Sanitization and Validation
  - Description:
    1.  Implement input validation in `fabric_agent_action\app.py` and `fabric_agent_action\config.py` using Pydantic models to ensure that all inputs, especially those coming from user-provided files or comments, conform to expected types and formats.
    2.  Sanitize input strings in `fabric_agent_action\app.py` to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before passing them to LangGraph or Fabric patterns. This is especially important for user-provided instructions and input content. Consider using libraries designed for input sanitization to handle various injection vectors.
    3.  Consider using techniques like prompt hardening within the agent prompts themselves to make them more resilient to injection attacks.
    4.  Validate Fabric Tool names if they are ever derived from user input to ensure only allowed tools are executed.
  - List of threats mitigated:
    - Prompt Injection (High severity): Reduces the likelihood of malicious inputs manipulating the agent's behavior or Fabric patterns.
    - Misconfiguration (Medium severity): Input validation helps to catch misconfigurations early and prevent unexpected behavior.
  - Impact:
    - Prompt Injection: Medium reduction. Input sanitization and validation can significantly reduce the attack surface for prompt injection, but may not eliminate it entirely due to the complex nature of LLMs.
    - Misconfiguration: Medium reduction. Input validation helps ensure that the action is configured correctly, reducing the risk of misconfiguration-related issues.
  - Currently implemented:
    - Partially implemented. `fabric_agent_action\config.py` uses Pydantic for configuration validation, which provides some level of input validation for action parameters.
  - Missing implementation:
    -  Need to implement more robust input sanitization for user-provided content within `fabric_agent_action\app.py` before passing it to the agent.  Specifically, inputs read from `input_file` and any inputs extracted from GitHub events (like issue/PR bodies and comments) should be sanitized.  Also, explore and implement prompt hardening techniques in agent prompts in `fabric_agent_action\agents.py`. If tool names are derived from user input, add validation to ensure they are in the allowed list of tools before execution in `fabric_tools.py` and `app.py`.

- Mitigation strategy: Supply Chain Security for Fabric Patterns
  - Description:
    1.  Implement integrity checks for downloaded Fabric Patterns in `scripts/download_fabric_patterns.sh`. After downloading patterns, verify their integrity using checksums or digital signatures if available from the upstream Fabric Patterns repository.
    2.  Regularly review and audit the downloaded Fabric Patterns for any unexpected or malicious code. Focus on reviewing changes in patterns during updates.
    3.  Consider forking the Fabric Patterns repository and hosting it within your organization's control to reduce dependency on the external upstream repository. This provides greater control over the patterns used.
    4.  Implement a process to update Fabric Patterns in a controlled manner, including testing and review before deploying updated patterns. Enhance the existing `update-fabric-patterns.yaml` workflow with mandatory review steps and consider automated testing of pattern changes.
    5.  Review `scripts\generate_fabric_tools.py` to ensure the script itself does not introduce supply chain risks. While it generates code, ensure the generation process is secure and the dependencies of the script are also managed.
  - List of threats mitigated:
    - Supply Chain Attacks (Fabric Patterns) (High severity): Reduces the risk of using compromised Fabric Patterns.
    - Supply Chain Attacks (Code Generation Script) (Medium severity): Reduces the risk of compromised code generation scripts affecting the action.
  - Impact:
    - Supply Chain Attacks (Fabric Patterns): Medium to High reduction. Integrity checks and regular audits can significantly reduce the risk, but forking and controlled updates provide a higher level of security by giving more control over the supply chain.
    - Supply Chain Attacks (Code Generation Script): Low to Medium reduction. Reviewing the script and its dependencies reduces the risk of this attack vector.
  - Currently implemented:
    - Not implemented. Currently, `scripts/download_fabric_patterns.sh` simply downloads patterns without integrity checks or audits.
  - Missing implementation:
    - Implement integrity checks in `scripts/download_fabric_patterns.sh`.  Add a step in `.github\workflows\update-fabric-patterns.yaml` to manually review the changes in Fabric Patterns before merging the pull request. Explore forking the Fabric Patterns repository and modifying the scripts to download from the forked repository.  Review and secure the dependencies of `scripts\generate_fabric_tools.py`.

- Mitigation strategy: Dependency Scanning and Management
  - Description:
    1.  Integrate dependency scanning tools like `Snyk`, `OWASP Dependency-Check`, or GitHub Dependency Scanning into the CI pipeline (`.github\workflows\ci.yaml` and `.github\workflows\publish.yaml`).
    2.  Regularly update project dependencies using `poetry update` to patch known vulnerabilities. Automate dependency updates using Dependabot or similar tools.
    3.  Monitor dependency vulnerability databases for newly disclosed vulnerabilities affecting project dependencies and proactively update vulnerable dependencies. Set up alerts for new vulnerabilities.
  - List of threats mitigated:
    - Dependency Vulnerabilities (Medium severity): Reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
  - Impact:
    - Dependency Vulnerabilities: Medium reduction. Dependency scanning and regular updates help to mitigate the risk of using vulnerable dependencies, but zero-day vulnerabilities may still pose a risk.
  - Currently implemented:
    - Partially implemented. The `.github\workflows\ci.yaml` and `.github\workflows\publish.yaml` workflows include a security check with Bandit, as seen in `pyproject.toml` under `dev-dependencies`. However, Bandit is primarily for finding security issues in Python code, not dependency vulnerabilities.
  - Missing implementation:
    - Integrate dedicated dependency scanning tools into CI workflows. Add steps to update dependencies regularly and monitor for new vulnerabilities.

- Mitigation strategy: Least Privilege for API Keys
  - Description:
    1.  Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring API keys. Ensure that the API keys used by the action have only the necessary permissions required for their intended purpose. For example, if the action only needs to read issue comments, the API key should only have read permissions for comments.
    2.  Use separate API keys for different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) to limit the impact of a compromised key. If a development key is compromised, it should not affect production systems.
    3.  Rotate API keys periodically to reduce the window of opportunity if a key is compromised. Implement automated key rotation if possible.
    4.  Document best practices for API key management in the `README.md` Security section, emphasizing secure storage using GitHub Secrets and avoiding hardcoding keys in code. Provide specific examples of least privilege configurations for different use cases.
  - List of threats mitigated:
    - Unauthorized Access and API Abuse (High severity): Limits the potential damage if an API key is compromised.
    - Misconfiguration (Medium severity): Clear documentation and best practices reduce the risk of misconfiguring API keys.
  - Impact:
    - Unauthorized Access and API Abuse: Medium reduction. Least privilege and key rotation limit the impact of compromised keys.
    - Misconfiguration: Low reduction. Documentation helps users configure API keys correctly.
  - Currently implemented:
    - Partially implemented. The `README.md` mentions using GitHub secrets for API keys.
  - Missing implementation:
    -  Explicitly document the principle of least privilege and best practices for API key management in the `README.md` Security section.  Recommend periodic API key rotation. Provide concrete examples of permission scopes for API keys.

- Mitigation strategy: Secure Logging Practices
  - Description:
    1.  Review logging configurations in `fabric_agent_action\app.py` and other modules to ensure that sensitive information, such as API keys, user credentials, or input content that might contain secrets, is not logged, even in debug mode. Pay special attention to logging inputs from user comments or files.
    2.  Avoid logging full request and response payloads, especially when using verbose or debug logging. Log only necessary information for debugging and monitoring. Instead of logging full payloads, log summaries or anonymized versions.
    3.  If sensitive data needs to be logged temporarily for debugging purposes, ensure that these logs are stored securely and access is restricted to authorized personnel. Use dedicated secure logging services or mechanisms for sensitive debugging logs and remove them after debugging. Consider using logging library features to redact sensitive information before logging.
    4.  Clearly document the logging levels and what information is logged at each level in the `README.md` Debugging section.  Specify what types of information are considered sensitive and are explicitly excluded from logs.
    5.  Implement logging of Fabric Tool usage in `fabric_tools.py` or `app.py`. Log which tools are invoked, when, and by whom (if possible and relevant) to audit tool usage and detect potential misuse.  Ensure that tool usage logs do not inadvertently log sensitive input data passed to the tools.
  - List of threats mitigated:
    - Information Disclosure (Low to Medium severity): Prevents unintentional exposure of sensitive information through logs.
    - Unauthorized Activity Detection (Low severity): Tool usage logging can aid in detecting unusual or unauthorized tool execution.
  - Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: Low to Medium reduction. Secure logging practices minimize the risk of information disclosure through logs, but the effectiveness depends on careful review and configuration of logging.
    - Unauthorized Activity Detection: Low reduction. Tool usage logging provides some visibility into action execution and can help in identifying anomalies.
  - Currently implemented:
    - Partially implemented. The `fabric_agent_action\app.py` sets up logging based on verbosity levels, but there's no explicit handling to prevent logging sensitive information or to log tool usage. `graphs.py` shows logging of messages, but needs review for sensitive data.
  - Missing implementation:
    -  Review and modify logging statements in `fabric_agent_action\app.py`, `graphs.py` and other modules to prevent logging sensitive data.  Add documentation in `README.md` about secure logging practices and what information is logged at different levels. Consider using a logging library that supports redaction of sensitive data. Implement logging of Fabric Tool usage in `fabric_tools.py` or `app.py`, ensuring no sensitive data is logged in tool usage logs.

- Mitigation strategy: Fabric Tool Filtering and Authorization
  - Description:
    1.  Utilize the `FabricToolsFilter` class in `fabric_tools.py` to define allowed and disallowed Fabric Tools based on context or user roles.
    2.  Implement a mechanism to configure tool filtering. This could be through action parameters, environment variables, or a configuration file.
    3.  Document how to use tool filtering in the `README.md` Security section, providing examples of including or excluding specific tools to restrict functionality.
    4.  Consider integrating user authorization with tool filtering. For example, different users or roles could be authorized to use different sets of Fabric Tools.
  - List of threats mitigated:
    - Unauthorized Functionality Execution (Medium severity): Prevents unauthorized users or workflows from executing specific Fabric Tools that might be considered more sensitive or risky.
    - Prompt Injection leading to unintended tool use (Medium severity): Limits the impact of prompt injection by restricting the set of tools available to the agent, even if an attacker manages to manipulate the prompt.
  - Impact:
    - Unauthorized Functionality Execution: Medium reduction. Tool filtering provides a mechanism to restrict access to certain functionalities based on Fabric Tools.
    - Prompt Injection leading to unintended tool use: Medium reduction. By limiting the available tools, the potential damage from prompt injection attacks can be contained.
  - Currently implemented:
    - Partially implemented. The `FabricToolsFilter` class exists in `fabric_tools.py`, but it is not actively used or configured in the action's workflow or configuration.
  - Missing implementation:
    - Implement configuration options to enable and configure Fabric Tool filtering in the action. Integrate tool filtering into the action's execution flow in `app.py`, using the `FabricToolsFilter` class to restrict the available tools. Document the usage of tool filtering in `README.md`. Provide examples of how to configure tool filtering based on different security requirements.
