# Threat Model

## Threat: Exposure of the Werkzeug Debugger in Production

- **Description**: If a Flask application runs with `DEBUG` mode enabled in a production environment, it exposes the interactive Werkzeug Debugger to attackers. An attacker can trigger an unhandled exception and access the debugger's interactive console through the browser, allowing execution of arbitrary Python code on the server.

- **Impact**: Critical - Remote Code Execution leading to complete system compromise.

- **Component Affected**: `app.run()` method and the `debug` configuration in the `Flask` class (`app.py`), potentially enabled via the `FLASK_DEBUG` environment variable.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - Flask provides warnings in the `run()` method documentation and code comments advising against using `app.run()` in production.
  - By default, `debug` mode is disabled unless explicitly enabled by the developer.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Enforce that `DEBUG` mode cannot be enabled when the application is run in a production environment.
  - Provide explicit runtime warnings or errors when the application starts with `debug` mode enabled in a non-development environment.
  - Improve documentation to highlight the risks of enabling `debug` mode in production.

- **Risk Severity**: **Critical**

## Threat: Session Cookie Tampering due to Missing or Weak `SECRET_KEY`

- **Description**: If the `SECRET_KEY` is not set in a Flask application's configuration, or if weak key management practices are used (such as improperly handling key rotation), Flask uses a `NullSession`, which does not cryptographically sign session cookies. This allows attackers to tamper with session data, potentially leading to session hijacking or privilege escalation.

- **Impact**: High - Session Hijacking, User Impersonation, Privilege Escalation.

- **Component Affected**: `SecureCookieSessionInterface` in `sessions.py`, `SECRET_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` configurations in the `Flask` class (`app.py`).

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - The `NullSession` raises a `RuntimeError` when write operations are attempted on the session, indicating that `SECRET_KEY` is not set.
  - Flask's documentation advises developers to set a secure `SECRET_KEY` for sessions and other security-related needs.
  - Flask supports key rotation through the `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` configuration.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Enforce that the application cannot start without a properly configured `SECRET_KEY`.
  - Provide clearer error messages or warnings when `SECRET_KEY` is missing or insecure.
  - Offer tools or commands to help developers generate and securely configure secret keys.
  - Educate developers on proper key rotation practices, including timely removal of old keys from `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Risk Severity**: **High**

## Threat: Host Header Injection due to Unvalidated Host Headers

- **Description**: Flask may accept and use the `Host` header from incoming requests without validation by default. Attackers can manipulate the `Host` header to poison caches, generate incorrect URLs, or bypass virtual host routing, leading to potential information disclosure or request spoofing.

- **Impact**: Medium - Cache Poisoning, Misrouting, Information Disclosure.

- **Component Affected**: `create_url_adapter` method in `app.py`, related to request URL processing and URL generation.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - Flask allows configuring `TRUSTED_HOSTS` to specify valid hostnames for request handling.
  - In Flask 3.1.0, `Request.trusted_hosts` is checked during routing.
  - Developers can implement custom host header validation or use middleware to enforce host header rules.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Provide default validation of `Host` headers against a whitelist or the `SERVER_NAME` configuration.
  - Update documentation to emphasize the importance of validating `Host` headers and configuring `TRUSTED_HOSTS`.
  - Encourage developers to explicitly configure `TRUSTED_HOSTS` to prevent host header attacks.

- **Risk Severity**: **Medium**

---

## Threat: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Insecure Template Rendering

- **Description**: Flask relies on Jinja2 for template rendering, which autoescapes content by default. However, if developers disable autoescaping or improperly use the `|safe` filter, user-supplied input may be rendered without proper sanitization, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

- **Impact**: Medium - Attackers can execute malicious scripts in users' browsers, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or data theft.

- **Component Affected**: Template rendering via Jinja2 in `templating.py`, specifically the `Environment` class and the rendering process.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - Jinja2 autoescapes templates by default for certain file extensions (e.g., `.html`, `.htm`, `.xml`).
  - Flask's documentation encourages safe templating practices and warns against disabling autoescaping.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Provide warnings or errors when autoescaping is disabled in templates or when the `|safe` filter is misused.
  - Offer linters or development tools to detect insecure template usage during development.
  - Enhance documentation with best practices for secure templating and examples of common pitfalls.

- **Risk Severity**: **Medium**

---

## Threat: Information Leakage via Default Error Responses

- **Description**: In debug mode, Flask displays detailed error pages with stack traces and local variable information. If debug mode is enabled in production, this can leak sensitive information about the application's code, configuration, and environment to attackers.

- **Impact**: Medium - Information Disclosure which may aid in further attacks.

- **Component Affected**: Error handling in `handle_exception` and `handle_user_exception` methods in `app.py`.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - Flask disables detailed error pages when `DEBUG` mode is set to `False`, showing generic error messages instead.
  - Developers must explicitly enable `debug` mode; it is not active by default in production environments.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Enforce that `debug` mode cannot be enabled in production environments or when the application is run in a production server.
  - Provide mechanisms for developers to customize error handlers easily, promoting user-friendly and secure error pages.
  - Improve documentation to highlight the risks of enabling `debug` mode and to guide developers on proper error handling.

- **Risk Severity**: **Medium**

---

## Threat: Denial of Service via Unrestricted File Upload Size and Form Data

- **Description**: If `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`, `MAX_FORM_MEMORY_SIZE`, and `MAX_FORM_PARTS` are not set in a Flask application's configuration, the application may accept arbitrarily large request payloads and form submissions. An attacker can submit extremely large files, large form fields, or forms with a large number of parts, which can exhaust server resources like memory or disk space, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).

- **Impact**: High - Denial of Service by resource exhaustion.

- **Component Affected**: Request handling in the `Request` class (`request.py`), particularly around file upload handling and form data processing.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - Flask provides the `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`, `MAX_FORM_MEMORY_SIZE`, and `MAX_FORM_PARTS` configuration options that developers can set to limit the maximum size and complexity of incoming request data.
  - Developers can explicitly set these configurations to reasonable values based on application requirements.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Enforce reasonable default limits for `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`, `MAX_FORM_MEMORY_SIZE`, and `MAX_FORM_PARTS` in Flask to prevent resource exhaustion by default.
  - Provide guidance in documentation emphasizing the importance of setting these configurations when handling file uploads or large form submissions.
  - Encourage developers to validate and handle large or complex requests appropriately.

- **Risk Severity**: **High**

---

## Threat: Weak Secret Key Management Leading to Session Hijacking

- **Description**: Flask supports key rotation with the `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` configuration, allowing multiple secret keys for signing sessions and other data. If old or compromised keys are not removed promptly from the `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`, attackers with access to old secret keys can forge valid session cookies, leading to session hijacking or privilege escalation.

- **Impact**: High - Session Hijacking, User Impersonation, Privilege Escalation.

- **Component Affected**: `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` configuration in the `Flask` class (`app.py`), session management.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - Flask provides support for key rotation through the `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` configuration.
  - Developers can configure multiple keys to allow for seamless key rotation without invalidating existing sessions.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Provide best practices and guidelines for securely managing and rotating secret keys.
  - Encourage developers to remove old keys from `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` after an appropriate period.
  - Implement warnings or reminders to review and update `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` to prevent prolonged use of old keys.
  - Educate developers on the risks associated with improper key rotation.

- **Risk Severity**: **High**

---

## Threat: Misuse of Asynchronous Functionality Leading to Security Vulnerabilities

- **Description**: Flask supports asynchronous views and functions using `async` and `await`. If developers misuse asynchronous features, such as calling blocking code in an async function or using extensions that are not compatible with async, it may lead to unexpected behavior, resource exhaustion, or security vulnerabilities like data leakage or denial of service.

- **Impact**: Medium - Potential for data leakage, application instability, or denial of service.

- **Component Affected**: Asynchronous view functions, extensions, and functions called within async contexts.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - Flask's documentation provides guidelines on the proper use of async functions and cautions about potential issues.
  - Developers are advised that extensions may not be compatible with async code and to check extension documentation.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Encourage extension authors to add support for async functions and provide guidance on how to do so.
  - Provide tooling or warnings to detect misuse of blocking code within async functions.
  - Enhance documentation with best practices for using async features securely.

- **Risk Severity**: **Medium**

---

## Threat: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Due to Lack of Built-in Protection

- **Description**: Flask does not provide built-in protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If developers fail to implement CSRF protection, attackers can forge authenticated requests on behalf of a user, leading to unauthorized actions being performed within the application.

- **Impact**: High - Unauthorized actions, Account Compromise, Data Modification

- **Component Affected**: Forms handling in Flask views and templates (`request.form`, `request.args`), lack of CSRF token generation and validation mechanisms.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - Flask leaves CSRF protection implementation to developers.
  - Developers can use extensions like `Flask-WTF` to add CSRF protection.
  - Documentation mentions CSRF as a potential issue and suggests using extensions.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Provide built-in support for CSRF protection in Flask, such as automatically generating and validating CSRF tokens for form submissions.
  - Enhance documentation to strongly encourage implementation of CSRF protection and guide developers on how to implement it securely.
  - Offer default middleware or decorators to simplify incorporation of CSRF protection.

- **Risk Severity**: **High**

---

## Threat: Lack of Secure Defaults for Security Headers Leading to Various Attacks

- **Description**: Flask does not set important HTTP security headers by default, such as `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, or `Strict-Transport-Security`. The absence of these headers can expose the application to attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Clickjacking, MIME type sniffing, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

- **Impact**: High - Cross-Site Scripting, Clickjacking, Content Injection, Data Theft

- **Component Affected**: HTTP response handling in Flask (`app.py`), default response headers in the Flask response object.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - Developers can manually set security headers in responses within their view functions.
  - Flask's documentation mentions security headers and provides examples of how to set them.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Include secure default headers in Flask's response handling.
  - Provide configuration options or middleware to enable standard security headers easily.
  - Enhance documentation and provide best practice guides on setting security headers and their importance.

- **Risk Severity**: **High**

---

## Threat: Incorrect Handling of Reverse Proxy Headers Due to Missing `ProxyFix` Middleware

- **Description**: When Flask applications are deployed behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache), the application may not correctly interpret client IP addresses, protocol (HTTP/HTTPS), and host headers unless the `ProxyFix` middleware is configured. Attackers could exploit this misconfiguration to spoof client IP addresses, bypass IP-based access controls, or cause improper URL generation and security policy enforcement.

- **Impact**: Medium - Client Spoofing, Access Control Bypass, Session Hijacking, Improper Redirection

- **Component Affected**: WSGI middleware configuration (`werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix.ProxyFix`), Flask's `request` object properties like `remote_addr`, `url_scheme`, `host`.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - Flask's documentation advises on the need to use `ProxyFix` middleware when deploying behind a proxy.
  - Developers can add and configure `ProxyFix` manually in their application.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Provide better guidance or automated tools for detecting when an application is behind a proxy and needs `ProxyFix`.
  - Include default middleware for common deployment configurations or issue warnings when `ProxyFix` might be required.
  - Enhance documentation with deployment best practices, emphasizing the importance of proper proxy handling.

- **Risk Severity**: **Medium**

---

## Threat: Privilege Escalation Due to Running Flask Application as Root User

- **Description**: Running a Flask application as the root user can lead to privilege escalation if the application or its dependencies are compromised. An attacker exploiting a vulnerability in the application could gain root access to the server, leading to complete system takeover, data breaches, or persistent malware installation.

- **Impact**: Critical - Full System Compromise, Data Theft, Service Disruption, Persistent Malware

- **Component Affected**: Deployment configurations and web server setup when running the Flask application in production (`app.run()` or WSGI server configurations).

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - Flask's documentation warns against running the application as root.
  - Recommendations are provided to run applications as a non-privileged user and use a reverse proxy for port binding.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Enforce that Flask's built-in development server refuses to run as root, or at least shows a critical warning.
  - Provide clear errors or warnings if the application is started with root privileges.
  - Enhance documentation with deployment guides emphasizing the need to run as non-root and provide best practices for privilege separation.

- **Risk Severity**: **Critical**

---

## Threat: Directory Traversal and Arbitrary File Overwrite via Unsafe File Names in File Uploads

- **Description**: If Flask applications accept file uploads and save files using user-supplied filenames without proper sanitization, an attacker could craft filenames containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to write files outside of the intended directory. This could lead to overwriting critical files, including application code or configuration, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.

- **Impact**: High - Arbitrary File Write, Code Execution, Denial of Service

- **Component Affected**: View functions handling file uploads, use of `save` method in `werkzeug.datastructures.FileStorage`, improper usage of `secure_filename`.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - Flask (through Werkzeug) provides the `secure_filename` function to sanitize filenames.
  - Documentation advises developers to use `secure_filename` when handling file uploads.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Enforce or automatically apply `secure_filename` to all uploaded filenames by default.
  - Provide higher-level file upload handling utilities that ensure filenames are safe.
  - Educate developers on the importance of sanitizing filenames and the risks associated with unsanitized input.

- **Risk Severity**: **High**

---

## Threat: HTTP Method Override Abuse Leading to Bypassing Security Controls

- **Description**: Some Flask applications may implement HTTP method override functionality, allowing clients to specify the actual HTTP method through headers like `X-HTTP-Method-Override`. If not properly secured, an attacker can exploit this to change the request method, potentially bypassing method-based security restrictions (e.g., changing a safe GET request into a state-changing DELETE request).

- **Impact**: Medium - Authorization Bypass, CSRF Attack Facilitation, Unintended State Changes

- **Component Affected**: Custom middleware or code that handles HTTP method overrides, view functions relying on the request method.

- **Current Mitigations**:
  - Flask does not natively support method overriding; it's implemented manually by developers.
  - The documentation provides an example of how to implement method overriding securely.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Provide a built-in, secure method override middleware that includes safeguards, such as validating the origin of the request.
  - Educate developers on the risks associated with method override and how to implement it securely, including client-side restrictions.
  - Encourage using method overriding only when necessary and with proper validation.

- **Risk Severity**: **Medium**
