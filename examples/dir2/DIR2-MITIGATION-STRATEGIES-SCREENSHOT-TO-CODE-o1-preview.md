### 5. Limit AI Model Outputs

- **Description**:
  1. Enable and configure safety features provided by AI services (e.g., OpenAI's content filters).
     - Set appropriate parameters in API calls to enforce content policies.
  2. Post-process AI outputs to detect and remove potentially malicious code.
     - Implement checks for disallowed code patterns or functions.

- **List of Threats Mitigated**:
  - Malicious code generation by AI models (**Medium Severity**)

- **Impact**:
  - Reduces the risk of harmful code being introduced through AI outputs.

- **Currently Implemented**:
  - **Not implemented**. There is no indication of output filtering or safety configurations in API calls within the codebase.

- **Missing Implementation**:
  - Update AI service interactions to include safety parameters.
  - Add post-processing steps to sanitize AI model outputs before use.
