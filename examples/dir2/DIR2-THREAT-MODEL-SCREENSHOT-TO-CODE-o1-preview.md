### Threat: Exposure of API Keys and Secrets in Environment Variables or Code

- **Description:** The application relies on sensitive API keys (e.g., OpenAI API key, Anthropic API key) stored in environment variables and configuration files. If these keys are not securely managed (e.g., accidentally committed to the repository or exposed through logs), an attacker could obtain them and misuse the associated services, leading to unauthorized actions or financial loss.

- **Impact:** Unauthorized access and misuse of API keys, leading to financial loss, service abuse, or exposure of additional sensitive information.

- **Affected Component:** Backend configuration files (e.g., `.env`), code that loads API keys (e.g., `backend/config.py`), and scripts utilizing these keys.

- **Current Mitigations:** The project uses environment variables to store API keys and provides guidance on setting up `.env` files. There may be documentation advising against committing these files to version control.

- **Missing Mitigations:** Ensure `.env` and other sensitive files are included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits. Implement automated scans and code reviews to detect secrets in the codebase. Use secure secrets management solutions for production environments.

- **Risk Severity:** High

### Threat: Lack of Authentication and Authorization on API Endpoints

- **Description:** The backend FastAPI application exposes several API endpoints (e.g., `/generate-code`, `/api/screenshot`) without enforcing authentication or authorization. This allows unauthorized users to access and utilize the application's functionality, potentially leading to misuse or resource exhaustion.

- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to application functionalities, potential abuse of resources, increased operational costs, and exposure of sensitive operations.

- **Affected Component:** Backend API endpoints defined in `backend/routes/generate_code.py`, `backend/routes/screenshot.py`, and `backend/main.py`.

- **Current Mitigations:** None observed in the codebase; no authentication mechanisms are implemented.

- **Missing Mitigations:** Implement authentication and authorization for all API endpoints. Use secure methods like OAuth tokens or API keys to restrict access. Apply role-based access controls and ensure sensitive endpoints are protected. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

- **Risk Severity:** High

### Threat: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via User-Supplied URLs in Screenshot Functionality

- **Description:** The `/api/screenshot` endpoint allows users to supply arbitrary URLs to capture screenshots. Without proper validation, an attacker can submit internal or local URLs (e.g., `http://localhost`, `http://169.254.169.254`) to access internal services or metadata, potentially leading to SSRF attacks.

- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal network resources, data leakage, potential for further network exploitation.

- **Affected Component:** Backend route `backend/routes/screenshot.py` handling screenshot requests based on user-supplied URLs.

- **Current Mitigations:** No input validation or URL sanitization observed in the provided code.

- **Missing Mitigations:** Implement strict input validation for user-supplied URLs. Use an allowlist of permitted domains or block access to private IP ranges and localhost addresses. Employ SSRF protection libraries or services to sanitize requests.

- **Risk Severity:** High

---

### Threat: Denial of Service (DoS) Through Unbounded Resource Consumption

- **Description:** The application performs resource-intensive operations like code generation and image processing based on user inputs. Without limitations on input size or frequency, an attacker could submit large or numerous requests, consuming excessive CPU, memory, or network resources, leading to service degradation or outages.

- **Impact:** Service unavailability or degradation, impacting legitimate users and potentially increasing operational costs.

- **Affected Component:** Backend services in `backend/main.py`, `backend/routes/*`, and functions processing large inputs without size restrictions.

- **Current Mitigations:** No input size validation or rate limiting mechanisms observed.

- **Missing Mitigations:** Implement input validation to enforce size and complexity limits on user inputs. Apply rate limiting and request throttling to mitigate excessive usage. Monitor resource utilization and consider auto-scaling strategies or protective measures like circuit breakers.

- **Risk Severity:** Medium

---

### Threat: Command Injection via Parameters Passed to External Commands

- **Description:** The application uses `subprocess.run` to execute external commands (e.g., `osascript` in `video/utils.py`). If user input is passed directly to these commands without sanitization, it could lead to command injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

- **Impact:** Full system compromise, unauthorized access to server resources, data theft, or further network penetration.

- **Affected Component:** The `backend/video/utils.py` module where `subprocess.run` is invoked.

- **Current Mitigations:** Currently, user input does not appear to be directly passed to shell commands, but there may be insufficient checks to prevent future vulnerabilities.

- **Missing Mitigations:** Ensure no user input is used in command execution without thorough sanitization. Use parameterized functions and avoid shell=True in subprocess calls. Validate and escape all inputs passed to external commands.

- **Risk Severity:** High

---

### Threat: Insecure Handling of Untrusted Input in Image Processing

- **Description:** The application processes user-uploaded images using libraries like Pillow (`backend/image_processing/utils.py`). Maliciously crafted images could exploit vulnerabilities in image parsing libraries, leading to application crashes or remote code execution.

- **Impact:** Denial of service through application crashes, potential execution of arbitrary code, and server compromise.

- **Affected Component:** Image processing functions in `backend/image_processing/utils.py`.

- **Current Mitigations:** No input validation or sanitization observed; the application processes images directly.

- **Missing Mitigations:** Implement input validation and sanitization for image files. Use secure image processing practices, such as processing images in isolated environments (e.g., containers or sandboxes). Keep image processing libraries updated to incorporate security patches.

- **Risk Severity:** Medium

---

### Threat: Inclusion of Vulnerable Third-Party Dependencies

- **Description:** The application relies on third-party packages (e.g., `httpx`, `aiohttp`, `fastapi`) specified in `pyproject.toml`. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities and are not regularly updated, they can introduce security risks into the application.

- **Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service, or remote code execution.

- **Affected Component:** Dependency management in `backend/pyproject.toml`.

- **Current Mitigations:** Dependencies are declared with version ranges, but there's no indication of proactive vulnerability scanning or updates.

- **Missing Mitigations:** Implement a process for regular dependency updates. Use tools like `pip-audit` or `safety` to scan for known vulnerabilities. Adopt dependency management practices that ensure timely application of security patches.

- **Risk Severity:** Medium

---

### Threat: Logging of Sensitive Data in Debug Logs or Error Messages

- **Description:** The application's debug logs or error messages may inadvertently include sensitive information such as API keys, user inputs, or detailed system information. If logs are accessed by unauthorized parties, this could lead to exposure of secrets or aid in further attacks.

- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, facilitating further attacks like credential theft or service impersonation.

- **Affected Component:** Logging functionality in `backend/fs_logging/core.py` and other areas where logging occurs without sanitization.

- **Current Mitigations:** No specific measures observed to prevent sensitive data from being logged.

- **Missing Mitigations:** Review logging practices to ensure sensitive data is not recorded. Implement log sanitization to mask or exclude sensitive information. Limit log access to authorized personnel and secure log storage.

- **Risk Severity:** Medium

---

### Threat: Generation and Execution of Malicious Code via LLM Prompt Injection

- **Description:** The application uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code based on user-supplied inputs. Attackers could craft inputs (e.g., specially designed images or text) that manipulate the LLM into producing malicious code. When this code is executed on the client side, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks or other malicious actions.

- **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code in users' browsers, data theft, session hijacking, or compromise of user accounts.

- **Affected Component:** Code generation logic in `backend/routes/generate_code.py`, LLM interactions in `backend/llm.py`, and frontend code execution environments.

- **Current Mitigations:** No mechanisms observed to detect or prevent malicious code generation or execution resulting from prompt injection.

- **Missing Mitigations:** Implement validation and sanitization of generated code before it's served to clients. Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to limit the execution of untrusted scripts. Employ sandboxed execution environments (e.g., iframe sandboxes) to isolate executed code. Monitor and restrict LLM outputs that deviate from expected patterns.

- **Risk Severity:** Critical

---

### Threat: Lack of Rate Limiting on API Endpoints

- **Description:** The application does not implement rate limiting on its API endpoints. This omission allows attackers to perform brute-force attacks, overwhelm the server with requests (leading to denial of service), or exploit other rate-based vulnerabilities.

- **Impact:** Service disruption affecting all users, potential unauthorized access through brute-force attacks, increased operational costs due to resource overuse.

- **Affected Component:** Backend API endpoints across `backend/routes/*.py` and `backend/main.py`.

- **Current Mitigations:** No rate limiting or request throttling mechanisms observed.

- **Missing Mitigations:** Implement rate limiting to control the number of requests a user can make in a given timeframe. Use middleware or API gateways to enforce these limits. Monitor traffic patterns to detect and respond to unusual activity.

- **Risk Severity:** Medium

---

### Threat: Unhandled Exceptions Leading to Information Disclosure

- **Description:** The application may not adequately handle exceptions, potentially returning stack traces or error details to the user. This can disclose sensitive information about the application's internal workings, aiding attackers in crafting targeted attacks.

- **Impact:** Exposure of internal application structures, facilitating targeted exploits or attacks.

- **Affected Component:** Exception handling in `backend/main.py` and throughout the backend routes.

- **Current Mitigations:** No comprehensive exception handling observed; detailed errors may be returned in responses.

- **Missing Mitigations:** Implement global exception handlers to catch and appropriately respond to unexpected errors. Return generic error messages to users while logging detailed information internally. Ensure that debug information is not exposed in production environments.

- **Risk Severity:** Medium
