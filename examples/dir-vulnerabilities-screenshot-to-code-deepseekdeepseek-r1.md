**VULNERABILITIES**

1. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Screenshot Endpoint**
- **Description**: The `/api/screenshot` endpoint in `screenshot.py` accepts arbitrary URLs without validation. Attackers can make the server request internal resources by manipulating the `url` parameter (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data` for AWS metadata harvesting).
- **Impact**: Potential exposure of internal network services, cloud metadata, or sensitive internal applications.
- **Rank**: Critical
- **Current Mitigations**: None - URL validation is completely absent in the request processing flow.
- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Allowlist of permitted domains
  - Block internal IP ranges and metadata endpoints
  - URL schema validation (allow only HTTP/HTTPS)
- **Preconditions**: Attacker needs valid API key for screenshot service (but could use compromised keys).
- **Source Code Analysis**:
  ```python
  # backend/routes/screenshot.py
  async def capture_screenshot(target_url: str, api_key: str, ...):
      # No validation of target_url
      params = {"url": target_url, ...}  # Directly used in API call
      response = await client.get(api_base_url, params=params)
  ```
- **Security Test Case**:
  1. Send POST to `/api/screenshot` with `{"url": "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data", "apiKey": "valid-key"}`
  2. Observe server attempts to access AWS metadata endpoint
  3. Check response for sensitive internal data

2. **Insecure CORS Configuration** (Existing)
- **Description**: The backend explicitly allows all origins (`allow_origins=["*"]`) in `main.py`. This enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing from any domain, making the API vulnerable to CSRF attacks and cross-origin attacks.
- **Impact**: Attackers could make unauthorized requests from malicious domains to compromise user data or perform actions on behalf of users.
- **Rank**: High
- **Current Mitigations**: None implemented. The CORS middleware is configured with permissive settings.
- **Missing Mitigations**: Origin whitelisting, proper CORS policy configuration with specific allowed origins.
- **Preconditions**: Attacker needs to lure a user to a malicious website that makes cross-origin requests to the application.
- **Source Code Analysis**:
  ```python
  # backend/main.py
  app.add_middleware(
      CORSMiddleware,
      allow_origins=["*"],  # Dangerous wildcard
      allow_credentials=True,
      allow_methods=["*"],
      allow_headers=["*"]
  )
  ```
- **Security Test Case**:
  1. Create a malicious HTML page on another domain
  2. Make AJAX POST request to `http://localhost:7001/generate-code`
  3. Observe successful response despite cross-origin request

3. **XSS Risk in AI-Generated HTML Output** (Existing)
- **Description**: The system generates HTML code containing unescaped user-controlled content (from screenshot text) and includes jQuery without content security policies.
- **Impact**: If generated HTML contains malicious scripts, they would execute in users' browsers when viewing the output.
- **Rank**: High
- **Current Mitigations**: No output sanitization visible in code generation flows.
- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - HTML escaping of dynamic content
  - Content Security Policy headers
  - Safe DOM manipulation practices
- **Preconditions**: Attacker provides screenshot containing malicious text content that gets converted into executable JS code.
- **Source Code Analysis**:
  ```python
  # backend/mock_llm.py
  NYTIMES_MOCK_CODE = """
  <body class="bg-gray-100">
    <!-- No XSS protection in text content -->
  ```
- **Security Test Case**:
  1. Create screenshot containing text: `</div><script>alert(1)</script>`
  2. Process through the AI generator
  3. Observe script execution in rendered output

4. **Image Processing Vulnerabilities** (Existing)
- **Description**: The image processing utils (`image_processing/utils.py`) accept arbitrary base64-encoded images without proper validation of the decoded content.
- **Impact**: Potential for DoS via malformed images or hidden exploit code in image metadata.
- **Rank**: Medium
- **Current Mitigations**: Basic resizing and format conversion for Claude compatibility.
- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Magic number validation for image formats
  - Size limitations before decoding
  - EXIF data sanitization
- **Preconditions**: Attacker uploads a specially crafted image file with embedded malicious content.
- **Source Code Analysis**:
  ```python
  # backend/image_processing/utils.py
  def process_image(image_data_url: str):
      image_bytes = base64.b64decode(base64_data)  # Direct decode without checks
  ```
- **Security Test Case**:
  1. Create polyglot file with image header and embedded HTML
  2. Encode as base64 and submit via API
  3. Verify server processes the file without validation

5. **API Key Exposure Risk** (Existing)
- **Description**: API keys are stored in environment variables without encryption and exposed in debug logs/error messages.
- **Impact**: Compromise of cloud AI service accounts leading to financial loss and data leakage.
- **Rank**: Medium
- **Current Mitigations**: Basic environment variable storage.
- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Secure credential storage with encryption
  - Key rotation mechanisms
  - Audit trails for key usage
- **Preconditions**: Attacker gains access to server environment or intercepts unsecured logs.
- **Source Code Analysis**:
  ```python
  # backend/llm.py
  async def stream_openai_response(...):
      print(f"Using OpenAI key: {api_key}")  # Key exposure in logs
  ```
- **Security Test Case**:
  1. Force error in OpenAI API call
  2. Check error logs for API key presence
  3. Verify keys are exposed in stack traces

6. **Insecure Defaults in Docker Configuration** (Existing)
- **Description**: The docker-compose.yml exposes backend port 7001 and frontend port 5173 without authentication requirements.
- **Impact**: Unauthenticated access to internal APIs if deployed to public cloud.
- **Rank**: Medium
- **Current Mitigations**: None - assumes local development environment.
- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - Network segmentation
  - Authentication requirements
  - Production-ready configuration
- **Preconditions**: Deployment to publicly accessible cloud environment without firewall rules.
- **Source Code Analysis**:
  ```yaml
  # docker-compose.yml
  services:
    backend:
      ports:
        - "7001:7001"
  ```
- **Security Test Case**:
  1. Deploy to cloud provider with public IP
  2. Access `http://<public-ip>:7001/docs` directly
  3. Verify API documentation is publicly accessible

**Note**: The SSRF vulnerability was added based on analysis of the new screenshot endpoint code. Existing vulnerabilities remain valid as no mitigations were found in the updated project files.
