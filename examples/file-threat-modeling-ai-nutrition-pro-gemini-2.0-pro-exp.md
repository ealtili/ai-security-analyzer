## AI Nutrition-Pro Threat Model

Below is a list of potential threats to the AI Nutrition-Pro application, focusing on those introduced by its specific design and functionality.

*   **Threat:** Prompt Injection leading to Unintended LLM Behavior
    *   **Description:** An attacker, potentially through a compromised Meal Planner application or by crafting malicious input if the Meal Planner app doesn't sanitize user inputs, sends specially crafted dietitian content samples or other inputs. These inputs are then used to construct prompts for ChatGPT. The malicious prompts could cause ChatGPT to ignore previous instructions, generate inappropriate content (e.g., harmful advice, offensive text), reveal its underlying prompt structure, or execute unintended actions if the LLM has such capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Generation of incorrect or harmful nutritional advice, reputational damage for AI Nutrition-Pro and its clients, delivery of malicious content to end-users via Meal Planner, potential for service disruption if the LLM API has strict content policies.
    *   **Which AI Nutrition-Pro component is affected:** AI Nutrition-Pro Backend API (prompt construction), AI Nutrition-Pro API Gateway (if it fails to filter malicious patterns). Indirectly affects ChatGPT.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** The API Gateway is described as providing "filtering of input". However, the effectiveness of this filtering against sophisticated prompt injection techniques is not specified and might be limited.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and validation specifically for LLM prompt construction within the AI Nutrition-Pro Backend API.
        *   Utilize prompt engineering techniques to make prompts more resilient (e.g., instruction defense, input/output fencing, delimiters).
        *   Clearly define and enforce content boundaries for inputs received from Meal Planner applications.
        *   Monitor LLM outputs for anomalies, malicious content patterns, or deviations from expected behavior.
        *   Consider implementing an allow-list for prompt structures or parameters if feasible.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Leakage via LLM Prompts
    *   **Description:** Dietitians, through the Meal Planner application, upload content samples. If these samples inadvertently contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), or other sensitive business data, this data will be sent from the AI Nutrition-Pro Backend API to ChatGPT. This data could be retained by the LLM provider or exposed if the LLM service itself has a vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Breach of privacy, regulatory fines (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA if applicable), loss of user trust for AI Nutrition-Pro and Meal Planner applications, leakage of intellectual property.
    *   **Which AI Nutrition-Pro component is affected:** AI Nutrition-Pro Backend API (sending data to LLM), AI Nutrition-Pro API database (storing samples that might contain sensitive data). Indirectly affects the Meal Planner application as the source of data.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** Network traffic to ChatGPT is via HTTPS/REST, providing in-transit encryption. No specific mitigations mentioned for preventing sensitive data within the samples themselves.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement strict data minimization: only send necessary, non-sensitive data elements to the LLM.
        *   Provide clear guidelines and warnings to Meal Planner applications (and their dietitian users) about not including sensitive PII/PHI in content samples.
        *   Implement PII/PHI detection and redaction mechanisms in the AI Nutrition-Pro Backend API before sending data to ChatGPT.
        *   Review OpenAI's data usage and privacy policies; configure API usage to maximize privacy if options exist (e.g., opt-out of data retention for model training).
        *   Anonymize or pseudonymize data where possible before it's processed by the Backend API for LLM interaction.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Generation of Inaccurate or Harmful Nutritional Advice by LLM
    *   **Description:** ChatGPT, as a general-purpose LLM, can "hallucinate" or generate factually incorrect, biased, or even harmful nutritional advice. The AI Nutrition-Pro system relies on these outputs to provide value.
    *   **Impact:** Direct harm to end-users relying on the AI-generated advice, legal liability for AI Nutrition-Pro and Meal Planner applications, significant reputational damage.
    *   **Which AI Nutrition-Pro component is affected:** AI Nutrition-Pro Backend API (relaying LLM output). Indirectly affects ChatGPT as the source and Meal Planner applications as presenters of the advice.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** None explicitly mentioned in the design to verify or ensure the accuracy of LLM-generated nutritional content.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Clearly disclaim to Meal Planner applications (and subsequently to end-users) that the generated content is AI-assisted and must be reviewed by a qualified dietitian before use.
        *   Recommend or implement mechanisms for human review and approval of LLM-generated content within the Meal Planner applications or as a feature of AI Nutrition-Pro.
        *   Fine-tune prompts sent by the AI Nutrition-Pro Backend API to guide the LLM towards generating safer, evidence-based, and more accurate content (e.g., instructing it to cite sources, adhere to specific dietary guidelines, or express uncertainty).
        *   Incorporate feedback loops where dietitians can rate or correct generated content, allowing AI Nutrition-Pro to refine its prompting strategies.
        *   Maintain and use high-quality, curated dietitian content samples to provide better context to the LLM.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** API Key Compromise for Meal Planner Application
    *   **Description:** Each Meal Planner application authenticates using an individual API key. If an API key is stolen or leaked from a Meal Planner application, an attacker can impersonate that application to make unauthorized requests to the AI Nutrition-Pro API Gateway.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized use of the AI Nutrition-Pro API (potentially incurring costs), submission of malicious data for LLM processing under a legitimate identity, access to or manipulation of data associated with the compromised Meal Planner's account, denial of service for the legitimate Meal Planner due to rate limiting or quota exhaustion.
    *   **Which AI Nutrition-Pro component is affected:** AI Nutrition-Pro API Gateway (authentication mechanism), AI Nutrition-Pro Backend API (processing unauthorized requests).
    *   **Current Mitigations:** Individual API keys are used for authentication. The API Gateway handles authentication and has ACL rules.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement robust API key management practices within AI Nutrition-Pro: secure generation, storage (e.g., hashed in the Control Plane DB), and rotation of API keys.
        *   Provide clear security guidelines to developers of Meal Planner applications on securely storing and handling API keys on their end.
        *   Monitor API usage within AI Nutrition-Pro for anomalous patterns (e.g., sudden spikes in requests, requests from unusual IP ranges for a given key) that might indicate a compromised key.
        *   Implement mechanisms for easy revocation and regeneration of API keys via the Web Control Plane.
        *   Consider IP whitelisting for API keys if Meal Planner applications have static IPs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Insufficient Authorization Controls or Privilege Escalation in Web Control Plane
    *   **Description:** The AI Nutrition-Pro Web Control Plane serves multiple roles (Administrator, App Onboarding Manager, Meal Planner application manager). Flaws in authorization logic could allow a user with lower privileges to access or modify functionalities or data restricted to higher-privileged roles, or data belonging to other tenants.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized configuration changes to AI Nutrition-Pro, data breaches (e.g., exposure of billing data, other tenants' configurations), ability to manage other Meal Planner applications without authorization, system instability.
    *   **Which AI Nutrition-Pro component is affected:** AI Nutrition-Pro Web Control Plane, AI Nutrition-Pro Control Plane Database (data exposure/modification).
    *   **Current Mitigations:** Role-based access is implied by the description of different user roles.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement and enforce strict, granular role-based access control (RBAC) with the principle of least privilege for all functionalities and data access within the Web Control Plane.
        *   Thoroughly test authorization logic, including checks for Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), vertical and horizontal privilege escalation.
        *   Regularly audit access logs for the Web Control Plane, focusing on actions performed by privileged users.
        *   Ensure strong separation of duties between the defined roles.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium

*   **Threat:** Inadequate Sanitization of Dietitian Content Samples Leading to Stored Injection Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Dietitian content samples are uploaded by Meal Planner applications and stored in the AI Nutrition-Pro API database. If these samples are not properly sanitized by the Backend API before storage or before being displayed/used elsewhere (e.g., an admin interface viewing raw samples), they could contain malicious payloads (e.g., XSS if displayed in a web context, or other injection types if used insecurely).
    *   **Impact:** If displayed in an admin UI for AI Nutrition-Pro without proper encoding, could lead to XSS compromising an admin session. Data corruption in the API database. Potential for misuse if other internal systems consume this data raw.
    *   **Which AI Nutrition-Pro component is affected:** AI Nutrition-Pro API Application (when processing/storing samples), AI Nutrition-Pro API database (storing potentially malicious data).
    *   **Current Mitigations:** API Gateway provides "filtering of input," but its scope and effectiveness for content destined for storage (not just LLM prompts) are unclear.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the dietitian content samples specifically within the AI Nutrition-Pro Backend API before storing them in the API database. Focus on preventing common injection payloads.
        *   Use output encoding whenever these samples are displayed or used in other contexts (e.g., an admin interface for AI Nutrition-Pro).
        *   Utilize parameterized queries or Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) correctly when interacting with the API database to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium

*   **Threat:** Over-reliance on External LLM Availability (ChatGPT)
    *   **Description:** The core AI content generation functionality of AI Nutrition-Pro is entirely dependent on the availability, performance, and policies of the external ChatGPT-3.5 API. Outages, significant changes in API behavior, rate limiting, or deprecation by OpenAI can directly cripple AI Nutrition-Pro's service.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption or complete unavailability of AI Nutrition-Pro's core features, leading to frustrated users (Meal Planner applications and their end-users) and potential loss of business for AI Nutrition-Pro.
    *   **Which AI Nutrition-Pro component is affected:** AI Nutrition-Pro Backend API (cannot fulfill requests), and thus the entire AI Nutrition-Pro service offering.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** None explicitly mentioned for handling external dependency failures.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement robust error handling, retries with exponential backoff, and circuit breaker patterns in the AI Nutrition-Pro Backend API when interacting with the ChatGPT API.
        *   Cache LLM responses where appropriate and feasible (considering data freshness, context uniqueness, and cost) to reduce reliance on real-time API calls for identical or similar requests.
        *   Develop and maintain a clear incident response plan for AI Nutrition-Pro to handle ChatGPT outages or major issues.
        *   Clearly communicate the dependency on ChatGPT and any associated SLAs (or lack thereof from OpenAI) to Meal Planner applications.
        *   (Long-term strategy) Explore options for fallback LLMs or alternative content generation strategies if the primary LLM becomes unreliable or too costly.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium

*   **Threat:** Insufficient Tenant Data Isolation in Databases
    *   **Description:** The AI Nutrition-Pro Control Plane Database (storing tenant configurations, billing) and API Database (storing dietitian's content samples, LLM I/O) handle data for multiple Meal Planner applications (tenants). Flaws in application logic or database queries within the Web Control Plane or Backend API could lead to one tenant accessing or modifying data belonging to another.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach of sensitive tenant information (configurations, billing details, proprietary content samples), loss of confidentiality and integrity, violation of privacy agreements, significant loss of customer trust for AI Nutrition-Pro.
    *   **Which AI Nutrition-Pro component is affected:** AI Nutrition-Pro Web Control Plane (for Control Plane DB access logic), AI Nutrition-Pro Backend API (for API DB access logic), AI Nutrition-Pro Control Plane Database, AI Nutrition-Pro API Database.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** Not explicitly detailed, but multi-tenancy implies an intention for isolation. TLS is used for database connections.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement robust tenant isolation at all layers of AI Nutrition-Pro: ensure application logic in the Web Control Plane and Backend API strictly enforces data boundaries using tenant identifiers in all queries and operations.
        *   Use database mechanisms to enforce isolation if possible (e.g., row-level security, separate schemas per tenant if scalable).
        *   Conduct thorough testing, including penetration testing, specifically focused on identifying and exploiting any tenant isolation bypass vulnerabilities in AI Nutrition-Pro.
        *   Regularly audit data access patterns and database configurations to ensure ongoing isolation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Compromise of Administrator Credentials for AI Nutrition-Pro Web Control Plane
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the credentials of an Administrator for the AI Nutrition-Pro Web Control Plane through methods like phishing, malware on an admin's workstation, weak or reused passwords, or social engineering.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the AI Nutrition-Pro application's configuration, ability to manage (add/remove/modify) tenants and their API keys, access sensitive billing data, potentially disrupt service for all clients, exfiltrate data from the Control Plane Database, or use admin access to launch further attacks.
    *   **Which AI Nutrition-Pro component is affected:** AI Nutrition-Pro Web Control Plane, AI Nutrition-Pro Control Plane Database.
    *   **Current Mitigations:** None explicitly mentioned regarding specific security measures for Administrator accounts.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Enforce strong, unique password policies for all Administrator accounts on the AI Nutrition-Pro Web Control Plane.
        *   Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) as a mandatory requirement for all Administrator access.
        *   Limit the number of Administrator accounts to the absolute minimum necessary.
        *   Monitor Administrator activity within the Web Control Plane for suspicious behavior or unauthorized changes.
        *   Regularly review Administrator access rights and accounts.
        *   Educate administrators on secure credential management and phishing awareness.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Inadequate Logging and Monitoring of Security Events across AI Nutrition-Pro
    *   **Description:** If the AI Nutrition-Pro components (API Gateway, Web Control Plane, Backend API) do not generate sufficient, detailed security logs, or if these logs are not effectively centralized, monitored, and alerted upon, detecting and responding to security incidents becomes significantly delayed or impossible.
    *   **Impact:** Delayed or no detection of attacks (e.g., ongoing prompt injection attempts, API key abuse, unauthorized access attempts to Web Control Plane), inability to perform effective forensic analysis after an incident, leading to increased damage and difficulty in remediation.
    *   **Which AI Nutrition-Pro component is affected:** All AI Nutrition-Pro components (API Gateway, Web Control Plane, Backend API, Databases).
    *   **Current Mitigations:** Not explicitly mentioned in the provided architecture document.
    *   **Missing Mitigations:**
        *   Implement comprehensive logging for all critical actions, authentication events (successes and failures), authorization failures, errors, input validation failures, and suspicious activities across all AI Nutrition-Pro components.
        *   Centralize logs from all AI Nutrition-Pro components into a dedicated log management or Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.
        *   Define and configure alerts for critical security events (e.g., multiple failed logins, signs of prompt injection, unusual API traffic patterns).
        *   Regularly review logs and audit trails as part of security operations.
        *   Ensure logs are protected from tampering and retained according to a defined policy that meets security and compliance needs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium (Severity increases if other controls are weak or incidents are more likely)
