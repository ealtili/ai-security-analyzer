## 1. Understand the Project

**Project Name:** AI Nutrition-Pro

### Overview

AI Nutrition-Pro is composed of multiple components (containers) orchestrated in AWS Elastic Container Service. The solution provides AI-assisted nutritional content for Meal Planner applications. Key highlights:

- **API Gateway (Kong):** Handles authentication, rate limiting, input filtering.
- **Web Control Plane (Golang):** Manages system configuration, client onboarding, and billing data.
- **Control Plane Database (Amazon RDS):** Stores administrative, client, and billing data.
- **API Application (Golang):** Main engine for receiving content samples and generating AI-based nutritional content (integrating with ChatGPT).
- **API Database (Amazon RDS):** Stores dietitians’ content samples, AI request/response logs.
- **ChatGPT-3.5 (External):** LLM used to generate nutritional content.

### Typical Use Cases

1. **Meal Planner applications**:
   - Upload nutrition-related content or diet suggestions to AI Nutrition-Pro.
   - Fetch AI-generated content to create or enhance meal plans.

2. **Administrator**:
   - Configures system settings and manages internal aspects of AI Nutrition-Pro.
   - Manages onboarding of new clients and checks billing data.

### Key Components and Their Roles
1. **API Gateway (Kong)** – front door for all inbound calls from Meal Planner apps.
2. **Web Control Plane** – internal web application for administration and control.
3. **API Application** – the core functionality to generate content using ChatGPT.
4. **Databases (RDS)** – store meal planner data, user data, billing data, and AI content logs.

### Dependencies
- **Kong** (API Gateway)
- **Golang** runtime in AWS ECS
- **Amazon RDS**
- **ChatGPT-3.5** external LLM

## 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

- **Highest Risk Paths**
  - **Bypassing API Authentication (1.1)**: Could allow direct unauthorized access to the AI functionality.
  - **Hijacking Administrator Credentials (2.1)**: An attacker with admin control would have a broad impact.
  - **Database Injection (4.1)**: Could lead to data compromise or corruption of vital system records.

- **Critical Nodes**
  1. **(1.1.2) Use leaked/brute-forced API key:** Exposes the entire API surface.
  2. **(2.2.1) Injection in Web Control Plane:** Potential direct RCE or data tampering.
  3. **(3.1.1) Prompt injection attacks:** Could subvert the AI logic and lead to data disclosure.
  4. **(4.2.2) Access billing/client info:** Liability concerns, privacy issues, reputational harm.

The combination of high impact and moderate likelihood in these nodes makes them top priorities.

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies

> **Note**: The following security controls focus on issues specifically introduced by AI Nutrition-Pro’s architecture and design. They exclude generic best practices such as logging, hardening, patching, or standard monitoring steps.

1. **API Gateway Protections**
   - Validate strict ACL policies for each route/sub-route.
   - Enforce per-client API keys with strong rotation policies.
   - Strengthen request filtering to handle suspicious payloads.

2. **Web Control Plane Security**
   - Implement robust password policies and MFA for administrators.
   - Harden input validation to prevent injection attacks.
   - Use role-based access with least privilege to reduce lateral movement.

3. **API Application and LLM Integration Controls**
   - Sanitize prompts submitted to ChatGPT to reduce injection attacks.
   - Encrypt or sign responses from ChatGPT to detect tampering.
   - Validate ECS configurations to prevent unauthorized container access.

4. **Database Safeguards**
   - Deploy parameterized queries to mitigate SQL injection.
   - Strict IAM role separation for RDS to limit data access.
   - Implement row- or column-level encryption if feasible for sensitive fields.

---

## 9. Summarize Findings

1. **Key Risks Identified**
   - Inadequate API Gateway configuration could expose the system to direct attacks.
   - Web Control Plane vulnerabilities (injection, credential attacks) risk full platform compromise.
   - API Application manipulations, especially with LLM prompts, can lead to data leakage or content corruption.
   - Database misconfigurations or injection paths can jeopardize massive amounts of sensitive data.

2. **Recommended Actions**
   - Restrict and monitor API access with strong authentication and key rotation.
   - Adopt safe coding practices on Web Control Plane to prevent injection and enforce least privilege.
   - Sanitize and verify data exchanged with ChatGPT, especially for AI logic.
   - Remediate any misconfigurations in RDS and ECS that could allow privilege escalation or data exfiltration.

---

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

1. **Questions**
   1. Does the system employ any code signing or integrity checks for container images?
   2. Are environment variables in ECS encrypted or accessible to non-admin roles?
   3. How frequently are API keys rotated for Meal Planner apps?

2. **Assumptions**
   - The meal planner apps always use secure TLS channels and do not store their API keys insecurely.
   - The admin’s operating environment for the Web Control Plane is trusted (no local keyloggers/trojans).
   - ChatGPT integration is trusted except for potential prompt injection manipulation.
