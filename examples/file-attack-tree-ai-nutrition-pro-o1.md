# Threat Modeling Analysis for AI Nutrition-Pro Using Attack Trees

Below is a comprehensive threat modeling analysis for the AI Nutrition-Pro project. Because the CURRENT ATTACK TREE is empty, we are creating a new attack tree from scratch using information provided in the FILE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. UNDERSTAND THE PROJECT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1.1 Project Overview

AI Nutrition-Pro is a cloud-based application that provides AI-assisted nutrition-related content generation. It integrates with external Meal Planner applications and relies on ChatGPT for language model–driven content. The solution architecture is deployed on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) and consists of multiple components:

• API Gateway (Kong)
  – Handles authentication, rate limiting, and request filtering.
• Web Control Plane (Golang)
  – Deployed on ECS; used for administration, onboarding new clients, configuring applications, and overseeing billing.
• Control Plane Database (RDS)
  – Stores administrative data, client details, and configuration.
• API Application (Golang)
  – Deployed on ECS; provides AI-based nutrition content generation functionality.
• API Database (RDS)
  – Stores dietitians’ content samples, AI request/response logs, and references.
• External Systems
  – Meal Planner application (integrates via HTTPS/REST).
  – ChatGPT-3.5 (OpenAI’s LLM API).

### Key Functionalities and Typical Use Cases

1. Meal Planner applications upload dietitian content samples and retrieve AI-generated nutritional plans or content for end users.
2. The Web Control Plane provides administrative functions such as configuring clients, managing billing, and controlling system parameters.
3. The API Gateway enforces authentication (API keys per Meal Planner) and applies relevant rate-limiting and ACL rules.

### Dependencies
• AWS ECS for container orchestration.
• Amazon RDS for persistent storage of application and control plane data.
• ChatGPT-3.5 for advanced language model functionalities.
• Kong as an API Gateway.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. DEFINE THE ROOT GOAL OF THE ATTACK TREE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Compromise systems using AI Nutrition-Pro by exploiting weaknesses in AI Nutrition-Pro.”

This could involve:
• Gaining unauthorized access to AI Nutrition-Pro services or data.
• Injecting malicious code or configurations into the system.
• Disrupting or altering functionality to affect end users.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. IDENTIFY HIGH-LEVEL ATTACK PATHS (SUB-GOALS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To achieve the root goal, an attacker may pursue multiple strategies:

1. Compromise the Web Control Plane.
2. Exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the API Gateway.
3. Exploit vulnerabilities in the API Application.
4. Gain unauthorized access to the Databases (Control Plane DB or API DB).
5. Exploit CI/CD or container misconfigurations (supply chain attack).
6. Abuse ChatGPT integration (e.g., malicious prompt injection, pivot from external services).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. EXPAND EACH ATTACK PATH WITH DETAILED STEPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below are specific methods and techniques that could be used under each high-level path. Each sub-goal is generally connected via OR (i.e., the attacker only needs to succeed in one path to progress).

### 4.1 Compromise the Web Control Plane
• Exploit Web Application Vulnerabilities
  – SQL Injection, XSS, or command injection in administrative interfaces.
  – Privilege escalation through misconfigured role-based access controls.
• Credential Theft or Social Engineering
  – Phishing administrators to obtain their credentials.
  – Exploiting weak password policies for administrator accounts.

### 4.2 Exploit Vulnerabilities in the API Gateway
• API or Configuration Exploits
  – Misconfigured ACLs allowing broader access than intended.
  – Flaws in rate limiting that enable brute force or resource exhaustion attacks.
• Bypass Authentication/Authorization
  – Obtain or guess valid Meal Planner API keys.
  – Exploit unpatched security flaws in Kong or its plugins.

### 4.3 Exploit Vulnerabilities in the API Application
• Input Validation Failures
  – Injecting malicious data that the AI Application processes incorrectly (e.g., unsanitized user input leading to errors or leaked information).
• Dependencies / Library Exploits
  – Outdated or vulnerable Golang libraries.
• Logic Manipulation or Fuzzing
  – Sending malformed requests to identify unexpected behavior that reveals secrets or bypasses checks.

### 4.4 Unauthorized Access to Databases
• Direct Database Attacks
  – Leverage stolen credentials from compromised ECS tasks or environment variables to access the RDS instances.
• Lateral Movement from Compromised Components
  – If the Web Control Plane or API Application is compromised, pivot to the databases through misconfigured IAM roles or network security groups.

### 4.5 Exploit CI/CD or Container Misconfigurations (Supply Chain)
• Unauthorized Image Modifications
  – Inject malicious code into Docker images.
  – Tamper with container repository or build pipelines.
• Misconfigured AWS ECS or IAM Roles
  – Excessive privileges enable attacker to overwrite images or redeploy malicious containers.
• Source Control Compromise
  – Inject malicious commits into the codebase if an attacker can compromise Git repositories or CI/CD pipelines.

### 4.6 Abuse ChatGPT Integration
• Prompt Injection / Data Exfiltration
  – Manipulate ChatGPT prompts to leak sensitive data or produce unauthorized outputs.
• Malicious Content Injection
  – Use AI to generate content that includes hidden malicious payloads (phishing links, misinformation for meal plans, etc.).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. APPLY LOGICAL OPERATORS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the highest level, the root goal is achieved if ANY of the sub-goals (Compromise Web Control Plane, Exploit API Gateway, Exploit API Application, Access Databases, Exploit Container Misconfiguration, or Abuse ChatGPT Integration) is successful. Therefore, the top-level node is an [OR] node. Within each sub-goal, some steps might need to be combined ([AND]) or might be alternatives ([OR]).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. VISUALIZE THE ATTACK TREE (TEXT-BASED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a simplified text-based attack tree using indentation and symbols. “[OR]” means achieving any one child suffices; “[AND]” means all child steps must be met.

8. ANALYZE AND PRIORITIZE ATTACK PATHS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the attributes above:

• High-Risk Paths
  – Compromising the Web Control Plane through vulnerabilities or stolen admin credentials.
  – Exploiting misconfigurations in the CI/CD pipeline to modify container images (supply chain attack).
  – Vulnerable or outdated dependencies in the API Application (high likelihood, high impact if code is not regularly patched).

• Critical Nodes
  – Web Control Plane vulnerabilities: If taken over, the attacker can manage or disrupt the entire system.
  – Container or supply chain vulnerabilities: A single compromise can propagate malicious code to all AI Nutrition-Pro services.

• Justification
  – The Web Control Plane is a central administrative interface with broad privileges over application configuration and client data.
  – Supply chain or container misconfigurations have historically been leveraged for large-scale breaches.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. DEVELOP MITIGATION STRATEGIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Web Control Plane Security
   – Regular code reviews and security testing (SAST/DAST).
   – Strong authentication (MFA), strict password policies, and robust monitoring of admin access.
   – Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and safe coding practices.

2. API Gateway Hardening
   – Enforce strict ACLs and regularly audit them to prevent privilege creep.
   – Secure key management and rotation for API keys.
   – Keep Kong and its plugins updated to address known CVEs.

3. API Application Security
   – Implement strong input validation and sanitization.
   – Continuously track and update Golang libraries for security patches.
   – Employ fuzz testing and code reviews to detect logic flaws.

4. Database Access Control
   – Use least-privilege IAM roles and strong network segmentation (security groups, VPC).
   – Ensure credentials are rotated regularly and not stored in plaintext environment variables.
   – Monitor for abnormal queries or excessive usage patterns.

5. CI/CD & Container Hardening
   – Sign Docker images and verify integrity before deployment.
   – Restrict who can modify CI/CD configurations; integrate security checks (SCA, container vulnerability scanning).
   – Store and protect source control secrets in a secure vault (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).

6. ChatGPT Integration Safeguards
   – Implement content filtering and strict prompt controls to minimize the risk of data leakage.
   – Monitor for unusual or malicious patterns in user prompts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. SUMMARIZE FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Risks Identified
• High-impact compromise if the Web Control Plane is breached.
• Supply chain vulnerabilities can propagate malware into all deployments.
• Misconfiguration of AWS ECS or IAM roles enables lateral movement and data exfiltration.

### Recommended Actions
• Strengthen credentials and adopt MFA due to the high privilege nature of the Web Control Plane.
• Implement robust CI/CD security measures, including container image signing and vulnerability scanning.
• Perform routine audits of ACLs, firewall rules, and logs for suspicious activity.
• Keep dependencies updated and address known vulnerabilities quickly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Are there any existing intrusion detection/prevention systems or SIEM solutions monitoring the containers and network traffic?
2. How frequently are environment credentials rotated, and what is the current key management strategy?
3. Has the team conducted formal penetration testing on the Web Control Plane or the API Gateway?
4. We assume the environment is following AWS best practices for IAM role separation and least-privilege policies.
