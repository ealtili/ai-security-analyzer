## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

1. **Authentication Mechanism**: The architecture mentions API keys for authentication but doesn't specify how administrators authenticate to the Web Control Plane. We've assumed standard authentication mechanisms with potential for MFA.

2. **Network Architecture**: The document doesn't detail the network architecture (VPCs, subnets, etc.). We've assumed AWS best practices with proper network segmentation.

3. **Logging and Monitoring**: There's no mention of logging, monitoring, or alerting systems. We've assumed minimal implementation and highlighted where improvements are needed.

4. **Build and Deployment Pipeline**: The document doesn't describe the build and deployment process. We've assumed industry-standard CI/CD practices for Go applications on AWS.

5. **Data Classification**: The sensitivity of the dietitian content samples and generated AI content isn't specified. We've assumed this could include proprietary methodologies requiring protection.

6. **Scale of Operation**: The scale of the operation (number of tenants, request volume) isn't specified, which affects certain risk assessments, particularly for DoS threats.

7. **Regulatory Requirements**: No regulatory requirements are mentioned. Depending on the nature of the nutritional advice, there may be healthcare-related compliance requirements.

8. **LLM Integration Details**: The specific integration method with ChatGPT-3.5 isn't detailed. We've assumed standard API integration with OpenAI.
