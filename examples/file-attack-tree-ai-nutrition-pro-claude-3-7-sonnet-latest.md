## 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

### High-Risk Paths

1. **Prompt Injection (5.1)**
   - **Justification**: This attack has high likelihood due to the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs. It requires low effort but can have high impact by generating harmful nutritional advice that could cause health risks to end users. This is particularly concerning for a nutrition-focused application.

2. **Resource Exhaustion (2.1)**
   - **Justification**: Without proper rate limiting and complexity checks, this attack could be easily executed with low skill requirements. The impact would be service degradation for legitimate users and potentially high costs due to excessive LLM API usage.

3. **API Key Theft (3.1.1)**
   - **Justification**: Since the system relies on API keys for authentication of Meal Planner applications, stolen keys could allow unauthorized content generation, leading to financial losses and potential reputational damage.

4. **Dangerous Nutritional Advice Generation (5.1.1)**
   - **Justification**: This is the most harmful variant of prompt injection, as it could directly lead to health risks for end users who follow incorrect nutritional advice. The detection difficulty is high because subtle prompts might bypass filters.

### Critical Nodes

1. **API Gateway (Kong)**: This is a critical security control point that handles authentication, rate limiting, and input filtering. Vulnerabilities here would impact multiple attack paths.

2. **ChatGPT Prompt Handling**: How the system handles and sanitizes prompts before sending to ChatGPT is crucial to preventing prompt injection attacks.

3. **API Database Security**: This database stores sensitive dietitian content samples that could be targeted for exfiltration or poisoning.

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies

### For Prompt Injection (5.1)
1. Implement strict input validation and sanitization before passing content to the LLM
2. Create a prompt template system with immutable instructions that cannot be overridden by user input
3. Add a content review system that flags potentially harmful nutritional advice for human review
4. Implement output filtering to catch dangerous or inappropriate content before delivery

### For Resource Exhaustion (2.1)
1. Implement tiered rate limiting at both API Gateway and application levels
2. Add complexity analysis to reject or limit overly complex prompts
3. Set hard limits on request size, frequency, and the computational resources allocated per request
4. Monitor usage patterns to detect abnormal behavior indicative of resource abuse

### For API Key Theft (3.1.1)
1. Implement short-lived API keys with regular rotation
2. Add IP-based restrictions for API key usage where feasible
3. Monitor for unusual patterns of API key usage
4. Implement mutual TLS for more secure authentication

### For Dangerous Nutritional Advice Generation (5.1.1)
1. Implement a domain-specific content filter focused on nutritional safety
2. Use a layered approach combining prompt engineering, output filtering, and human review
3. Add specific guardrails for medical/nutritional content with explicit warnings about limitations
4. Consider a human-in-the-loop approach for sensitive nutritional information

### For Content Poisoning (5.2)
1. Implement approval workflows for new content samples
2. Conduct regular audits of stored dietitian samples
3. Use anomaly detection to identify potentially manipulated samples
4. Limit the ability to modify samples after initial upload

## 9. Summarize Findings

### Key Risks Identified

1. **AI-Specific Vulnerabilities**: The integration with ChatGPT-3.5 introduces unique risks like prompt injection and the potential generation of harmful nutritional advice.

2. **Resource Abuse**: The computational expense of LLM operations creates opportunities for economic denial of service attacks.

3. **Authentication Weaknesses**: Reliance on API keys for authentication introduces risks if those keys are compromised.

4. **Data Sensitivity**: The system stores valuable intellectual property (dietitians' content samples) that could be targeted for exfiltration.

5. **Complex Attack Surface**: The distributed architecture with multiple containers and databases creates a complex attack surface with various entry points.

### Recommended Actions

1. Implement robust input validation and prompt engineering techniques to prevent prompt injection attacks.

2. Design a comprehensive rate limiting strategy that accounts for computational complexity, not just request frequency.

3. Enhance API key management with additional security controls and monitoring.

4. Add a layered content safety system specific to nutritional advice.

5. Implement rigorous access controls and monitoring for the API database containing dietitian samples.

6. Conduct regular security testing specifically focused on AI-related vulnerabilities.

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

### Questions
1. How is content validated before it's sent to the ChatGPT API?
2. Are there rate limits implemented at both the API Gateway and application levels?
3. What monitoring exists for detecting abnormal usage patterns?
4. How are API keys managed and rotated?
5. Is there any human review in the content generation pipeline?

### Assumptions
1. The system allows dietitians to upload content samples that are used to guide AI-generated content.
2. Authentication relies primarily on API keys for Meal Planner applications.
3. The generated content is nutritional advice that could impact human health if incorrect.
4. There is no human review in the standard content generation flow.
5. The API Gateway (Kong) handles most security controls like authentication and rate limiting.
