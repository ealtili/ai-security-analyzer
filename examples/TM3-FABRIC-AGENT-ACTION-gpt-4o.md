# Threat Model for Fabric Agent Action

## Attack Surface Identification

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - **Entry Point**: `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`, `.github/workflows/publish.yaml`, `.github/workflows/update-fabric-patterns.yaml`
   - **Potential Vulnerabilities**: Unauthorized access to workflows, misuse of secrets, and excessive API usage.
   - **Description**: Workflows are triggered on push and pull requests, and they use secrets for API keys.

2. **Docker Container**:
   - **Entry Point**: `Dockerfile`
   - **Potential Vulnerabilities**: Insecure Docker image configurations, outdated base images.
   - **Description**: The Dockerfile uses `python:3.11-alpine` as the base image and installs dependencies using Poetry.

3. **API Integrations**:
   - **Entry Point**: `fabric_agent_action/llms.py`
   - **Potential Vulnerabilities**: API key exposure, unauthorized API access.
   - **Description**: Integrates with OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic APIs using environment variables for API keys.

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - **Entry Point**: `entrypoint.sh`, `action.yml`
   - **Potential Vulnerabilities**: Exposure of sensitive information through environment variables.
   - **Description**: Uses environment variables for configuration and API keys.

5. **Python Scripts**:
   - **Entry Point**: `fabric_agent_action/app.py`, `fabric_agent_action/agents.py`
   - **Potential Vulnerabilities**: Code injection, improper input validation.
   - **Description**: Core logic for executing fabric patterns and managing agents.

6. **External Dependencies**:
   - **Entry Point**: `pyproject.toml`
   - **Potential Vulnerabilities**: Dependency vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks.
   - **Description**: Manages dependencies using Poetry, including various langchain libraries.

## Threat Enumeration

1. **Spoofing**:
   - Unauthorized users could spoof GitHub actions to trigger workflows.
   - Exploit: Use a compromised GitHub account to push code or create pull requests.

2. **Tampering**:
   - Malicious actors could modify Docker images or scripts.
   - Exploit: Inject malicious code into Dockerfile or Python scripts.

3. **Repudiation**:
   - Lack of logging could allow users to deny actions taken.
   - Exploit: Modify workflows without leaving a trace.

4. **Information Disclosure**:
   - Exposure of API keys or sensitive data through environment variables.
   - Exploit: Access environment variables through misconfigured workflows.

5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**:
   - Excessive API calls could lead to service disruption.
   - Exploit: Trigger workflows repeatedly to exhaust API limits.

6. **Elevation of Privilege**:
   - Unauthorized access to higher privileges through misconfigured workflows.
   - Exploit: Gain access to sensitive operations by exploiting workflow permissions.

## Impact Assessment

1. **Spoofing**:
   - Impact: Unauthorized access to workflows, potential data leakage.
   - Severity: High

2. **Tampering**:
   - Impact: Compromise of code integrity, potential backdoors.
   - Severity: High

3. **Repudiation**:
   - Impact: Difficulty in tracking changes, potential for undetected malicious activity.
   - Severity: Medium

4. **Information Disclosure**:
   - Impact: Exposure of sensitive information, potential for further attacks.
   - Severity: High

5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**:
   - Impact: Service disruption, potential financial loss due to API overuse.
   - Severity: Medium

6. **Elevation of Privilege**:
   - Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive operations, potential data manipulation.
   - Severity: High

## Threat Ranking

1. **Information Disclosure** - High likelihood and impact.
2. **Spoofing** - High likelihood and impact.
3. **Tampering** - High impact, medium likelihood.
4. **Elevation of Privilege** - High impact, medium likelihood.
5. **Denial of Service (DoS)** - Medium impact and likelihood.
6. **Repudiation** - Medium impact, low likelihood.

## Mitigation Recommendations

1. **Information Disclosure**:
   - Use GitHub secrets for all sensitive data.
   - Regularly rotate API keys and monitor their usage.

2. **Spoofing**:
   - Implement strict access controls and use GitHub's branch protection rules.
   - Use signed commits to verify the authenticity of code changes.

3. **Tampering**:
   - Regularly scan Docker images and dependencies for vulnerabilities.
   - Implement code reviews and automated security checks.

4. **Elevation of Privilege**:
   - Limit permissions for GitHub actions and workflows.
   - Use least privilege principle for all operations.

5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**:
   - Implement rate limiting for API calls.
   - Monitor workflow executions and set alerts for unusual activity.

6. **Repudiation**:
   - Enable detailed logging for all workflows and actions.
   - Use GitHub's audit logs to track changes and access.
